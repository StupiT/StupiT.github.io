<m9>   ☞ AN EXTRAORDINARY AND REMARKABLE
CURE—MRS. MARY DILLON, Williamsburgh, corner of
Fourth and North streets, completely restored to health by the
treatment of DR. WM. EVANS, 100 Chatham street.
   The symptoms of this distressing case were as follows:—Total
loss of appetite, palpitation of the heart, twitching of the tendons,
with a general spasmodic affection of the muscles, difficulty of
breathing, giddiness, languor, lassitude, great depression of spirits,
with a fear of some impending evil, a sensation of fluttering at
the pit of the stomach, irregular transient pains in different parts,
great emaciation, with other symptoms of extreme debility.
   The above case was pronounced hopeless by three of the most
eminent physicians, and the dissolution of the patient daily await-
ed for by her friends, which may be authenticated by the physi-
cians who were in attendance. She has given her cheerful per-
mission to publish the above facts, and will also gladly give any
information respecting the benefit she has received, to any en-
quiring mind.					MARY DILLON.

   ☞ ANOTHER TEST of the efficacy of Dr. J. L. PA-
RIS'S SOOTHING SYRUP for Infants Teething, from Mr.
Wm. Johnson, 248 Hudson Street, New York.
   Dear Sir—The great benefit afforded to my suffering infant by
your Soothing Syrup, in a case of protracted and painful dentition
must convince every feeling parent how essential an early applica-
tion of such an invaluable medicine is to alleviate infant misery
and torture. My infant when teething, experienced such severe
sufferings, that it was attacked with convulsions, and my wife and
family supposed that death would soon release the babe from an-
guish, till we procured a bottle of your Syrup, which, as soon as
applied to the gums, a wonderful change was produced, and after
a few applications, the child displayed obvious relief, and by con-
tinuing in its use, I am glad to inform you the child had complete-
ly recovered, and no recurrence of that awful complaint has since
occurred; the teeth are emanating daily, and the child enjoys
perfect health. I give you my cheerful permission to make the
acknowledgment public, and will gladly give information on the
circumstance.						WM. JOHNSON.

			ON LOW SPIRITS.
<m9>   ☞ Low spirits is a certain state of the mind, accompanied
by indigestion, wherein the greatest evils are apprehended upon the
slightest grounds, and the worst consequences imagined. An-
cient medical writers supposed this disease to be confined to those
particular regions of the abdomen technically called hypochon-
dria, which are situated on the right side of that cavity, whence
comes the name hypochondriasis.
				<small><u title="SYMPTOMS">SMPTOMS</u>.</small>
   The common corporeal symptoms are, flatulency in the stomach
or bowels, acrid eructations, costiveness, spasmodic pains, giddi-
ness, dimness of sight, palpitations, and often an utter inability of
fixing the attention upon any subject of importance, or engaging in
anything that demands vigor or courage. Also languidness—the
mind becomes irritable, thoughtful, desponding, melancholy, and
dejected, accompanied with a total derangement of the nervous
system. The mental feelings and peculiar train of ideas that
haunt the imagination and overwhelm the judgment, exhibit an in-
finite diversity. The wisest and best of men are as open to this
affliction as the weakest.
				<small>CAUSES.</small>
   A sedentary life of any kind, especially severe study, protract-
ed to a late hour in the night, and rarely relieved by social inter-
course, or exercise, a dissolute habit, great excess in eating and
drinking, the immoderate use of mercury, violent purgatives, the
suppression of some habitual discharge, (as the obstruction of the
menses,) or long continued eruption; relaxation or debility of one
or more important organs within the abdomen, is a frequent
cause.
				<small>TREATMENT.</small>
   The principal objects of treatment are, to remove indigestion, to
strengthen the body, and to enliven the spirits, which may be pro-
moted by exercise, early hours, regular meals, and pleasant con-
versation—the bowels (if costive) being carefully regulated by
the occasional use of a mild aperient. We know nothing better
calculated to obtain this end, than Dr. Wm. Evans' Aperient
Pills, being mild and certain in their operation. The bowels be-
ing once cleansed, his inestimable Camomile Pills, (which are
tonic, anodyne, and anti-spasmodic) are an infallible remedy, and
without dispute have proved a great blessing to the numerous pub-
lic.
   Some physicians have recommended a free use of mercury, but
it should not be resorted to; as in many cases it will greatly ag-
gravate the <u title="symptoms">symtoms</u>.
   The medical office of Dr. WM. EVANS is at No. 100
Chatham st., and at No. 19 North Eighth street, Philadelphia;
where his Camomile, as well as his excellent Family Aperient
Pills, may be obtained. Sold also by his advertised country

					L<small>OWELL</small>, Nov. 15, 1836.
   D<small>EAR</small> S<small>IR</small>,—Knowing by experience that every reference
that the afflicted receive of the beneficial results of medicines,
I cheerfully offer mine to the public, in behalf of Dr. Wil-
liam Evans' Camomile Pills. I have been afflicted for the
last ten years, with distress in the head and chest; often so
bad as to deprive me of sleep for three or four nights in suc-
cession, but have never found relief by any of my friends'
prescriptions, until my wife saw the advertisement in the pa-
per; when she persuaded me to send for some, which I did,
and obtained two boxes and bottles, which resulted in al-
most completely restoring me to health, although I have not
yet entirely finished them. Should you consider this any
benefit to yourself, or the public, you have my cheerful per-
mission to publish it. Your's respectfully,

   ☞ PARALYTIC RHEUMATISM—A perfect cure
effected by the treatment of Dr. WM. EVANS.—Mr. John
Gibson, of North Fourth street, Williamsburgh, afflicted
with the above complaint for three years and nine months,
during this time he had to use crutches. His chief symptoms
were excruciating pain in all his joints, but especially in the
hip, shoulders, knees, and ankles, and aggravation of the
pains towards night; and for the most part all times from
external heat, an obvious thickening of the fascia and liga-
ments, with a complete loss of muscular power. For the
benefit of those afflicted in a similar manner, Mr. Gibson
conceives it meet to say that the pains have entirely ceased,
and that his joints have completely recovered their natural
tone, and he feels able to resume his ordinary business.

<b style="letter-spacing:.2em"><cl>C</cl>HILDREN TEETHING.</b>—Children generally
suffer much uneasiness from the cutting of their teeth.—
Whatever dangerous or fatal symptoms attend the process of na-
ture, they are produced invariably from the highly irritated and
inflamed condition of the parts; therefore the principal indications
of cure are to abate the inflammation, and to soften, soothe and
relax the GUMS. If that is effected the infant is preserved from
subsequent fever, infatuation, spasmodic cough, twitching of ten-
dons, croup, canker, and convulsions displaying their fatal conse-
quences. If mothers, nurses or guardians have their babes tortu-
red with painful or protracted dentition, and this notice attracts
their attention, they should not be deterred from purchasing a
bottle of Paris' celebrated SOOTHING SYRUP FOR CHIL-
DREN TEETHING—the incomparable virtue of which in
completely relieving the most distressing cases (where applied to
the infant's gums as directed) is invaluable. The remedy has re-
stored thousands of children when on the verge of the grave to the

   <i>Dreadful Affray</i>.—Yesterday morning about 4 o'clock,
the coroner was called to the house of Lawrence <u>Gaff-
ny</u>, corner of Broome and <u title="Willett">Willitt</u> streets, to examine
<s>into</s> the case of Peter <u>Fitz Patrick</u>, lying there in a dying
state, from the effects of a blow which he had received
about an hour previous at that house. From the evi-
dence of Lawrence <u>Gaffny</u>, it appeared that he had
opened the house about three days before, and gave a
house warming, as it is termed, on Tuesday night, ha-
ving there about <s>??</s> of his friends, and a fiddler to enliven
the <s>wake</s>. He only occupied the lower floor, consist-
ing of a front room used for selling liquor, and the back
room occupied by his family. Every thing went on very
well until about two o'clock in the morning, when one
of his company having imbibed too much blue rum, be-
<s>came</s> somewhat noisy. Just at this time, (according to
Gaffney's statement,) four young men came into the front
room, one of whom went into the back room where the
company was assembled, and as the other was attempt-
<s>ing to go in</s>, Gaffney said he had better not, when he re-
<s>????</s> from the door. The young man who went into the
<s>back</s> room soon got into trouble with some of the men,
<s>?????</s> came out, clinched with one of Gaffney's com-
<s>pany</s>. Gaffney parted them, and telling him that if he
<s>would</s> not behave civilly, he had better go out, put him
<s>out of the</s> front door, his friends following very quietly.
Very soon afterwards the front door was forced in, and
<u><s>Fitz</s> Patrick</u>, who was standing close to it, turned round
<s>to</s> see who was the intruder, when he received a stab in
<s>??????</s> groin, which cut through the femoral vein, and
<s>???? him</s> lying on the floor in a deplorable condition.
<s>Two others</s> of the company, named Peter Delaney and
<s>Edward Denman</s>, came up at once to see the affray
<s>that</s> was going on, when they received wounds from the
<s>same person</s> who stabbed <u>Fitz Patrick</u>, which are likely
<s>???rove</s> fatal, Delaney being stabbed in the abdomen,
<s>?????</s> navel, and Denman over the right temple, both
<s>??? severely</s> and in all probability mortally.
   <s>The</s> authors of this disgraceful outraged then cleared
<s>?????</s> though pursued made out to effect their escape.
<s>?????</s> Wright, a watchman, stationed on that post, and
<s>?????</s> near the scene nearly the whole time, was ex-
<s>amined, but his</s> testimony amounted to nothing, he hav-
<d>[Col.2]</d>
ing been most dreadfully frightened, or most stupidly
ignorant—or his testimony has been wofully misrepre-
sented. He stated that he saw four young men come
to the door of Gaffney's house, where they waited about
<s>15</s> minutes, and he then advised them to go off, which
advice they took, and departed. Soon afterwards his
attention was attracted to a female going along bare-
headed, and while speaking to her, he heard a noise in
Gaffney's house, and ran back to see what it was. When
he got there, he saw a young man (one of the four who
had been there before,) stab a man (on the inside of the
door) with a knife or dirk, and the wounded man falling
upon him, rolled him nearly into the gutter, and by the
time he could get up and give the alarm rap, the rioters
were off.
   Yesterday four young men, whose names are annexed,
were held to bail by the Coroner in $300 each, to appear
and testify in this case. They stated that they were
among the party concerned; that they, and one other,
named John Scott, were at Frost's oyster house, in Grand
street, and started to go down to Gaffney's to see what
was going on, having been informed that there was a
muss there. The rest has been already detailed, and
suspicion is firmly fixed upon a young man named <u>Israel</u>
White, as having committed the outrage, for Gaffney
and the other witnesses testified that the companions of
White did not aid or abet the person who committed the
outrage at all, but remained peaceable. The names of
the four held to bail are Alfred Pierce, 18 Cannon
street, Wm. H. <u title="Hales (elsewhere)">Hale</u>, 22 Cannon street, Wm. Timp-
son, East Broadway, and John Pelzer, 568 Grand street.
A young man named Wm. <u>Bloom</u>, was yesterday after-
noon arrested by Marshals Pierce and Woolly, charged
with having participated in the outrage, and was reman-
ded for further examination.
   <u>Fitz Patrick</u> died soon after the coroner left him, but
was unable to speak from the moment of receiving the
wound. The others are now at their homes, Delaney
at <s title="34 OR ??">94</s> Pitt street, and Denman corner of <u title="Willett">Willitt</u> and De-
lancey streets, both in very precarious situations.
   In the case of <u>Fitz Patrick</u>, the jury returned a verdict
that the wound of which he was then dying, (at the time
of the inquest) was inflicted by some person or persons
unknown.
   The above are all the facts that could be gathered from
the minutes as taken by the Coroner, and it will be seen
that it is left to conjecture how many persons were con-
nected in the affair, and in fact the reporter has inserted
one more name than appears in any part of the testimo-
ny that was placed at his disposal. This case is likely
to be one of great and exciting interest, and should a
trial ever come on, the coroner's minutes would be of
little more service than would the evidence of a person
who had never heard of the transaction. In such cases
as the present, <i>minutiae</i> are sometimes the only link in
the chain of evidence, that can fasten the guilt upon the
proper persons, and unless these are more attended to, a
coroner's inquest might readily be avoided, were it not
for the $<s>5</s> fee allowed by law. To show that this is not
written without proper motives, we will mention one or
two facts. One young man (<u>Bloom</u>) has been arrested,
because he tallied with the description given by a watch-
man, but he has not been confronted with either of the
men, who are now probably dying, to ascertain if he
could be recognized as a participator in the outrage.
The principal witnesses (Gaffney and the watchman)
swear there were four men concerned, and four have
already been held to bail to appear and testify; one has
been arrested on suspicion, and a warrant is out against
another, making six. This discrepancy is not explained
by any evidence taken before the coroner. This is de-
cidedly wrong, and if the three or four rubs that Mr.
Coroner Wheeler has received at the hands of the Dis-
trict Attorney when trying murder cases, (he having felt
the want of such testimony) is not sufficient, some other
and more public method must be taken to make him ac-
quainted with his duties and responsibilities.

Coroner yesterday obtained information which
scarcely leaves any doubt who is the person that
stabbed the men in <u title="Willett">Willet</u> street, and the Police
are in search of him. Delaney and Denman are
both likely to recover, although by no means out
of danger, particularly Delaney.
   Besides the three persons mentioned in yester-
day's paper, it turns out that a fourth was also
wounded on the same occasion, and, as is suppo-
sed, by the same person. His name is Patrick
Dase, and his residence is in Ferry street. Al-
though severely wounded in the abdomen, Dase
did not discover it until he had walked some dis-
tance towards home, and the first intimation he
had of being wounded, was from the blood trick-
ling down his leg. The wound is not considered
dangerous.—[Jour. Com.]

   M<small>URDER</small>.—About two weeks since, Lawrence
Gaffney hired a house at the corner of Willett and
Broome streets, which he fitted up as a tavern. On
Tuesday, he invited a party to “a house warming.”
Every thing went on peaceably, and in the most
perfect good humor, until about 2 or 3 o'clock,
when ten or fifteen young men came to the house
and entered the bar room. Hearing music in the
adjoining room, one of the party, named William
<u>Bloome</u>, rushed into the room, and began to push
about the persons assembled, and disturbed the
evening's amusements, in which he was aided by
his companions. The landlord and some of his
friends made an attempt to thrust them out into
the street. Just as they had reached the door, one
of the party drew a dirk, and stabbed Peter Fitz-
patrick in the groin. He immediately fell. The
same hand next stabbed Peter Delaney, another of
landlord's friends, in the abdomen; he also fell,
and his wound is supposed to be mortal. The next
man stabbed was Edward Denman. He was
wounded over the right ear, but not dangerously.
   The Coroner was called and immediately pro-
ceeded to hold an examination upon Fitzpatrick,
but he died soon after the arrival of the Coroner.
   An inquest was held upon the body, and a ver-
dict of “death from wounds inflicted by some per-
sons unknown” returned by the jury.
   <u>Bloome</u> has since been arrested as the per-
son who stabbed the three individuals above
named. The situation of one of them, Delaney,
is very precarious. Patrick Dase was also cut by
a sharp instrument, but without being aware of it
at the time, supposing that he was struck with a
stick. Although his wound was a severe one, it is
thought he will soon recover.

		<m8>[Reported for the Courier & Enquirer.]</m8>
   <i>Gross Outrage and Singular Developments</i>.—Our rea-
ders will recollect that some months since, a trial was had
at the General Sessions Court of a case of libel, in which
G. W. D. Andrews, and Geo. Craigen, the Editor of the
“Advocate of Moral Reform,” were parties—and that
this libel grew out of the publication of a report of a suit
tried before a Justice's Court at Jersey City, for the re-
covery of certain money alleged as due by Dr. William
Evans, of 100 Chatham street, to a person residing at
Hoboken, for the board of the Doctor and his <i>lady</i>. The
matter of the lady was at the time somewhat shrouded
in mystery, but there is, however, in the present case
which we have to relate, a <i>lady</i> named <i>Anna S. Powell</i>,
who is said to belong to a very respectable family in the
western part of this State, and which <i>lady</i>, were are in-
formed, is now confined in the Lunatic Asylum at Bloom-
ingdale.
   Some eighteen months since, Dr. Evans was called
before the police, to answer to a certain charge in which
Miss Anna S. Powell appeared as the complainant.
   A hearing was had before the Police Justices, and
the result was an order against Dr. Evans for the sup-
port of a <i>bastard child</i>.
   From this decision the Doctor appealed and on his gi-
ving the requisite bail, the cause was carried up to the
sessions court.
   The trial eventually came on in this court, and Miss
Powell, the principal witness on the part of the people,
(or commissioners of the almshouse) failing to appear,
a case was not made out against the accused, and he was
acquitted.
   Subsequently, on instituting the requisite enquiries
the commissioners ascertained that the reason why Miss
Powell did not appear on the occasion of the trial, was,
that she had been inveigled away, or abducted by Dr.
Evans.
   The <s>matter</s> has recently brought to a partial issue, by
<d>[Col.3]</d>
the issue of a warrant by the commissioners, for the ar-
rest of Dr. Evans, on the charge of abducting the wit-
ness, Miss Powell.
   This warrant was put into the hands of Mr. Josiah
Burton, one of the city <u title="marshals">marshalls</u>, who was specially de-
putised by the Sheriff for its execution.
   In pursuance of this duty, Mr. Burton went on Mon-
day afternoon to the office of Doctor Evans, (whom he
did not know,) and enquired if the latter was at home.
   Not receiving a satisfactory reply from several per-
sons who were in attendance at the office, he proceeded
to search the premises, and while thus engaged, he was
assaulted, shamefully beaten, and turned out of the of-
fice by two of the persons present, named George W.
Straight, and —— Goeffrey, or Harvey. Mr. Burton
then went to the police and entered a complaint, and a
warrant was issued for the arrest of the persons above
named, and put into the hands of Officer Place, who went
to the office and found the door fastened, and his admis-
sion and authority otherwise resisted by the threats of
the parties within.
   Mr. Place then returned to the police, and procuring
the aid of several other officers, the whole party re-
turned to the scene of action where, not till the door
was broken open could an entrance be effected.
   The two persons above named were arrested and
taken to the police, and in default of $1000 bail required
they were both committed for trial for the assault.
   Dr. Evans, during the confusion of the moment, <u title="effected">af-
fected</u> his escape, and was not found till yesterday,
when he gave the necessary bail. The other two hope-
ful individuals who so valiantly defended the Doctor's
person and premises, also procured bail, and were lib-
erated from custody; and thus the matter for the pre-
sent rests.

COURT OF OYER AND TERMINER—Yesterday.
   <i>Trial of Ezra White for the murder of Peter Fitzpat-
rick.—Second day</i>.—Lemuel <u title="Stark (elsewhere)">Starke</u>, called and examin-
ed for the prosecution, said—I live at 330 Front street.
I am a caulker—I am 23 or 24 years of age—I know
Ezra White—I have known him about 7 years—I was
in his company on the night of the 13th of February last.
We met in Grand street, on the corner of Willett and
Grand. We met that night as usual. There was no
appointment. We met between 8 and 9 in the evening.
He had a black hat on and crape round it, and a steel
mixed coat, a kind of a gray. It was a coatee. His
pantaloons were black. We went down to Elm street.
We staid there an hour. From thence we went right
up town to a dance. There were three or four others
with us—John Roberts, Peter Rice, and Jimmy Dupee.
We went to Francis Spaight's dance in Elm street. I
and White left the dance in Elm street, and we went
up town to a dance. I don't know the name of the man
who keeps the house. We staid there about three or
four hours. I don't know what hour we left. When
we left I was accompanied by White, Wm. Wright, Bob
Leigh, and my brother Joseph Starke, and three or four
others, whose names I don't remember. I, my brother,
and White went across to Grand street, where we staid
about half an hour. We were all sober except White.
He was a little intoxicated. When we left Grand street,
we went round to Gaffney's house in <u title="Willett">Willet</u> street.
There were three ahead of us, Pierce, my brother, and
Timpson. I and White were about 15 yards behind
them. Those ahead got in, I think, before we did, all
but Pierce. I don't think he went in at all. My brother
and Timpson did. I didn't see them enter the store. I
and White went in as soon as we got to the door in <u title="Willett">Wil-
let</u> street. I went right in and leaned on the counter.
They were quarrelling among themselves when we
went in. Some one down to Frost's said there was a
dance down in <u title="Willett">Willet</u> street. White said we'll go
down there and stay a few minutes, and then we'll go
home. We had no conversation on the way about the
dance. White went in and was going through into the
back room. As he was doing so, three or four catched
hold of him. They never told him to go out, but pulled
him all round. I went up and spoke to the landlord,
and said if you'll get them men off from him I'll get him
out of the house. He made me no answer. I went and
took hold of him, and got him pretty much clear of them
and put him out.
   I was entirely out myself. They caught hold of him
and held him away from me. I got him again, when
two or three rushed out after him again on the walk
and got hold of him. I gave one of them a shove, and
said why don't you let him alone, I want to get him out.
And I said to him come let us go home. White says I
have been ill used a good deal. We went in the house
side by side. I went to the counter and he went to-
wards the back room. I did not hear him say a word,
but when they clinched him, he said let me go. Noth-
ing was said by any body to White; they met him and
caught him by the chest right away. There were about
a dozen persons in the room, pretty much in the middle
of the floor.
They stood so as to obstruct the passage to the back
room. I did not see him run against any one. The
landlord was near the counter on the outside. I don't
recollect that any one said any thing about a muss. We
had to pull very hard to get him (White) away. He
wanted to get away. The reason why White would not
go home with me after I got him out was because he
was intoxicated and felt riled about being choked. I
said, let us go now. He replied he would go in a few
minutes. I pulled him out twice. The first I saw of
the watchman, was when they rushed out on the walk.
Pierce was also on the walk, I do not know where
Timpson was. The door was closed by one, I do not
know by whom. White at this time was right on the
corner. At the time the door was closed, I had hold of
White on the corner. We staid there five or six min-
utes, during which time I had hold of him. I did not
see the door opened at all during this time. We conti-
nued to stand there about five or six minutes. I went
up Broome street, and left White standing right on the
corner. I returned, found the door open and White
standing on the stoop.
   He was rather in Willett street.
   I <u>did'nt</u> see White doing anything; the door was open-
ed that I could see in and persons inside.
   I <u>did'nt</u> see it shut again; nobody said anything to
White, nor he to them.
   The watchman rapped, and I said come let us go; so
we went away.
   White stayed there about a minute, during which I
saw him do nothing; we went up Broome street, and I
went home.
   We went together as far as Walnut street, to White's
brother's, where I staid a few minutes; I then left and
went down to Reader's in Walnut street, where I saw
White; I saw no dirk or sharp instrument that night
nor do I know from anything White said to me that he
had any weapon that night; when I saw him at Read-
er's he had on a fur hat and cape, and a steel mixed
coat, and black pantaloons; I think they were the same
clothes he had on at Gaffney's; I staid at <u>Readers</u> a few
minutes and left White there; I next saw him about 12
o'clock on the morning of the same day at his mother's
at Brooklyn. I slept at home that morning. I went
over to his mother's house—I didn't go in. He came
out into the street in about half an hour after I got there.
I didn't go by any arrangement. White's brother went
over with me. White (the prisoner) had on the same
clothing that I have stated. We crossed the ferry and
went over the battery to a steamboat lying in the East
River, where the Boston boats start from. We went
on board the Boston boat into the cabin. When we left
his mother's house I did not know at all where he was
going. I asked White whether he was going away,
and he said he didn't know whether he was or not.—
Nothing else was said between us. There was no con-
versation between witness and White's brother in the
presence of the prisoner from the time they left his mo-
ther's house until they reached the boat, nor was there
any on board before we left the wharf. Our names were
entered as passengers before the boat left. She left
about four o'clock in the afternoon—my brother went
ashore—I and White, the prisoner, went to Providence,
which place we reached in the morning. White paid his
own passage. I didn't know what names he gave. We
talked about one thing and another. White told me he
was going to Boston. I told him I didn't care where he
went. He said he was going there to get a vessel to go
further. I told him I didn't care, I'd go with him. We
calculated about going to New Orleans if we could get a
<d>[Col.4]</d>
chance. He said we would go if he could get a chance.
The chances are as good at Boston of getting there as
they are here. I told him I did not calculate to stay
more than three or four months. He said he made the
same calculation. When we got to Boston we went to
some house to sleep; a man showed us the place. It
was in an alley, a boarding house. We staid there three
or four nights. During the day we were around Boston.
At the time we arrived we had some conversation about
the affair. I heard before we left the city that Fitzpat-
rick had got killed. He said he had heard the same. I
said I was innocent. I had no knife with me <i>that</i> night.
He said the same. White commenced that conversation.
He told me he did not believe there was any one killed. I
told him I did not know. I had heard there was 3 killed.
I didn't see nothing of it. He had on the clothes he left
this city with, all except the shirt, when he reached Bos-
ton. I had no other clothes than what I stood in. He
had 1 or 2 pair of pantaloons, and 2 or 3 shirts. I can
not say whether he had changed the shirt he had on the
night of the affray. The next day after we arrived in
Boston he tried to procure a ship to go to N. Orleans, but
could not get one. We were arrested on a Monday. I
had his coat on, and he had mine. We changed because
he had an overcoat, and his coat was better then mine.
We had no other reason for the change. I suggested it
to him. I have seen White have a knife. I saw him
with one 3 or 4 months before the affray. The blade
was 3 or 4 inches long, straight, sharp on one side. I
don't know where it is now. I had it in my hand and
threw it on to the ice, and broke the point off.
   Cross-examined by D. Graham, Sen.—The knife was
left square at the point. It was not an uncommon knife.
I have seen workmen have such knives.
   The men at Gaffney's appeared to be all in liquor.
They appeared to be angry, and their hands were a go-
ing, whether they had hold of one another or no, I can't
say. We went there peaceably and with peaceable in-
tentions. I did not see any of my party provoke any of
these men, either by word or action. I did not see
White strike or provoke any one. I did not hear the cry
of murder that night. The watchman did not conduct
himself as if any thing was wrong. Neither White,
<u title="Pierce (elsewhere)">Pearce</u>, or my brother said any thing about any body ha-
ving been wounded all the time we were there. The
noise was going on inside (Gaffney's) when the watch-
man rapped. I heard the next morning that 3 persons
had been stabbed, and knowing I had been there, although
I was satisfied of my innocence, I thought I would go
away. I thought I might be blamed for it.
   White said he was as innocent as I was. I knew of
nothing to compel him to go away, nor did he state to
me any thing to compel him to go. I saw a knife on the
meat bench at Gaffney's. It was a carving knife. This
bench or block stood on the right, near to the door, close
to the wall. I saw the knife lying there when I went in,
and not when I went out. Any of our party had a
chance of taking it up—that is a fact. I didn't see any
of them take it up. The handle of the knife was close
by the edge of the block. I saw no knife of that kind
in the hand of White. If he had had such a knife, I
think it was probable I should have seen it.
   Some questions was here put to the witness, in which
an allusion was made to what the District Attorney had
done in his direct examination.
   The District Attorney rose and objected to this mode
of conducting the case, and was sustained by the court.
   Mr. Graham replied sharply to the court, and said he
had been censured much too often.
   The court directed the case to proceed.
   By Mr. Graham to the witness—Tell us about White
having complained of his throat.
   Witness—Put the question right, and I will answer it
right if I can. I asked White to exchange clothes, to
enable me to appear finer on Sunday. We were arrest-
ed at Boston by officers sent on from this city. White
was examined before the upper police. I was not.—
Justice Palmer told me I must be a witness against Mr.
White, and then I should not be examined at all. Jus-
tice Taylor called me up for examination, and I refused
to answer any questions, in consequence of what Mr.
Palmer had said to me. I was discharged without giv-
ing or being required to enter into bail, except to appear
as a witness.
   James Riley called and examined for the prosecution.
I reside at 60 Willett street. In February I lived at 49.
I am married. I knew Peter Fitzpatrick. I was not at
Gaffney's that night. I didn't belong to the party. I
came by that way. I was coming down the walk, and
Peter Fitzpatrick was standing on the side walk. I saw
him stumble over against the watchman. Then I didn't
know what was the matter with him. I saw the prison-
er go up to him, and he (Fitzpatrick) fell, but what he
did to him I don't know. Fitzpatrick got up again and
waked into the house. The prisoner, when I first saw
him, made a step or two towards the deceased. While
I was standing there, I heard that a man was killed.—
It was said loud enough to be heard outside (Gaffney's.)
   By the Court—How loud was it said?
   Witness—Well, I don't know, I didn't rule it. I went
for a surgeon. I ran all the way. The doctor came
with me immediately. I then went into Gaffney's, and
saw Fitzpatrick. Saw the wound, it was in his groins,
and I staid with him till he died, when I helped to car-
ry him home. When I first saw White and Fitzpatrick
there was no quarreling and no noise. They seemed to
me to be all good humored together. I saw no blood
outside, but some inside (Gaffney's) when I came back.
   Cross-examined—I had been out that night with my
wife. I was returning home. When I left her I be-
lieve it was between one and two o'clock. I had seen
White before that night. I was a little acquainted with
him. I saw another wounded person after I saw Fitz-
patrick. It was Mr. <u title="Denman (elsewhere)">Denny</u>—he had a gash on his head.
He was in the bar room. I did not see any one holding
White. There were some persons near him.
   By the Court—Did Fitzpatrick appear to be in liquor?
   Witness—It is difficult to tell whether dead men have
been in liquor or not. I did not see any thing in White's
hand, nor did I see him put his hand into his pockets.
I did not speak to him. I knew White as soon as I saw
him. I have seen him gambling with others on the
Hook. I looked on. I have seen him gambling two or
three times. It was with thimbles they were doing
something. Money was bet on it.
   By a Juror—Was Fitzpatrick stabbed inside the house
or outside?
   Witness—Outside.
   By <u>W</u>. Graham—How do you know he was stabbed?
   Witness—I don't know, only that I saw him fall.
   At the close of the examination of this witness, the
Court took a recess until four o'clock.
   On the re-assembling of the court, the first witness cal-
led, was
   Wm. B. Timpson.—I am an Engineer by profession.
Know the prisoner. On the night of the affray, was at
Frost's <u title="Refectory">Refrectory</u>, and there heard that there was a
dance at Gaffney's—Joseph Starke, Alfred Pierce, Hen-
ry Haynes and John Pelzer, were with me. It was be-
tween two and 3 o'clock when we went to Gaffney's.—
Saw White there in the affray. Saw some men have
hold of him, shoving him out of doors. Three or four
men had hold of White. Didn't see Lemuel Starke
there. Don't know whether the men who put White
out belonged to Gaffney's party. About half a dozen
men came out. Don't know who was outside when they
put White out. Don't know what became of White af-
ter they put him out. I stood on the walk with the
watchman. Did not see White again afterward.
   Ques. By Whiting.—What did you see further.
   Objected to by Graham as irrelevant.
   Objection overruled by the court.
   Witness continued. The watchman then rapped, and
I went home. I stood there in all about ten minutes.
During the ten minutes while I stood on the walk, I saw
nothing but a scuffle on the walk. Did not attempt to
assist White. They put him out of the Willett street
door. I was standing toward Grand street. White
went toward Broome street. Did not see White go in
again. Did not see any one go in. <u>Did'nt</u> take particu-
lar notice. <u>Did'nt</u> see Fitzpatrick or Gaffney—<u>dont</u>
know either of them. <u>Dont</u> know why the watchman
rapped. Joseph Starke was standing with me. At the
time—think that about half a dozen persons were stand-
ing with me on the walk—Joseph Starke was there—
<u>dont</u> know that Samuel Starke was there. <u>Did'nt</u> hear
that any one was stabbed. <u>Did'nt</u> see any one fall on
the watchman; saw no blows struck; <u>did'nt</u> see White
have any knife that night; <u>did'nt</u> see a meat block in-
side the door. When the watchman rapped went away,
because I <u>did'nt</u> want to get into any scrape. <u>Did'nt</u>
see White afterwards. I worked for Justine Fountain
then. I now work up the river. <u>Did'nt</u> converse with
White at the oyster house. White had on a black coat,
and black hat and pantaloons.
   Alfred Pierce.—I resided 18 Cannon street on the
night of the affray. I saw White at Frost's oyster house
between 1 and 2 o'clock, did not converse with him.
Went with the Starkes, Timpson, <u title="Pelzer (elsewhere)">Pelser</u>, and Hall to
the corner of Willett and Broome. All but myself
went into Gaffney's. While they were in White came
there. Lemuel Starke came with White. They went
in. Soon as White went in two men caught him by the
throat. White had been in about two minutes when the
men took hold of him, heard no dispute between him
and the men. The men were pulling White about and
Starke went in and separated them. Timpson went into
the back room. Didn't see any thing in White's hand.
There was a crowd inside. Don't know how many.
White opened the door several times, and as he opened
the door he made a thrust, each time with his right
hand. Could see the persons inside when the door was
opened. The door was opened and closed three times.
When the watchman rapped saw two other watchmen
come up—they come up from toward Delancey street.
   Dr. Charles Fitzpatrick was called in shortly after
the affray. Saw the body of deceased. Found another
physician had arrived there before me, and did nothing
more than lay my hand on the body, which I found quite
cold. The pulse had entirely ceased. Found a wound
on the right groin. It appeared to have been given by
a sharp instrument. Could not tell whether he had
bled much. He had been washed and was as cold as
ice. The femoral artery had been punctured. I ex-
amined the wound upon <u title="Denman (elsewhere)">Denham</u>, it was upon the right
temple. It appeared to be a clean cut.
   This witness was cross-examined, but nothing new
was elicited.
   Dr. Walter <u title="Payley (elsewhere)">Pugsley</u>—Was called to see Fitzpatrick
after he was stabbed. Found a deep wound on the
right groin, which had penetrated the main artery. The
wound was about three-fourths of an inch wide. I
probed it with my finger, and it about 3 inches deep. He
was much <u title="exhausted">exhaused</u>, and but just alive. The blood had
ceased flowing. Sometimes the blood will cease flow-
ing before the supply is entirely exhausted. Have no
doubt that the wound caused his death. In this case
the <u title="hemorrhage">hemorrage</u> was stopped from the contraction of the
vessels.
   Dr. S. C. Ellis.—Was present at the post mortem ex-
amination on Fitzpatrick's body. Found a wound in the
right groin. The wound ran <u title="transversely">transeversely</u> across the
body. At first view of the external wound, we thought
that some of the internal minor vessels were wounded.
The examination was conducted by Drs. Cadwell, Tap-
pen and myself. The femoral vein we found had been
nearly severed. The vein when distended with blood,
is almost the size of one's little finger. There was
coagulated blood both within and outside the wound.
The severing of this vein does not necessarily produce
death; but would do so if not seasonably attended to.
   From the appearance of the wound the man might
have lived an hour after the infliction of the wound. The
first duty of a surgeon, on finding such a wound, should
be to apply a heavy pressure upon the artery. So long
as the man breathed, if his blood was not entirely ex-
hausted, there is a probability that his life might be sa-
ved. Deceased was a stout man, about 5 feet 6 or 7
inches high. In a case of this kind, so long as there is
life there is a possibility of restoring the person wound-
ed, and we never cease to apply remedies. My first
course would be to apply a pressure to the artery, and
give stimulants.
   William <u title="Hale (elsewhere)">Hales</u>.—Am a painter by trade, and 20 years
of age. On the 13th of February last, I lived at No. 22
Cannon street. I know Ezra White—have been a school
fellow with him. On the night of the affray I was with
him at Frost's, but not at Gaffney's. He left Frost's in
company with Lemuel Starke, a few minutes before I
did. At Gaffney's I saw a great number of people in the
back room. I saw J. Starke, <u>Peltzer</u> and Timpson—
where White was at that time I know not. I was in the
back room some few minutes, and hearing a scuffle in
front, I went out. Saw White, and others trying to put
him out. The landlord said, “young men, I'm astonish-
ed at you.” This he said on the outside of the door,
and saying nothing more he went in and closed the door.
Saw White go to the <u title="Willett">Willet</u> street door, open it, and
strike his hand in. Did not see inside the door. Saw
nothing in his hand. First saw the watchman when he
rapped. White then went up <u title="Willett">Willet</u> street at a very
fast walk. I went up Broome street, but did not see
White. White seemed much excited and mad when he
opened the door. When the men put White out they
came out upon the stoop. They came out again upon
the walk—don't know who opened the door. They came
out toward White, within two feet of him. The land-
lord then came out and put them all in again, and closed
the door—then it was that White opened the door and
made the thrusts. Heard no one call the watch. Did
not see White have a knife. Had not for some years
been much in company with White before this night.
   [Here the testimony is but a repetition of that given
by preceding witnesses.]
   At the conclusion of this witness's testimony the Court
adjourned to 10 o'clock this morning.

   <b>CONVICTION OF WHITE, THE MURDERER.</b>
—<i>Before the Court of Oyer and Terminer, yesterday, Judge
Inglis presiding</i>.—It is rare, very rare, that our citizens
are called upon to witness scenes of such overwhelming
excitement, as have occurred at the City Hall, daily,
during the past week.
   It has been an occasion of peculiar interest to every
lover of good order, and the well being of society. The
“observed of all observers,” the prisoner at the bar, is
a young man, just blooming into manhood, some twenty-
two years of age, of an unusually prepossessing appear-
ance—clad in a most tasteful and elegant apparel, and in
every way calculated, so far as his exterior is concern-
ed, to win the pity and excite the sympathy of the casual
observer.
   Fixing the criminal as the centre of the scene, the
outline, as delineated throughout the trial, is in charac-
ter no less imposing and interesting. On his left hand
sits his brother, apparently of an age co-equal with his
own. On his right, his junior counsel, too apparently
green in years, and next, the associate counsel, the father
of the former, but yet, to all appearance, in the prime of
life, and possessing all the vigor of intellect, with a three
fold store of experience and intelligence.
   Directly in front of the prisoner, and between him and
the bench, sits the prosecuting officer, the advocate of
the People, the representative and defender of their
rights; and in a more elevated position in front, and
above all, sits the stern minister of justice, the presiding
Judge, supported on either hand by a City Magistrate,
of lesser grade and power.
   The back ground, the entire area of the spacious hall,
is filled with a dense crowd of eager and anxious spec-
tators, composed mostly, of what? of a class, we will not
say guilty, but unfortunately, nearly all the associates and
friends of the poor wretch who is about to offer up his
life a sacrifice on the altar of offended justice. But
enough of the scene, we have before described it, and
in no one particular did it vary yesterday, from what
has been presented during the whole trial, excepting
that the crowd was greatly increased in numbers, and
an eagerness, amounting almost to frenzy, prevailed
throughout the day.
   Never, certainly, was a prisoner more ably defended.
Not a stone has been left unturned—not a particle of
testimony, which could by any possibility be perverted
so as to tell in the prisoner's favor, but has been spread
in its most magnified form before the jury. In the dis-
play of ability and legal acumen, for which the junior
counsel, D. Graham, Jr., is so remarkable, he has even
surpassed himself, and the distinguished reputation of
the elder Graham has lost nothing in public estimation
by the extraordinary effort made by him on the present
occasion. Indeed, so completely were the audience
carried away by the force of his argument, and the pow-
er of his eloquence, that at the conclusion of his address
to the jury, the court room resounded with the plaudits
of the assembled multitude, and notwithstanding the
solemnity of the occasion. It was long before the offi-
cers could procure a due observance of order and regu-
larity.
   On the part of the prosecution the case has been con-
ducted by the District Attorney, Mr. Whiting, with an
ability never surpassed, if ever equalled in the history
of the criminal jurisprudence of our city.
   On the opening of the Court yesterday morning at 10
o'clock, his honor Judge Inglis, commenced his charge
to the jury. He <u title="recapitulated">recapulated</u> with the greatest preci-
sion and minuteness, the whole of the testimony in the
case, and as he progressed, cited all the law and autho-
rities, applicable to each particular portion as it had re-
ference to the subject matter at issue. The extraordi-
nary ability displayed by this magistrate, considering his
comparative lack of experience, in the duties incidental
to the elevated station he has been called to occupy, has
excited the astonishment and admiration of all his for-
mer associates at the bar, and drawn from our citizens
generally, a degree of respect, to which he is eminently
entitled.
   His Honor closed his charge to the jury at quarter be-
fore 2 o'clock, when after some few remarks from the
prisoner's counsel, they retired to deliberate upon a
verdict.
   The jury remained absent till 6 o'clock last evening,
when it was announced that they had agreed upon a
verdict. The Court then came in, and at the same mo-
ment the Hall was again filled with spectators.
   The Prisoner was called upon to stand up and look
upon the jury, and as the foreman, amid the death-like
stillness which reigned around, pronounced the awful
words “<i>Guilty of Wilful Murder!</i>” he stood before
them with an unblanched cheek—not a muscle of his
countenance was seen to move, but throughout the
heart-sickening scene, which drew tears from the eyes
of even many of the veteran officers around him, he
maintained during the dreadful moment the same stoical
indifference of feeling he has manifested throughout the
whole trial.
   Those who have attended the trial throughout, and
heard the testimony on either side, cannot but acknow-
ledge that it is “righteous judgment,” and a rendition
of ample justice both to the accused and to the commu-
nity at large.
   An immense crowd were within and about the City
Hall, to witness the removal of the prisoner to the Halls
of Justice; and it was feared at one time from their
movements that an attempt would be made to rescue
White from the hands of the officers. By a skillful ma-
noeuvre of Mr. Sheriff Acker and Deputy Lowndes, the
removal was happily effected without difficulty or dis-
turbance, and even without the knowledge of most of
the people present. The prisoner was taken into a car-
riage from the western basement entrance of the Hall,
and conducted through the Centre street gate to the pri-
son yard, and all effected in safety before the crowd had
time to reach the spot. White will be brought up for
sentence on the last day of the term of the Court, proba-
bly on Wednesday of next week.

Yesterday morning, at the Court of Oyer and
Terminer, Judge Inglis presiding, the jury were
charged, and afterwards retired to consider their
verdict. At 5 P. M. they returned, having found
the prisoner guilty of <small>WILFUL MURDER</small>.
	...
crowd in the Court room, and about the Hall, was
very great, and some fears were entertained that
a rescue might be attempted. By the judicious ar-
rangements of Mr. Acker, the Sheriff, the prisoner
was removed without any difficulty or disturbance,
and was immediately taken to the Centre street
prison, whence he will be brought to receive his
sentence probably on Wednesday next.

   T<small>RIAL FOR</small> M<small>URDER</small>.—The following brief
analysis of the trial of Ezra White, for the murder
of Peter Fitzpatrick, which occupied the Court of
Oyer and Terminer from the 10th to the 16th in-
stant, and caused great excitement, is from the
Journal of Commerce.
   “On the night of the 13th of February last, a
man named Lawrence Gaffney, who had recently
commenced keeping a public house in Broome
street, invited some friends to a house-warming.
About 3 o'clock in the morning, while his company
were dancing and amusing themselves, the prison-
er and three other young men went into the house
uninvited, and two of them walked into a back
room, where the greater part of Gaffney's friends
were. The prisoner had scarcely entered the
house when one of Gaffney's friends suggested to
the prisoner and his friends that they were in-
truding, and the prisoner replied, “I came here
to make a muss, and I'll go when I d——n please.”
   Gaffney, who was then standing behind his coun-
ter, feared an affray would take place between the
parties, and came from behind the counter with
the intention of interposing between them. Al-
most at the same moment the prisoner made a
push at one of Gaffney's party, named McLany,
and the latter pushed at him. Gaffney then rush-
ed between them, and seized hold of the prisoner,
and pushed him out of the house, and some per-
son outside, supposed to be a watchman, closed the
door, which opened into the street. The prisoner
immediately pushed the door partly open again,
and thrust in his hand with a knife in it, as if in
the act of stabbing at some person. The door
was again closed by a person inside, and again
partly pushed open by the prisoner, who repeated
the same <u title="manoeuvre">manœuvre</u> with his hand. In a moment
or two after, the door was opened by some
person inside, and one of Gaffney's party, named
Fitzpatrick, stepped out on the stoop, and was in-
stantly stabbed by the prisoner, in the groin, and
fell to the ground mortally wounded, and died
shortly after. The prisoner and his companions
then ran away; and the ensuing day, the prisoner
and one of his companions of the night before, fled
from this city in the steamboat to Boston, from
whence they intended to go to Charleston, but
were pursued by the police, and arrested at Bos-
ton, and brought back to New York.
   There was a good deal of contradictory evi-
dence as to the description of clothes worn by the
prisoner on the night of the murder, and as to
whether he had or had not been roughly treated
by some of Gaffney's friends, not including Fitzpa-
trick, before he was put out of the house. But
the evidence showed most indisputably that the
prisoner had killed the deceased, in the manner
we have described, and the only question which
admitted of any doubt, was, as to what was the
legal degree of crime which the homicide amount-
ed to.
   Judge Inglis, in a charge of more than three
hours length, minutely summed up the evidence,
and with great perspicuity pointed out the different
circumstances which rendered homicide murder or
manslaughter in its different degrees.
   Counsel for the prisoner took several exceptions
to his honor's charge.
   The jury retired, and after an absence of near-
ly four hours, brought in a verdict of “wilful mur-
der.”

   <i>Death from Oil of <u title="Tansy">Tanzy</u>.—Caution to Females</i>.—On
Sunday afternoon a colored female, named Tuttle, aged
23, a servant in the family of John Sevens of 117 Wal-
ker street, procured an ounce of oil of <u title="tansy">tanzy</u>, which she
attempted to administer to herself, for the purpose of
producing abortion. About 12 o'clock she retired to
her room and took nearly one half of the contents of the
phial. She was immediately thrown into the most dread-
ful paroxysms, and though medical aid was called in,
and every remedy adopted for her relief, she survived
less than one hour. The coroner's jury, which was
called yesterday to view the body, rendered a verdict
in accordance with the above facts.

	SUPREME COURT OF NEW YORK.
		(Sitting at Albany.)
   Ezra White, <i>ads.</i> The People, &c.—The defendant in
this case was convicted of the murder of Peter Fitzpat-
rick, in the Court of Oyer and Terminer in this city in
June last. He was last week removed to Albany, to be
heard by counsel, on a motion for a new trial. The bill
of exceptions set forth that the convictions were illegal.
1st, that the Judge (Inglis) who presided at the trial was
not empowered by the statute to preside in courts of
criminal jurisprudence, and 2d, that the indictment un-
der which the defendant was tried, was defective in ha-
ving therein but one count and not setting forth distinc-
tively the allegations as required by the statute.
   The case was eloquently and ably argued, and at
great length, by Messrs. D. Graham, of this city, and S.
Stephens, of Albany; and for the prosecution, by J. R.
Whitney, Esq., District Attorney.
   The court, on Thursday morning, delivered a long
opinion, confirming the Judgement of the Court of Oyer
and Terminer.
   The prisoner, in custody of the keeper, Mr. Hyde,
and officer Staunton, returned to the city yesterday, and
was committed to the city prison, where he now awaits
the sentence of death.
   Mr. Stephens gave notice to the Court that an appeal
would be made to the Court of Errors for a reversion
of the decision.

		<m8>Reported for the Courier & Enquirer.</m8>
   <i>Sentence of White</i>.—In the Court of Oyer and Termi-
ner, on Saturday, Judge Inglis <s>p??????????????</s> to
previous appointment, Ezra White <s>convicted</s> of the
murder of Peter Fitzpatrick, was put to the bar for sen-
tence. The prisoner throughout preserved the most
stoical indifference to the thrilling scene which was pass-
ing around him, and at times, when almost every indivi-
dual of the assembled crowd was moved to tears, the
prisoner retained the same fixedness of countenance,
and to all appearances was, of all present, the least af-
fected.
   On being asked if he had any thing to say why judg-
ment should not be pronounced upon him, he simply re-
plied, “I will leave all that to my counsel.”
   David Graham, Esq. said that he had nothing to in-
terpose in the way of Sentence of <i>Death</i> being pro-
nounced, but that he was prepared with a Bill of Ex-
ceptions, on which to carry the case up to the Court of
Errors, which he wished to have put upon the files of
the Court.
   His Honor, previous to pronouncing the awful sen-
tence of the law, addressed with much feeling the
wretched culprit. He recapitulated with great minute-
ness all the circumstances which took place on the night
of the murder. On the trial, which was an unusually
protracted one, the prisoner, he said, had enjoyed every
possible advantage of proving himself innocent. His
counsel, the most able and zealous that could have been
selected, have argued to the jury every argument which
their learning could draw from the law, or their inge-
nuity could extort from the facts of the case. The Jury,
after a most patient investigation, and after having been
kept together a much longer time then they themselves
deemed necessary, without a voice of dissent, agreed up-
on a verdict of <i>Guilty</i>, which verdict was clearly a just
and righteous one, and one in which the whole public
would finally concur. His Honor alluded to the apparent
immobility of the prisoner, (which he preserved through-
out the trying scene) and remarked that was perhaps
less necessary for the <u title="prisoner's">prisoners</u> sake than for that of
his companions about him, that he should allude to the
awful doom which awaited the transgressor of the law.
He informed the prisoner, that though application would
be made in his behalf to a higher tribunal, yet from this
source he could have but little to hope. As a last re-
sort, an appeal might be made for clemency of the Ex-
ecutive; but he would put it to the prisoner himself, if
the circumstances of the case would entitle him to the
merit of a pardon from the Governor. There was then
in all human probability, for him no hope, and he would
therefore commend him to self reflection, and to sue for
pardon to that Tribunal before which he must shortly ap-
pear. His honor then pronounced the sentence, that the
prisoner be taken to the prison from which he came,
and thence, on the 16th of January next, be taken to the
place of execution, and there to be hanged by the neck
till he was <i>dead</i>.
   The prisoner was then remanded, and the court ad-
journed.

   <i>Sudden Death</i>.—The Coroner called yesterday, to
hold an inquest at 208 Elizabeth street, on the body of
John <u title="Dwyer (in American)">Duryea</u>, a native of Tipperary, Ireland, <u title="43 (in American)">48</u> years
of age. It appeared that deceased was a pill maker, in
the employ of Dr. Evans, of Chatham street. He lived
in the upper part of a house occupied by Michael Mc
Dermot. He had been complaining more or less for a
month past—during which time he has done no work.—
On Monday evening he came down into McDermot's
shop, and sat by the stove till 10 o'clock, when he went
up stairs to go to his room, and when on reaching the
landing he fell down, and almost instantly expired. In
his pocket was found a certificate of membership, of
Lodge No. 1404 of Royal Orange Association, dated
October 1823. He had several children living but no
wife. Verdict death by visitation of God.

<u title="Duryea (in Courier)">Dwyer</u>, a native of Ireland, aged <u title="48 (in Courier)">43</u> years, died
very suddenly yesterday, at No. 208 Elizabeth
street. From the testimony of Mrs. Dermot, with
whom he boarded, it appears the deceased had been
sick some time. He had been in the employ of
Dr. Evans, of Chatham street. On Monday even-
ing he said, “I am going to bed,” and went up
stairs for that purpose. He was soon after heard
to fall.
   Mrs. Smith deposed that she heard the deceased
fall down stairs. She took a light and went to him.
He was lying at the bottom of the stairs. He said,
“I am going to die, pray put me to bed.” The
deceased was put to bed. His clothes were taken
off. He did not live five minutes afterwards. The

   The death of Armstrong, the rioter, on New
Year's eve, and his reputed connection with the
gang of which <i>Ezra White</i>, now lying under sen-
tence of death for murder, was connected, has led
to some inquiry into the circumstances under which
this latter was recently reprieved by the Governor
until the Court for the Correction of Errors shall
determine upon the validity of exceptions taken in
his behalf.
   We believe these facts are as follows: The
Court of <i>Oyer and Terminer</i>, at which White was
tried, was held by Judge Edwards and his associate
Judge Inglis. Early in the trial Judge Edwards,
for good cause, left the bench, and the proceedings
was carried on and closed before Judge Inglis, by
whom sentence of death was pronounced upon
White. The counsel for the convict have except-
ed to the legality of the trial and condemnation,
on the ground that, by the statute, none but a Cir-
cuit Judge, or <i>first</i> Judge of the County, can hold
the <i>Oyer and Terminer</i>; and although subsequent
legislation has given both to the Circuit Judge and
to the First Judge an assistant, and to these as-
sistants, as is believed, equal power with the prin-
cipals; yet, inasmuch as counsel learned in the
law contend that this is a doubtful construction, and
that if no such equality of power be given, then the
trial before Judge Inglis is null—it seemed incum-
bent on the Governor, in a matter of life and death,
to afford the convict the opportunity of carrying
the exception up to the higher courts.
   We understand that the Supreme Court have
affirmed the validity of the trial. A farther ap-
peal has been taken to the Court of Errors. If
they shall confirm the decision below, the law
will take its course, and the convict be executed.
If they should reverse it, the result will be—not
the liberation or pardon of the murdered—but a
new trial, before a competent Court.
   We have been thus particular, because it is, we
think, no part of the character of Governor Seward,
to interpose the prerogative of pardon between the
law and guilt so clear as that established on the
trial against White; and because the recent out-
rages of the same lawless ruffians with whom he
was an associate, would seem to show that the
hope of the possible eventual escape of their old
comrade after condemnation, has rather embolden-
ed, than restrained, their excesses.
   Thus far the sole action in this matter of the
Executive has been to afford time for the solution
of a legal doubt, which touches in no degree the
guilt or innocence of he accused, and furnishes no
ground, in any event, for eventual pardon.

   T<small>HE</small> P<small>ARDONING</small> P<small>OWER</small>.—The Buffalo papers
contain a correspondence between Gov. <i>Seward</i>
and some gentlemen of that city, in reference to a
petition, very numerously signed, for the pardon of
<i>Benj. Rathbun</i>. The prayer of this petition the
Governor very wisely and properly rejects, closing
a well reasoned letter on the subject, with this just
sentiment:
<l9>   His conviction was necessary to maintain the
sway of the laws, and rights of citizens, and to vin-
dicate the dignity and honor of the State. I re-
luctantly add that it seems to be a case in which
the effect of that conviction <u title="must not be (elsewhere)">must be</u> impaired by
the exercise of Executive clemency.

   Mary Rogers, a white woman, was accused of
whipping a negro wench named Dolly Phillips.
Mary said that Dolly insulted her over so much,
and called her unproper words.
   To this Dolly rejoined that she <u>did'nt</u> want Mary
to come to her place, and then Mary rejoined that
Dolly had no place, but staid with her cousin's mo-

her to the tombs for twenty days.

<m9><cl>T</cl>O THE LADIES—It will be remembered that it is
about four years since Dr. Vandenburgh's Female
Renovating Pills, which have acquired a well deserved
celebrity for their excellent effects, were first introduced
into this country by Mrs. Bird, the celebrated midwife
and female physician; since that, however, several at-
tempts have been made to imitate this medicine; the
consequences of which, are misery and suffering to the
misguided individuals who are deceived by these un-
principled pretenders who are daily palming their spu-
rious specifics upon the community. Mrs. Bird would
remark that many cases have come to her notice where
the constitution of the patient has been materially in-
jured. Mrs. B. apprises females that she has received
a thorough medical education—has obtained her diplo-
ma from the medical college, Gottingen, Germany; and
her long experience in the treatment of all female com-
plaints well qualifies her for the task of imparting health,
vigor, and consequently happiness, to all those who may
honor her with their confidence. Residence of Mrs.
Bird, 18 Oliver st., where she is prepared to accommo-
date ladies on the point of confinement, and to adminis-
ter medicines for all diseases to which her sex is liable.

tained of Mrs. Bird, Dr. McClaurey, 136 Walker st., and

<m9>   CAUTION—SPURIOUS FEMALE MONTHLY
PILLS—Owing to the great celebrity, efficacy, and suc-
cess of Madame Restell's Female Monthly Pills, in all
cases of irregularity, suppression, &c, &c, and their ac-
knowledged adaptation to the complaints of the female
frame, attempts are continually made by ignorant and
unprincipled persons, by calling their miserable com-
pounds “Female Monthly Pills,” to impose upon the
public. Madame Restell deems it necessary to state that
her genuine “Female Monthly Pills,” can be obtained
only at her offices in New York, Philadelphia and Boston,
and agents mentioned in her advertisement on the last
column of the last page. All others are base imitations.
Madame Restell's celebrated “Powders,” for married la-
dies in delicate health, can be obtained only at her offices

<m9>   ☞ TO FEMALES—BEWARE OF IMPOSITION
—Since the introduction of Madame Restell's Celebrated
Female Monthly Pills into the United States, some two
years since, such has been their success in all cases of
suppression, irregularity, stoppage, &c, that they have
altogether superseded the various useless and injurious
compounds, thrust upon the public by designing pretend-
ers, who, finding their miserable and injurious com-
pounds unsaleable as “Female Renovating Pills,” im-
pudently seek to deceive the public by calling them “Fe-
male Monthly Pills,” and under cover of the high repute
of Madame Restell's Female Monthly Pills, imagine to
find sale for their deleterious compositions. This con-
temptible trick has not even the merit of originality.—
Some four or five previous attempts of this kind, to de-
ceive the public, have been already made by unprinci-
pled individuals, to gain a few dollars, causing not only
a loss of money, but sacrifice of health to the unwary.
Madame Restell feels herself under the more obligation
to caution females against these attempts at imposition,
as besides the loss of their money, highly detrimental
effects for life ensue. That imposters should have been
anxious, from time to time, to avail themselves of the
celebrity attained by Madame Restell's Female Monthly
<u>Pill</u>, is not a matter of surprise, since such is their repu-
tation, that she has been under the necessity of opening
offices in Boston, No. 7 Essex st., Philadelphia, No. 3
South Seventh st., as well as the principal office, 148
Greenwich st., New York, besides appointing agents for
their sale in this city, as mentioned in Madame Restell's
advertisements. All Female Monthly Pills, except those
sold at Madame Restell's offices, or her advertised
agents, are bare and miserable imitations. Females
will judge of the shallow pretensions of the individual
who is under the necessity of making use of the celebrity
acquired by others to be brought into notice.<!-- Some text is better seen in file 0280. -->

<m9>LEGAL INJUSTICE! EFFECTS OF <u title="PERSECUTION">PERECU-</u>
			TION!
   MADAME RESTELL'S promise to give the facts
connected with the prosecution—it may with justice be
called persecution—commenced some sixteen months
since, and has just terminated—against her—with such re-
marks as have suggested themselves, is presented to the
public; the more especially as the course pursued by a
portion of the press has been far from honorable, from
which it may also be learned how much injustice can be
perpetrated under the sanction of legal, doubtless perfect-
ly legal, forms.
   The facts are simply these: In July, 1839, a female
having heard of the great reputation and success of Ma-
dame Restell's specifics for suppression, irregularity, &c.
finding herself irregular, called to obtain a box of “Fe-
male Monthly Pills” at the office; being a foreigner it
was difficult for her to made herself intelligible, but
she was understood to say that she was subject to irreg-
ularity, &c. In the course of conversation she was
informed that if she was married, she must not under
peculiar circumstances, mentioned in the directions,
make use of them. She purchased a box and took it
home. In the latter end of August, it appears, she en-
tered a complaint against a young man—in the course
of her examination, she stated that she purchased a box
of pills, but declared under oath “that she had never
used a single one.” In February, 1840, she went to the
Bellevue Hospital, and was there delivered of two living
children, where she expired on the following March, of
child-bed, or puerperal fever. Here, then, are the facts
which have led to the prosecution and subsequent honor-
able discharge, without trial, of Madame Restell. Such
was the material upon which a prosecution was com-
menced. The flimsiness and injustice of the prosecution
covered the instigators with ridicule and shame, and re-
sulted, after a procrastination of sixteen months, as
every person of the least common sense would have pre-
dicted, in a “nolle prosequi” being entered.
   The instigators and chief actors in the prosecution
may or may not have been influenced by upright, honor-
able, or praiseworthy motives; it is not for Madame
Restell to judge of the purity of their intention. They
may honestly imagine that the introduction of Madame
Restell's medicines may lead to immorality, vice, &c.,
but admitting all this, it is scarcely sufficient to justify
them in acts of gross injustice, oppression, and persecu-
tion, under cover of technicalities; but when it is con-
sidered what a frightful train of diseases have their ori-
gin in irregularity, suppression, &c., and the many weak-
ly married women whose lives were despaired of have
become healthy by the adoption of Madame Restell's
celebrated Powders, is not the discovery of Madame
Restell's specifics one of the greatest blessings? and is it
not in the highest degree unjust to intimate that wives,
sisters, and mothers want but the opportunity to be vi-
cious. Shame on him who can entertain such a state-
ment.
   Strange it is, that the lessons of experience should be
lost upon men. When has persecution retarded the pro-
gress of a truth in religion, science or morals? Never.—
It always has, and always will but accelerate with ten-
fold velocity, the advance of the object of persecution,
which, without it, would have only crawled with snail-
like pace, aided by persecution, is immediately possessed
of the impulse of electricity. Thus has it been with Ma-
dame Restell's celebrated medicines—the celebrity they
had for many years enjoyed in Europe, was gradually
gaining ground in the United States, and it would have
taken years to have given them the reputation and celeb-
rity which a few months sufficed by the agency of perse-
cution. They are now known and appreciated far and
wide throughout this country, to the exclusion almost of
all others. So much for persecution. MADAME RES-

<m9><cl>M</cl>ADAME RESTELL'S FEMALE MONTHLY PILLS
 —Madame Restell, Female Physician, has had ample evi-
dence to satisfy her that many of the complaints to which fe-
males are subject, have been principally, if not wholly, owing
to the absence, heretofore, of any proper, safe, efficient, and
certain medicine in cases of suppression, irregularity and stop-
page of those functions of nature upon which the health, and
even the life of every female depends. Delicacy and propriety
forbidding the freedom of unreservedness, except to one of their
own sex, as to the particular effects experienced, without a
knowledge of which it is wholly impossible to form a combi-
nation of ingredients affording relief, as well as the repugnance
of adverting to the subject unless to a female, has, no doubt,
been the chief cause of the want of success of the various
specifics introduced by the medical fraternity. The introduc-
tion of the Female Monthly Pills has removed the source of a
truly frightful mount of misery, as being the only efficacious
remedy known in Europe for the last thirty years, having been
used and first introduced by Madame Restell, the celebrated
Midwife and Female Physician, (grandmother of the adverti-
ser,) with the most unexampled success. Madame Restell, as
well from her perfect acquaintance with the peculiar physiolo-
gy and anatomy of the female frame, as the opportunities af-
forded her in discovering every, the minutest sensation and ef-
fect produced by the use of her Female Monthly Pills has been
enabled so to combine the ingredients of which they are com-
posed, as at once to unite mildness and safety with almost cer-
tain efficacy. The advantages afforded of consulting freely
and unreservedly (without cost) with one of their own sex,
conversant with their dispositions, will be manifest to every
reflecting female, and will save much useless expenditure. It
is to be hoped that the mothers of females just emerging into
womanhood, as they value the future welfare and happiness of
their daughters, or their own peace, will snatch them from the
herd of evils arising from this cause. The most obstinate and
long-seated cases of irregularity, suppression, &c., have been
removed by the female Monthly Pills.
   It is necessary for the married to abstain from their use for
reasons that are contained in the full and particular directions
when and how to be used, which accompany each box.
   Madame Restell's proper signature is written on the cover of
each box. Price $1. For sale at

<m9><cl>I</cl>MPORTANT TO MARRIED FEMALES.—MADAME
 RESTELL'S PREVENTIVE POWDERS.—These in-
valuable Powders have been universally adopted in Europe,
but France in particular, for upwards of thirty years, as well
as by thousands in this country, as being the only mild, safe,
and efficacious remedy for married ladies whose health forbids
a too rapid increase of family.
   Madame Restell, as is well known, was for thirty years Fe-
male Physician in the two principal Female Hospitals in Eu-
rope—those of Vienna and Paris—where, favored by her great
experience and opportunities, she attained that celebrity in
those great discoveries in medical science so specially adapted
to the female frame, for which her medicines now stand unri-
valled, as well in this country as in Europe. Her acquaintance
with the physiology and anatomy of the female frame, enabled
her to arrive at a knowledge of the primary causes of female
indispositions—especially of married females—which, in 1808,
led to the discovery of her celebrated “Preventive Powders.”
Their adoption has been the means of preserving not only the
health, but even the life of many an affectionate wife and fond
mother.
   The advertiser feeling the importance of this subject, and es-
timating the vast benefits resulting to thousands by their adop-
tion, would respectfully arouse the attention of the married, by
all that they hold near and dear, to its consideration. Is it not
wise and virtuous to prevent evils to which we are subject, by
simple and healthy means within our control? Every dispas-
sionate, virtuous, and enlightened mind will unhesitatingly an-
swer in the affirmative. This is all that Madame Restell re-
commends or ever recommended. Price Five Dollars a pack-
age, accompanied with full and particular directions. They

   A D<small>OMESTIC</small> T<small>RAGEDY</small>—M<small>URDER MOST FOUL SUS-
PECTED</small>.—Some months since, there resided and kept
a dry goods store in Greenwich, near Vesey street, a
merchant of the name of William <u title="Morrill (below)">Murrell</u>, who was
in very flourishing circumstances, with good pros-
pects before him, and blessed—as he thought—with
a young and lovely wife, who had one daughter. This
gentleman became smitten with the mania for mak-
ing a fortune rapidly, and sold out his dry goods
store, for the purpose of pursuing other plans for the
furtherance of his wishes at the south. He left his
wife and daughter here, with a large proportion of
his property, intending to return to, or send for them
at his convenience. After his departure, the lady
formed other plans of her own, which greatly alarm-
ed the family of her husband, and in particular was she
cautioned by them against the keeping company with
and promenading Broadway, along with some tall,
dark cavalier, whose name none of her husband's
family was acquainted with. The lady, however,
had a liking for her constant visiter, and determined
not to be thwarted. About three weeks since, an
universal bustle was observed in her department, and
great preparations for packing up, and the following
day several cart loads of valuable moveables were
shipped by her directions, on board one of the pack-
ets that made between this city and the port of Bal-
timore. In the same vessel also embarked the lady,
the tall cavalier, and Mr. <u>Murrell</u>'s daughter.
   Information of these interesting matters was im-
mediately forwared to Mr. <u>Murrell</u> by letter, and he
lost no time ere he bent his steps towards Baltimore,
there to await the arrival of the vessel, taking the
precaution to put on a pair of green spectacles, so as
to be sure he had got hold of the right party before
his faithless wife could have time to give her para-
mour the alarm. When the packet arrived in Balti-
more, Mr. <u>Murrell</u> notified the Captain of the state
of affairs, and cautioned him against giving up any
of the property which had been brought on board
by Mrs. <u>Murrell</u>. He then procured a police officer,
and had that lady's tall and gallant protector taken
into custody, on charge of stealing. These prompt
proceedings alarmed Mrs. <u>Murrell</u>, and she in-
duced her husband to consent to return with her
to this city, and leave her friend to the mercy of the
law. It is supposed that he consented to some such
arrangement, for a letter was received by his friend in
New York announcing their return, and directing
that some furnished apartments should be imme-
diately got for their reception. The appointed day
passed, and the next, but last week the lady and her
daughter returned with the corpse of the late Mr.
<u>Murrell</u>, which she said she had brought here at his
earnest request, in order that it might be buried in the
vault of his family at Port Richmond, Staten Island.
On Wednesday the funeral was to take place, but
when they came to the grave the body had no certifi-
cate from a medical man, which the law requires;
and as the sexton refused to receive the body without
the coroner of that county was sent for. The lady
then represented that the body had been many days
travelling, and that decomposition must have com-
menced, which fact might make it very unpleasant to
have in examination. However it was the general
wish, and the coffin was opened, when the body of
the dead man appeared quite fresh, and appeared to
be only discolored in two places, under the ear and
around the stomach. The coroner not deeming the
circumstances to be suspicious, permitted the fune-
ral ceremony to be performed, and the earth closed,
as it was supposed for ever, over the coffin.
   That night the lady and her daughter staid with the
family of her husband at Staten Island, and of course
the sudden bereavement of the disconsolate widow
was the principal topic of conversation. Mrs. <u>Mur-
rell</u> told different stories of her late husband's last mo-
ments to different people, and one of the relations of the
deceased elicited from the daughter that her mother
had <i>poisoned her father</i>, and was going to return to Bal-
timore to marry the other gentleman. This man went
again to the Coroner, and the body was exhumed, the
stomach, duodenum and other intestines taken out and
brought to this city on Saturday, and delivered to Dr.
Chilton, the eminent chemist, of Broadway, for analy-
zation. The investigation has not yet commenced
and therefore, we cannot give the result at present, but
we understand that there are many circumstances be-
sides the confession of the girl, which seem to
strengthen the suspicion of poisoning. A final inves-
tigation will be held in a day or two, and we shall give
the proceedings thereof; but the strangest part of the
affair is the fact, that the lady and the child have
been permitted to return to Baltimore.

<b>☞</b> BRAZEN ATTEMPT AT IMPOSITION. <b class="r180" title="☜">☞</b></f12>
		<i>CAUTION TO MARRIED LADIES,
	AND TO THOSE ABOUT TO BE MARRIED.</i>
<m9><cl>A</cl>S attempts are made by desperate mercenary, and unprinci-
pled persons to practice a base imposition upon married
ladies and those about to be married, Madame Restell feels
called upon to expose the infamous means by which it is attempt-
ed to be consummated. Some three years since, it may be well
known to all, Madame Restell's celebrated “Preventive Pow-
ders,” (for married ladies, whose delicate or precarious state of
health being such as to forbid a too rapid increase of family,)
were first introduced into this country, and elicited some stric-
tures from the press, as to the propriety and moral tendency of
their introduction. Their perfect safety, efficacy, healthiness,
and certainty, however, having been the means of preserving
the life of many an affectionate wife, unable, or for a time in-
capable, of giving birth to children, was a consideration of pa-
ramount importance, worthy the attention of those who urged
objections.
   Their utmost universal adoption for thirty years in France,
and for three years in the United States, excited the attention
and inquiry of medical men, who, though slow and cautions at
first to credit the possibility of the existence, much less to re-
commend the adoption of a “Preventive to Conception,” could
not, however, resist the conviction that forced itself upon their
minds, from the fact, observable particularly in France (since
the introduction of Madame Restell's celebrated “Preventive
Powders”) of intervals of four or five years between the birth of
children, became convicted that it is the only mild, safe, and <u title="efficacious">ef-
ficatious</u> and certain remedy, and have, with the honorable
promptness, characteristic of the profession, when once satis-
fied of its <u title="beneficial">benificial</u> effects, unhesitatingly recommended their
adoption.
   Madame Restell, as is well known, was for thirty years Fe-
male Physician in the two principal Female Hospitals of Europe
—those of Vienna and Paris—where, favored by her great ex-
perience and opportunities, she attained that celebrity in those
great discoveries in medical science so specially adapted to the
female frame, for which her medicines now stand unrivalled, as
well in this country as in Europe. Her acquaintance with the
physiology and anatomy of the female frame, enabled her to ar-
rive at a knowledge of the primary causes of female indisposi-
tions—especially of married females—which, in 1808, led to the
discovery of her celebrated “Preventive Powders.”
   Their discovery, introduction, and adoption, are fraught with
such lasting and serious consequences to the welfare, the peace,
the health, the well being of husband, wife, mother, and child-
ren, that the advertiser would be recreant to the duties of huma-
nity, if she did not avail herself of the first opportunity, to ex-
pose, in the most explicit manner, the artifices, schemes, and
plans concocted to trifle and perhaps destroy the dearest interests
of the married or those about to be married, by the designing, to
rob them not only of their money but of their happiness, by
getting up counterfeit and imitation “Preventive to Conception,”
highly destructive to the constitution.
   The following has heretofore been, and is now the method by
which some ignorant and luckless quack hopes to dupe the public:
He first hires some woman, who immediately, as if by magic,
becomes “<i>Madame</i>,” and of course, “<i>Graduate as Midwife and
Female Physician from Paris</i>,” (it is thought that through this
means the deception can be better accomplished;) the next step
is to adopt the <i>headings</i>, and as near as possible, the <i>language</i> of
Madame Restell's advertisements; then to adopt for their dele-
terious compounds, the <i>names</i> of Madame Restell's remedies;
and, in short, to imitate Madame Restell in all her medicines.—
Thus, if Madame Restell has “Preventive Powders,” “Female
Monthly Pills,” &c. they must have something with the same
name. These ignorant pretenders also attempt to confine ladies
during confinement, &c. &c.
   By such shallow and catchpenny expedients do they imagine
the public are to be duped. If their nostrums were merely
harmless they might be passed unnoticed; but when such dele-
terious consequences must inevitably ensue to those who may
fall victims to the cupidity of these imposters, whether in taking
their nostrums, or entrusting themselves during confinement in
the hands of incompetent and mercenary adventurers, Madame
Restell deems herself called upon to warn females against these
attempts to deprive them of both their means and health. In
conclusion it is only necessary to say that there are some three
thousand letters in the possession of Madame Restell in proof
of the efficacy, safety, certainty and healthiness of her celebra-
ted “Preventive Powders,” from all parts of the United States
as well as Europe.

commodate during confinement, which her large and healthily
situated residence so amply affords. <i>No letters received unless

<cl>T</cl>O MARRIED LADIES AND THOSE ABOUT TO
BE MARRIED.—MADAME COSTELLO</f12>, Female
Physician and graduate as Midwife, by the Medical Faculty of
Paris, offers her professional services to the Ladies of this city
and country. The anatomical and physiological peculiarities
which distinguish the female from the male, impose upon her
diseases and functions altogether her own. Many of those dis-
eases are exceedingly complicated and obscure, requiring an ac-
curate knowledge of the female system to treat them with suc-
cess. It is a well known fact, that the health of many married
Ladies will not admit of their bearing children without imminent
risk of their lives; it is also well known that many married wo-
men are incapacitated for the important office of child bearing,
by some physical deformities or malformation, whereby the
life of the mother and offspring must both be sacrificed. When
things are left to take their natural course, is it not justifiable,
nay, an imperative duty we owe suffering humanity, to give re-
lief in such cases, especially if we possess the knowledge of safe
means or remedies whereby this desirable object can be effected.
Madame Costello's celebrated “Preventive to Conception,” is a
safe, healthy and effectual means—the limiting the number of
children at will. Madame Costello's “Preventive to Concep-
tion” is the only genuine and effectual one ever introduced into
this country.
   Madame Costello has made ample arrangements to accommo-
date ladies on the point of confinement, or those laboring under
obstruction, at her residence 34 Lispenard street, where they
can always have the best medical treatment and the most ma-
tronly care and nursing.
   Madame Costello's Female Monthly Pills, are a safe and ef-
fectual remedy for removing all female obstructions or irregu-
larity of the monthly periods.
   N. B.—These Pills must not be taken during pregnancy, as
they would produce abortion.
   Madame C. regrets that hereto she has occasion to caution the
ladies against spurious imitations.
   To those ladies suffering from Weakness or Whites, Madame
C. would say that she has an effectual remedy for this most
distressing complaint.
   Madame C. can be consulted at her residence No. 34 Lispenard
street, at all times and with the strictest regard to secrecy.

   A R<small>EMARKABLE</small> C<small>OINCIDENCE</small>.—On Monday mor-
ning, Joseph Brown, Esq. of the Atlantic Hotel, was
charged at the Police Office with insulting wife
of Charles Lohman, a book binder, who resided at
148 Greenwich street. When the lady and gentleman
appeared before the magistrate to make their charge
against Mr. Brown, the lady was asked if she was
not Madame Restell, to which she replied in the ne-
gative. The charge against Brown was dismissed,
and then he turned round and swore that Charles
Lohman had robbed him of a diamond breast pin to
the value of $<u>100</u>.
   On this complaint Master Lohman was brought
up and submitted to an examination, by order of
Justice Stevens. Lohman, on this, said that Brown
came to his house in Greenwich street, and was
turned out for improper behaviour to the ladies, in
which turning out, he might have lost his breast pin.
This story was very feasible, and therefore the ma-
gistrate held Charles Lohman to bail—but <i>only</i> in
the sum of $100. Robert <u>Famaris</u>, tailor, of Fulton
street, thereupon came, and gave bail for the ac-
cused—who of course was liberated. The coinci-
dence in the case is this, that on the 17th of August,
1839, one Charles Lohman, and Dr. Evans, appeared
and testified as bail in the case of Caroline Restell.
Yet the present Charles Lohman, and his lady say
they are not the same persons, although residing at
148 Greenwich street.

	UNITED STATES CIRCUIT COURT.
		Before Justice Kirtland.
   <i>Charge of Robbery</i>.—On Saturday night, a man
named Joseph Brown, was taken into custody by a
watchman, on charge of disorderly conduct, at the
house of the notorious <u>Madam</u> Restell, 148 Green-
wich street, Brown was subsequently liberated from
custody, yesterday. Mr. Brown came to the Police,
and preferred a complaint against a man named
Charles Lohman, charging him with having stolen
from him, (Brown) on Saturday night last, a diamond
beastpin, value $<u>50</u>.
   Lohman, (who is the same individual who, on the
17th of August, 1839, became joint bail in $1,500 for
Madame Restell,) on his examination, stated that he
resided at 148 Greenwich street; was 32 years of age,
born in Russia, and a book-binder; that on the Sa-
turday night in question, Brown <i>insulted</i> his wife,
that he attempted to put him out of doors, but being
unable to do so, called to his aid a watchman. He
denied having stolen the pin, but presumed that it
might have been lost in the scuffle. Lohman was
required to give sureties in $100, and Mr. Robert
<u>Farmariss</u>, of 154 William street, becoming his bail
in that amount, he was liberated.

   <i>Junk Shops</i>.—In a report of a case of “<u title="Robbing in Courier-1841-02-03">Robbery</u>
and Arrest,” published in our <u title="Wednesday's">Tuesdays</u> paper, our re-
porter was made by the printers to say, that the sto-
len property was found in possession of an “<i>Irish</i>
shop-keeper.” The report should have read “<i>Junk</i>
shop-keeper,” when it would have been “all right.”
   James Ritchie, the junk shop-keeper alluded to was,
as we before stated, committed and still remains in

   On his examination yesterday, he stated that he
was born in Scotland, 36 years of age, a commission
agent, resided last at 13 <u>Chesnut</u> street, and by ad-
vice of his counsel, declined answering further ques-
tions.
   From the confession of George Griffin, one of the
thieves, it appears that upwards of 100 bags of coffee,
valued at more than $<u title="2,500 in Herald-1841-06-15">5,000</u> had been stolen from
Messrs. <u>Merles'</u> store at different times since July last,
all of which were purchased by Ritchie for $2 per bag.
George Rankin, another of the thieves, upon his ex-
amination, confessed that he was concerned in steal-
ing the coffee, and that he was first induced to do so
by Ritchie, who asked him to sell some coffee from
<u>Melre</u>'s store.

   ☞ T<small>O THE</small> P<small>UBLIC</small>.—Having been misrepresented in
the reports of some of the prints in regard to an occur-
rence which took place a day or two ago, in which I am
made to appear as the “reputed” husband of Madame
Restell, &c. &c. As she is a lady of some seventy-three
years of age, I must decline the honor of being consid-
ered in that light. Madame Restell is obliged, from the
demands upon her time, to authorise others to act in her
place. On Saturday evening last, a fellow entered
Madame R.'s office, and on being asked his business, made
propositions of an insulting nature to my wife. I was
called, and immediately caned him out of the house, and
had him taken to the watchhouse, where I presume he
spent a very pleasant night, and on the following
morning brought before the police. During the scuffle,
this vagabond charges me with having taken a breast-
pin, for which I shall take measures to prosecute him
criminally; for if our families are to be insulted in our
very houses, and by our firesides, and when summary
steps are taken to chastise the insulter, we are to be
charged with whatever loss of property the infamous
scoundrel may have alleged to have sustained, it be-
comes a question whether we have a right to protect our
families from insult in our own house, without incurring
the risk of being apprehended for larceny. Under such
circumstances no man is safe. This fellow called him-
self by the various names of Thompson, James Brown,
(the name he assumed at the watchhouse) and subse-
quently at the police office, Joseph Brown. He is a ra-
ther tall, light complexioned, silly looking fellow;
wears brass spectacles, and hails from the Atlantic Hotel,
and answers to the description of a fellow going about
town insulting females, which sometime since appeared
in the Sun.			CHARLES LOHMAN, Publisher.

   <i>The Staten Island Mystery</i>—On Monday last, a
“tale of mystery,” fraught with horrors, appeared in
some of the daily papers, all about a certain Mrs.
<u title="Murrell (above)">Morrill</u>, wife of a Greenwich street Dry Goods dealer,
having, with her child, eloped with a dark visaged
<u title="cavalier">cavillier</u>—how she went to a southern city, where
she wsa met by her husband, who took her in charge—
how the husband soon died, and whose body was
brought to Staten Island for burial—how the body
was exhumed on suspicion of deceased having been
poisoned, and all that sort o' thing.
   The truth of the whole matter, as far as we have
been able to ascertain, is in substance as follows:
   About a twelve-month since a Mr. <u>Morrill</u> was in
possession of a dry goods establishment in Green-
wich street—a wife and daughter. His business not
proving so good as he had anticipated, he sold off his
stock and left for Baltimore, there to commence busi-
ness anew. Some time passed without any informa-
tion from him reaching his family, till at length the
news of his death was formally communicated to
them. The intelligence was so authentic in its char-
acter as not to admit of a doubt.
   The widow of course settled her affairs as all wi-
dows do, and should do, shortly after, she was ad-
dressed by the “dark cavalier”—none other than a
Mr. Anderson, well known in this city. Marriage
was proffered and accepted, and soon the nuptial knot
was tied. The honey moon was, however, scarce
over before the veritable Mr. <u>Morrill</u> made his ap-
pearance and laid claim to his wife; Mr. Anderson
of course evacuated the premises, and Mr. <u>Morrill</u> took
possession as in duty bound. The husband, wife and
child left for Baltimore, for a new home which he had
there provided. Shortly after the arrival of the party
there Mr. <u>Morrill</u> was attacked with the cholera mor-
bus, of which he after a six days illness died; he was
regularly attended by a physician, who at his death
gave a regular certificate of the cause thereof. Mrs.
<u>Morrill</u> accompanied the body of her husband to Sta-
ten Island preparatory to its interment by the side of
his foregone relations. The lady in the confusion of
the mournful propensities, had forgotten the physi-
cian's certificate, and the relatives of the deceased
fearful all was not right, called in the coroner to ex-
amine the body.
   An inquest was accordingly held, which resulted in
accordance with the testimony of the afflicted widow.
The burial ceremony was then performed. The inno-
cent prattling child, however, chanced afterward to
lisp something about the marriage of her mother with
the “dark cavalier.” Suspicions of poison, or other
means of violence, were roused anew in the breasts of
the relatives of the deceased, and it was determined
that the body should be disinterred, and a furhter in-
vestigation into the matter had. The body was ac-
cordingly exhumed, a <i>post mortem</i> examination held,
and the stomach and parts adjacent were placed in
charge of Dr. Chilton, of this city, for the purpose of
chemical analysis. The Doctor having carefully and
faithfully analyzed all the contents of the stomach,
has reported to the afflicted and affrighted relatives
that as to the matter of poison, or any other circum-
stances calculated to excite suspicion, he has found—
nothing. And thus the matter ended.

   <i>Rape</i>.—A female named Charlotte Griffin, of 141
Essex street, whose husband is now in prison on
charge of grand larceny, complained on Saturday
at the police, that on the 7th ult. Peter Ritchie, bro-
ther of the notorious coffee receiver, James Ritchie,
now in prison, assaulted her with great violence, and
attempted to commit a rape. Ritchie was arrested,
and committed in default of $1000 bail required.

   T<small>HE</small> S<small>TATEN</small> I<small>SLAND</small> M<small>YSTERY</small>.—We learn from
Dr. Chilton, that no traces of poison are to be found
in the stomach and intestines of the late Mr. <u>Mor-
rill</u>. The lady has returned from Baltimore, and
afforded satisfactory testimony to the friends of the
late Mr. M., that the deceased died from <i>cholera
morbus</i> after six days illness. It seems he had a
strange aversion to the medical profession, and re-
fused to have a doctor up to the fourth day of his
attack. To the remonstrances or entreaties of his
wife, he replied that if he was not better “by to-
morrow, they might send for an herb doctor.” Of
course, he got no relief form such an <u title="empiric">empyric</u>, and
his death on the sixth day need astonish no one.
Under the circumstances of the case, it must be
highly satisfactory to all parties, that a complete in-
vestigation has taken place, and that after the nu-
merous tests, which the skill and science of Dr.
Chilton has submitted the stomach and intestines to,
that no traces of poison has been discovered.

   C<small>HARGE OF</small> R<small>APE</small>.—Peter Ritchie, a brother of
James Ritchie, who is in the tombs for receiving sto-
len goods, was brought up, charged, on the oath of
Charlotte Griffin, with pulling her on a bed, and
thence taking certain liberties, et cetera. Peter said
he did not mean any thing offensive to the lady; but
seeing as how her husband and his brother were both
in the tombs on a charge of felony, why he only
wished to pay her certain little delicate attentions.—
The Magistrate committed Perter to the tombs.

   Mary Ann Rogers, a nymph of the pave, was

pronounced both the fair ones to be frail, and con-

such, to go to the penitentiary.
   This may be very even-handed justice, but it
strikes us as very likely creating a job for a “Judge

girls have got money enough to get out a writ of ha-
beas corpus, and $10 each in addition, to pay the
fees of the “Judge at chambers,” we know a “high

<i>CAUTION TO MARRIED & UNMARRIED LADIES</i>.
<m9><cl>M</cl>ADAME RESTELL, Female Physician, would caution
females against a daring and infamous fraud attempted to
be practised by some unprincipled and disreputable person call-
ing herself “Costello,” by surreptitiously causing the insertion
of an advertisement, (unknown to the editors of the print in
which it appeared,) falsely purporting as coming from “Ma-
dame Restell,” alleging that Madame Restell had removed her
office, and associated herself with this “Costello” woman.
Madame Restell need only here state that no such “removal” or
“association” has taken place, and that the advertisement allu-
ded to was inserted without her knowledge or sanction. This
“Costello” is an impostor, who is by turns a washerwoman, a
cook, sometimes a fortuneteller, and latterly has advertised her-
self herself (by way of change) as “Costello, Female Physi-
cian, graduate from Paris,” and has endeavored to counterfeit
and imitate the subscriber's celebrated “Preventive Powders,”
“Female Monthly Pills,” and her other medicines, against whose
tricks and impositions Madame Restell has cautioned the pub-
lic. Chagrined and disappointed in her schemes, she now re-
sorts to the desperate though shallow falsehood of asserting that
Madame Restell has removed from her own elegant house and
residence to “associate” herself with one of the very persons
against whom her “cautions,” &c. are directed. This ignorant
woman and the quacks who instigate her, will find themselves
mistaken in their estimate of the good sense and discrimination
of the public in this their last desperate but truly pitiful scheme
at brazen imposition.			MADAME C. RESTELL.

<m9><cl>T</cl>O MARRIED WOMEN—MADAME RESTELL, Fe-
male Physician, is happy to have it in her power to say that
since the introduction into this country, about three years since,
of her celebrated Preventive Powders for married ladies, whose
health forbids a too rapid increase of family, hundreds have
availed themselves of their use, with a success and satisfaction
that has at once dispelled the fears and doubts of the most
timid and sceptical; for, notwithstanding that for twenty years
they have been used in Europe with invariable success, (first
introduced by the celebrated Midwife and Female Physician
Madame Restell, the grandmother of the advertiser, who made
this subject her particular and especial study,) still some were
inclined to entertain some degree of distrust, until become con-
vinced by their successful adoption in this country. The re-
sults of their adoption to the happiness, the health, nay, often
the life of many an affectionate wife and a fond mother, are too
vast to touch upon within the limits of an advertisement—re-
sults which affect not only the present well being of parents, but
the future happiness of their offspring. It is not but too well
known that the families of the married often increase beyond the
happiness of those who give them birth would dictate? In how
many instances does the hard working father, and more espe-
cially the mother, of a poor family, remain slaves throughout
their lives, tugging at the oar of incessant labor, toiling to live
and living but to toil; when they might have enjoyed comfort
and comparative affluence; and if care and toil have weighed
down the spirit, and at last broken the health of a father, how
often is the widow left, unable, with the most virtuous inten-
tions, to save her fatherless offspring from becoming degraded
objects of charity or profligate votaries of vice? And even
though competence and plenty smile upon us, how often, alas!
are the days of the kind husband and father embittered in be-
holding the emaciated form and declining health of the com-
panion of his bosom, ere she had scarce reached the age of
thirty—fast sinking into a premature grave—with the certain
prospect of himself being early bereft of the partner of his joys
and sorrows, and his young and helpless children of the <u title="endearing">ender-
ing</u> attentions and watchful solicitude, which a mother
alone can bestow, not unfrequently at a time when least able
to support the heart rending affliction! Is it desirable, then
—is it moral—for parents to increase their families, regard-
less of consequences to themselves or the well being of their
offspring, when a simple, easy, healthy, and <small>certain</small> remedy is
within our control? The advertiser feeling the importance of
this subject, and estimating the vast benefits resulting to thou-
sands by the adoption of means prescribed by her. Is it not wise
and virtuous to prevent evils to which we are subject, by simple
and healthy means within our control? Every dispassionate,
virtuous, and enlightened mind will unhesitatingly answer in the
affirmative. This, then, is all that Mrs. R. recommends or ever

	<f12>MADAME RESTELL'S APPEAL TO
		PHYSICIANS.</f12>
<cl>G</cl>ENTLEMEN,—I take the liberty of addressing you on
a subject the importance of which your daily experience
in the course of your practice fully demonstrates; a subject
which cannot and should not, if it could, be longer trifled with,
connecting itself, as it does, with the health, the well-being,
the happiness of those entrusted to your charge. Feeling a
deep interest in all that tends to alleviate, if not to prevent the
suffering, both physical and mental, often endured by married
females, whose formation being such as, in the event of their
becoming mothers, to destroy health, and not unfrequently en-
danger life.   I address myself to your candor and humanity,
whether it be not but the performance of a duty imposed upon
you as individuals worthy of the confidence you enjoy, as well
as an act alike of justice and humanity to your patients, to take
ordinary pains to convince yourselves that my Preventive Pow-
ders for ladies in such delicate and precarious health, as to for-
bid a too rapid increase of family, are really what they purport
to be, and therefore entitled to the popularity they possess, and
in all respects worthy of recommendation, as being one of the
greatest blessings yet discovered in medical and physiological
science, as destined to rescue many an affectionate wife and
fond mother from sinking into an early and premature grave?
or whether they are to be classed with the innumerable speci-
mens of no definite virtue? It behooves you, gentlemen, to re-
flect that the consequences resulting to the welfare, the health,
the happiness of those adopting the use of these powders are too
serious; their effects either for good or for evil too important
to be treated with the sneer of indifference or the smile of in-
credulity; for if by their adoption health is improved, life
prolonged, much mental and physical suffering prevented, the
pecuniary circumstances of parents advanced, thereby the
means for the proper education of their offspring better provi-
ded for and secured; if, I say, results so beneficial naturally
and necessarily flow from their adoption, (which I can satis-
factorily establish,) you are called upon as men, as husbands,
as fathers, to lay aside your prepossessions as physicians, and
aid in extending and enlarging the circle of their benign influ-
ence, that the blessings to be derived from their adoption may
be spread far and near, and thus be the means of prolonging the
life of many a faithful and affectionate wife, who, but for their
adoption, after lingering out a sickly, and consequently unhap-
py existence, would have been cut off in the midday of <u title="existence">exist-
nece</u> from amidst those whom she was attached by ties most
near and dear. True it is, that from the sordid, the narrow-
minded, or the selfish, nothing can be expected, since the gen-
eral introduction of the “Preventive Powders” will, by remo-
ving the cause of many complaints to which females would other-
wise be subjected, necessarily diminish their practice and abridge
their profits; but surely, the high-minded, the liberal, the up-
right, the honorable, the humane, I trust and hope will not,
from any motive of pecuniary disadvantage to themselves, be
deterred from recommending to married females under their
care and adoption of means at once efficacious, healthy, and cer-
tain. I am the more fully persuaded of this, from the fact that
not a few have been induced to adopt their use, by the advice
and <u title="recommendation">recommenddtion</u> of physicians. While, however, I solicit
your aid in furthering and extending the blessings, the use of
my “Preventive Powders” will confer on those adopting them;
I pledge myself to desist from recommending their use, if their
effects, or the consequences of their adoption, can be shown to
be otherwise than of the greatest possible advantage. The
“Preventive Powders” were first introduced in France about
thirty years ago, by the grandmother of the subscriber, the
well-known and celebrated Madame Restell, for many years
Female Physician in some of the principal Female Hospitals in
Europe; and the efficacy and safety of the “Preventive Pow-
ders” for married ladies whose health will not admit of too ra-
pid increase of family is a sufficient commentary on her ac-
quaintance with medical and physiological science. On their
introduction into this country, the distrust and incredulity at
first entertained, have given place to that confidence naturally
inspired by the success of their adoption, by thousands who

   T<small>HE</small> W<small>EATHER</small>.—Nothing can exceed the singu-
lar and sudden changes in the weather. Since last
Saturday morning we have had three snow storms,
two tremendous storms of wind and rain, and all the
intermediate hours displayed the mildest and most
bland spring weather. Yesterday it snowed nearly
all day.

day, that it was currently reported, the whole of
these worthies died suddenly of the mud fever. We
received a note from one of the up-town inspectors
yesterday, denying that he was dead, and asserting
that he had never known a day's illness in his life.
We are glad to learn this fact; and are also happy
to find that the street inspector of the Second Ward
is still alive. He was seen looking at some of the
mud in Ann street yesterday, but he did not succeed
in carrying the whole of it away. However, it is
something to be able to say that he looked at it.

<m9>		<f12>FEMALE MONTHLY PILLS.</f12>
<cl>M</cl>ADAME RESTELL, Female Physician, being fully satis-
fied, from her perfect acquaintance with the peculiar phy-
siology and anatomy of the female frame, that most of the
complaints to which females are subject, have their source al-
most invariably in the suppression and irregularity of those
functions of nature to which every female is indebted for
health, strength, cheerfulness, and of consequence, to happi-
ness. To this cause can we attribute those violent and convul-
sive headaches, derangement of the stomach, gnawing in the
side, burning in the chest, disturbed and feverish sleep, fright-
ful dreams, languor, debility, weakness, a most distressing le-
thargy and disinclination to activity or employment, deathly,
sallow, and inanimate complexion, want of appetite, and in
short, the utter prostration of the very susceptibility for the
enjoyment, or even, in many instances, endurance of life, en-
gendering that melancholy of mind and depression of spirit that
make existence itself but a prolongation of suffering and
wretchedness, and which, alas! not unfrequently dooms the un-
happy victim to the perpetration of suicide. Those dreadful
and alarming symptoms are removed in a few days by the use
of the Female Monthly Pills.
   The adoption of the Female Monthly Pills in the Female
Hospitals of Europe, as well as Madame Restell's other reme-
dies, in consequence of their efficacy and safety in all cases of
irregularity or suppression of the menses, from whatever cause
produced, as well as their adoption in this country to the ex-
clusion of the various worthless compounds heretofore offered,
is well known.

	<b>Theatricals in the United States.</b>
   The present state of theatrical in this country
very much resembles the state of the stock markets;
sometimes up, sometimes down—sometimes slightly
prosperous, but mostly depressed and stagnant.—
	...
   Fanny Elssler has at last reached New Orleans,
after making $30,000 in Havana; and the enthu-
siasm was greater there than it has been elsewhere.
She rode on horseback from the levee to the hotel,
and the cushion on which rode was put up at auc-
tion and sold for $200. It is not true that any of the
Southerners compelled her to lengthen her petti-
coats on the stage. She had not engaged in New
Orleans at the last accounts, but is sure to get $800
or $1000 a night, as often as she plays there.
   There are no other new theatrical movements
worth mentioning.

		<b>Court of Oyer and Terminer.</b>
   M<small>ARCH</small> 13.—This tribunal meets this day at 11
o'clock, and it is understood that Judge Gridley, of
the Albany Circuit, is to replace the petulant and
deaf functionary who has hitherto presided in this and
the Circuit Court. The Criminal Calendar only con-
tains one case of any magnitude—that of Ezra White,
with which the public has been sufficiently nau-
seated, and only now wish to be relieve from, even
if it should result in the liberation of a murderer <i>scot
free</i>.
   It is said that the watchman is not forthcoming,
and if so, White's acquittal is certain. Indeed, that
was evident on the first trial, when that witness was
absent until the afternoon of the second day, and had
the late Mr. Graham, hurried, instead of procrasti-
nating the first day's proceedings, a verdict of Not
Guilty must have been the result, before that watch-
man came upon the scene.
   Having taken up, from the very first arrest of
White, a very strong opinion of his guilt, and having
experienced the tender mercies of the very gang that
he was chief of, in this city to the terror of the peace-
able, we cannot but admire the legal tact and foren-
sic ingenuity of Mr. Graham in so perseveringly fol-
lowing all the mazes of the law until his client's li-
beration is almost certain. Our opinion of the mo-
ral effects of such formalities will never be altered,
although White's victim was “never nothing but a
foreigner, and he a native born citizen.”
   The civil calendar is understood to contain more
than 300 cases, so that Judge Gridley will not re-
pose on a bed of roses during his sojourn in New
York.

			<b>Special Sessions.</b>
   M<small>ARCH</small> 13.—This tribunal met on Saturday, in
order to clear out of the tombs, a number of petty
thieves, respectable loafers, and other small fry of
the criminal code.
   <i>Rowdies</i>.—John Haggerty, without the O, was put
to the bar, charged with assaulting a middle aged
lady, by endeavoring to get into a bed where she
and three more were reposing in the arms of Mor-
pheus.
   John's defence was, that another gentleman was
in the room, and that he believed he, John, should
make the party more numerous but not less respec-
table.
   The Court held this defence to be inadmissi-
ble, and sent John Haggerty<u> !</u> to the tombs for 30
days.
   Sally King was tried for assault and battery, and
sent to the tombs for ten days, to see if that would
mend her ways.

	GENERAL SESSIONS.—Yesterday.
   Jane Louisa Riley was tried for grand larceny in
stealing $43 worth of cloth from Messrs. Lozee &
Mott. The jury found her guilty.
   Henry Ketcham was tried and convicted of assault
and battery, and fined $7, which he paid.
   Edward Thompson was tried and convicted of bur-
glary in the third degree, and was sentenced to the
state prison for two years and two months.
   Ann Sharp was tried for assault and battery, with
intent to kill Charles Kelley. The jury found her
guilty of assault only, and the court sentenced her to
the penitentiary six months.
   Emma Francis was tried and convicted of assault
and battery, with intent to kill Michael Higgins with
a knife. The court sentenced her to the state prison
for three years and two months.
   Several others were tried for petty offences and ac-
quitted.
   The Grand Jury came in with a number of bills of
indictment, and also presented as a nuisance, the fur-
niture, and old clothes, and such like articles of mer-
chandise, with which Chatham square and the streets
adjacent are, and have been for a long time continually
filled.
   The Grand Jury also made the following
			PRESENTMENT.
   On closing the arduous labors of their session, the
Grand Inquest cannot refrain from respectfully mak-
ing to the Court the following <i>Presentment</i>:—
   We are aware that the province of the Grand Jury is
mainly to examine such complaints as may be laid be-
fore them against persons accused, or suspected of
crime; but we feel it to be also our privilege as well as
our duty, to act in some degree as guardians of public
morals, as well as of the public weal.
   In this view we feel bound to employ our powers,
as well for the prevention, as for the punishment of
crime.
   Our attention has been strongly drawn to a sub-
ject which we regard as pregnant with incalculable
evils.
   The Court is too well acquainted with fallen human
nature not to know that there are crimes, which but
for the fear of detection, would be much more com-
mon than they now are, and that if this wholesome
restraint shall be removed, the corrupt passions of
thousands would lead them to the violation of all the
principles of virtue, charity and virgin honor.
   We respectfully invite the attention of the court
to the advertisements constantly appearing in the
newspapers of our city, of a certain “Madame Res-
tell and a Madame Costello,” in which, among other
things, they offer to the community an article styled
by them “Preventive Powders,” “preventive <u>of</u> Con-
ception.” We present herewith to the court two
copies of the <i>New York Herald</i> containing these ad-
vertisements. We need not expatiate on the evils
which may grow out of this abomination.
   The enlightened mind of the court will at once per-
ceive the facility thus furnished to those who dread
<i>crime</i>, far less than <i>detection</i>, and how the vile se-
ducer is thus enabled to present to his victim, that
which removes the last fear which remains after his
surmounting all other obstacles. We earnestly pray
that if there is no law that will reach this, which we
present as a <i>public nuisance</i>, the court will take mea-
sures for procuring the passage of such a law.
   Another evil, to which we invite the attention of the
court, is the encouragement afforded to early juvenile
crime, by the practice of keepers of Junk shops of
purchasing from <i>minors</i>.
   A very painful case of this kind has been before the
jury at the present session, among the many com-
plaints which have been preferred against keepers of
such shops as receivers of stolen goods.
   A law forbidding under severe penalties the keepers
of these shops from purchasing any article whatever
from <i>minors</i>, we think will be highly salutary, and
have the effect to drive the numerous youthful prow-
lers for plunder, to seek some respectable and honest
employment.
   These suggestions, the Grand Inquest respectfully
submit to the superior wisdom of the Court, feeling
that they are made from a strong sense of feeling and
a sincere desire to prevent crime, and improve the
morals of our noble city.

term, and the Court adjourned.

		<b>PRESENTMENT.
Madame Restell's Reply to Mr. John D.
   <u>Keese</u> (Druggist,) and other Gentlemen of
   the Grand Jury.</b>
G<small>ENTLEMEN</small>—
   As you have thought proper to overstep the strict
bounds of your duties, and gratuitously, and doubtless
disinterestedly, stepped forward to take under your guar-
dian and fostering care the “public morals” of this “no-
ble city,” you will not, I hope, deem it impertinent in me
to examine briefly the premises and reasons you adduce
to found the very eminent danger to “public morals” you
seem to apprehend from the nature, purpose, intention,
and object of the “Preventive Powders.” I will not
charge you, gentlemen, (as some evil disposed people
would,) with being instigated by sinister, mercenary,
selfish, corrupt, or unworthy motives. I will not, for a
moment, suppose that the cause you have thought proper
to pursue had any—the remotest—reference to any pecu-
niary feeling of one or more of your body. I am suffi-
ciently acquainted with “fallen human nature,” to know
that the wisest, most virtuous, and upright, are not al-
ways exempt from improper influences in their conduct
and duties. The desire to be commended, worthily or
unworthily—a craving to figure before the world as the
stern champions of “public morals,” and thus, by infe-
rence, to be supposed possessed of a goodly share of “pri-
vate morals,” is but natural to “fallen human nature.”
With your motives, therefore, gentlemen, I have nothing
to do, presuming them to be correct.
   But you will pardon me for dissenting from you in the
low estimate of female character which you express in
your presentiment. I cannot subscribe to the monstrous
doctrine that there is no moral principle, no conscious-
ness of right, no instinctive perception of virtue, that ac-
tuates female conduct, instead of the “fear” and “res-
traint” you allege. I cannot conceive how men who are hus-
bands, brothers, or fathers, can give utterance to an idea
so intrinsically base and infamous, that their wives, their
sisters, or their daughters, want but the opportunities and
“facilities” to be vicious; and if they are not so, it is not
from an innate principle of virtue, but from fear. It is
humiliating to find men in this enlightened age, with all
the contracted views and prejudices in regard to morals,
as connected with females, that should make a heathen of
the fifteenth century blush for very shame. What! is
female virtue, then, a mere thing of circumstance and
occasion? Is there but the difference of opportunity be-
tween it and prostitution? Would your wives, and your
sisters, and your daughters, if once absolved from fear,
all become prostitutes?—all sell their embraces for gold,
and descend to a level with the most degraded? Such
abhorrent, detestable, and disgusting estimate of female
virtue, it is hoped may be confined within the narrowest
possible bounds. No high-minded, virtuous and enlight-
ened mind can entertain it. But I distinctly and unequi-
vocally deny that the object, or intention, or effects of my
“Preventive Powders” are such as you seem to imagine;
and am prepared to prove to the satisfaction of even the
most prejudiced mind, that their general and universal
introduction would have a decidedly moral influence, by
inducing early marriages; and in the language of my
“Circular,” “young persons seriously attached to each
other, and who might wish to marry, would marry early,
merely resolving not to become parents until prudence
permitted it. The young man, instead of solitary toil,
or vulgar dissipation, would enjoy the society and the
assistance of her he had chosen as his companion; and
the best years of life, whose pleasures never return,
would not be squandered in riot or debauchery.”
   But it is not in this respect only that the introduction
of the “Preventive Powders” would have a moral effect.
It is well known among physicians, (of which fact you
should have acquainted yourselves,) that there are some
women who cannot, except at the imminent peril of their
lives, and the certain sacrifice of that of their unborn
offspring, give birth. Is it not moral for those to have
the “Preventive Powders” to save their health—their
life? Many weakly wives have been saved from a pre-
mature grave, to be a succor and a blessing to those near
and dear to them. And are we to forego an actual good,
because, if perverted, it may possibly offer “facilities”
to evil? Nor shall we know where to stop, if we follow
up this principle. If you give your sons lessons in me-
chanics? But then you give them “facilities” to pick
locks. If you teach them to read? But they may obtain
“facilities” to falsehood and folly. If you instruct them
in writing? But they may become possessed of “facili-
ties” to forge.
   It is not for me, gentlemen, to advise a respectable bo-
dy of men in the duties belonging to Grand Jurors; but
it suggests itself to me, nevertheless, that too much cir-
cumspection cannot be used in making “presentments,”
to avoid hasty, inconsiderate and injudicious conduct,
bringing the body and the institution into just ridicule
or rebuke. Hoping that nothing herein contained will
be construed into disrespect towards you, and having
with yourselves the greatest regard not only for “pub-
lic” but “private morals,”
	I remain, gentlemen, with sincere respect,
			C. RESTELL, Female Physician,

   The presentment of the Grand Jury, in relation
to the advertisement of Mesdames Restell and Cos-

abomination in the noble city,” was read and refer-

speech, in which, amidst cries of order, order, he
persisted in saying that the Grand Jurors were over
tenacious of the morals of this noble city, while the
Governor had the power to appoint one for Recorder
who was covered with gross corruption, &c., and he
hoped the committee would take the matter in hand
and enquire into the real character of Fred. A. Tall-

		<m8>Reported for the Courier and Enquirer.</m8>
   <i>A Chapter on Mystery, Blood and Murder</i>.—Yes-
terday was an eventful day in our police annals. The
whole town, was throughout the day in a state of in-
tense agitation and excitement. The first great cause
was the arrest and imprisonment of the notorious
<i>Madame Restell</i>.
   The story of her arrest and the cause which led
thereto (in stating which we are compelled for want
of room to be as brief as possible,) is as follows:—
   In the month of May 1839, Mrs. Ann Maria Purdy,
wife of William W. Purdy, then residing in Mott street,
being enceinte, and having at the time a child only ten
months old, resolved upon the adoption of some course
to procure abortion.
   She concealed her intentions from her husband,
and consulted an old negress—the washerwoman for
the family on the subject. Procuring a copy of the
Sun newspaper, she therein found one of Madame
Restell's advertisements. The old negress informed
her that she knew of a young woman in Mulberry
street, who had been relieved by Madame Restell,
without any difficulty whatever.
   On the 1st of June, Mrs. Purdy called at the resi-
dence of Madame Restell, stated her case, and procu-
red a vial, for which she paid one dollar. The con-
tents of which she was directed to take several times
per day, until the desired relief was afforded. Return-
ing to her home, she for several days took the medi-
cine as directed; but becoming alarmed at the symp-
toms which followed, she sent the phial to Dr. D. D.
Marvin, to learn of him the nature of its contents.
Dr. Marvin having examined the medicine, pronoun-
ced it to be a compound of oil of <u title="tansy">tanzey</u> and spirits of
turpentine. He addressed a note to Mrs. Purdy,
stating that the medicine was of a most deleterious
and dangerous character, and could not be administer-
ed without the greatest hazard being incurred.
   The medicine was then laid aside. The female “in
Mulberry street” was consulted, but refused to give
any information as to the course adopted by Restell
in her case.
   Mrs. Purdy then made another visit to Mrs. Res-
tell, and was informed by the latter, that an opera-
tion could be performed by a <i>woman</i> which would
relieve the patient, without causing the least pain or
<u title="inconvenience">inconvience</u>, or danger of exposure. The terms
agreed upon were, that Restell should receive $20 for
her services. Mrs. Purdy said that she was unable
to procure funds without her husband's knowledge
and offered to give to Restell a pledge ticket for a
gold watch worth $20 in lieu of the money. She
then went away, and as agreed upon, at 8 o'clock on
the next evening she called at Madame Restell's. She
was, after a few minutes conversation, taken into a
back dark room, where by Restell and some <i>man</i> to-
gether, a hasty and violent operation was performed
upon her person. She was after this permitted to
leave the room. She was made to promise never to
disclose what had been done, as, said Mrs. Restell,
“it is a <i>state prison offence</i> & you may be made to suf-
fer for it as well as me.” Mrs. Purdy promised never
to made any disclosure, and left the house in a very ex-
hausted state, took an omnibus and rode home. In
a few days she was taken violently ill and was atten-
ded by Dr. Marvin. The Doctor discovered the cause
of her illness, and Mrs. P. declared to him the fact of
her having visited Mrs. Restell, under a pledge of se-
crecy on his part.
   She continued ill and gradually grew worse till
within a few days her situation becoming extremely
critical, Dr. Kirby was called in to consult with Dr.
Marvin. She was pronounced to be past all hopes
of recovery. This decision of the physicians was
communicated to her, and then for the first time she
expressed a desire to disclose all to her husband.
This was on Sunday last. Mr. Purdy on Monday
came to the police and conferred with Mr. Justice
Merritt on the subject; Mr. Merritt issued a warrant,
which he gave in charge of officer Gil Hays, and pro-
ceeded with Mr. Purdy to his residence. Mr. Merritt
found the unfortunate victim in the last stage of hu-
man suffering, though in full possession of her intel-
lectual faculties. A full and detailed statement of the
facts which we have above given in a condensed
form, was taken down from her own lips, to which
she <u title="subscribed">subscibed</u> her name and swore; the deposi-
tion was read to her a second time; she was remind-
ed of the awful situation in which she was placed,
and the dreadful solemnity of the occasion; she, how-
ever, without wavering, declared that all which had
been read to her was true to the letter.
   Mr. Hays proceeded to the residence of <u>Mad-
dame</u> Restell, where he found her giving audience to
some half a score of her patients in a splendidly fur-
nished parlor, and her <i>husband</i> (?) “Charles Loh-
man,” employing himself the while in an adjoining
apartment in preparing packages of the “Preventive
Powders.” Mr. Hays made known his errand, when
Madame R. demanded his authority, and refused to
accompany him.
   Her name, she said, was not Madame Restell, but
Lohman, the wife of Charles Lohman. She only
“acted as the agent of Madame Restell, of Paris.”
All this talk, however, did not avail her any thing
or frighten Mr. Hays from his purpose, and after
some <u title="parley">parly</u> both Madame Restell and her husband
Charles Lohman, accompanied the officer to the house
of Mr. Purdy, corner of Bowery and Broome street.
   Upon her being brought into the presence of Mrs.
Purdy, the latter readily recognized her as the wo-
man, who more than a year previous had given her
the fatal advice. Mr. Charles Lohman was suffered
to depart, but Madame Restell was conducted to the
tombs, where she was fully committed, there to await
the almost certain event of Mrs. Purdy's death, and
of her own consequent trial. Mrs. Purdy is but 21
years and 6 months of age, and has been married 3
years. She was at last accounts sill living, but ex-
pected to survive but a few hours.

   <i id="Courier-1841-03-24-Mrs-Bird">Chapter 2d.—Sacrifice of another Female through
Ignorance and Malpractice</i>.—Another cause of the ex-
citement prevalent yesterday, was the discovery on
the evening previous of the body of a beautiful young
female, concealed in a box, in Oliver street, in the
neighborhood of the residence of a noted “female
physician,” named Mrs. Bird <i>alias</i> Dawson, in Oliver
street.
   About six o'clock on Monday evening, Mr. Jona-
than Lyon, cartman to Messrs. <u title="Butterfield">Butterfied</u> & Coach-
mon, auctioneers, of Chatham square, was applied to
to convey a <i>long box</i> from No. 20 Orange street to No.
18 Oliver street. The box was taken to the house,
where <i>something</i> was put into it, and it was again put
upon the cart and removed to the house of Mr. John
K. Cowperthwaite, corner of East Broadway and
<u title="Catherine">Catharine</u> street. The circumstance of the box being
somewhat heavier upon coming out of the house than
when it went in, excited Lyons's suspicions, and upon
enquiry, learning that No. 18 was the residence of
the “female physician,” he felt assured that all was
“not right,” and communicated his suspicions to
Mr. Butterfield. The latter sent for officer McGrath,
the coroner and a magistrate, who came, and causing
the box to be opened, it was found to contain the body
as aforesaid. The body was sent to the dead-house,
Park, and yesterday an inquest was held thereon. It
appeared the deceased was born in Connecticut. Her
name was <i>Maria E. Shaw</i>—was twenty years of age,
and till recently resided with her mother, Mrs. Eliza
Hill, in Twentieth street.
   Some weeks since, she being <i>enceinte</i>, came to re-
side with Mrs. Bird, and arranged that her stay should
be prolonged till after her delivery. In a few days
she was taken ill, and was attended by Dr. James
Wright, from the 25th of February till March 11th,
when he ceased visiting her. She was then in feeble
health, but convalescent. The Doctor on leaving,
cautioned Mrs. Bird of the necessity of having a
medical man present on the occasion of her patient's
delivery; this was, however, not attended to. She
was on Sunday about noon delivered of a living fe-
male child. Some unfavorable symptoms ensued,
and Dr. Wright was called in, and about the same
time, Mrs. Hill, mother of deceased arrived. The
Doctor found that some wrong practice had been re-
sorted to, prescribed for deceased, and left. In about
there hours afterwards she was a <i>corpse</i>!
   Mrs. Hill, on her examination, stated that deceased
was always a delicate person, and she had for some time
supposed her to be in a decline. I have visited her
frequently since she had been at Mrs. Bird's. I was
not present at her confinement, but arrived shortly
afterwards. She was attended by Mrs. B. Dr.
Wright arrived after it was over. She was delivered
about 12 o'clock on Sunday, and she died on the
same day. Dr. Wright attended her about three
weeks before her confinement at my request. De-
ceased was not married.
   Margaret Dawson, on her examination stated that
she was the “lady” who answered to the name of
Mrs. Bird. I use this name in my professional busi-
ness. I am a midwife—have practised about twenty
seven years. My business is to board ladies who are
enceinte. Mary E. Shaw was sick at the time she
came to me. I attended her during her confinement
—the labor was not difficult or protracted. The
child is a female, and is still living. Here the wit-
ness recited what occurred after the delivery. She
became alarmed and sent for Dr. Wright. The rea-
son for wishing to have the deceased interred private-
ly, was on account of the disgrace of having an illegi-
timate child. The arrangements was made with Mr.
Cowperthwaite.
   Dr. Wright was consulted as to the expedience of
procuring a private burial, and advised that it should
not be done, as such proceedings always excited sus-
picions. Mr. Cowperthwaite was however consulted
and consented to undertake for a stipulated consider-
ation to remove the body to his own house and have
it buried in the Houston and Chrystie street burial
ground on Tuesday at 10 o'clock. Dr. Wright certi-
fied to the ability of Mrs. Bird as a midwife, and stated
that she had been employed on several occasions by
himself, the late Dr. Bushe and others. The Doctor
gave a certificate that deceased died of <i><u title="uterine haemorrhage">werine hæm-
orhage</u></i>. Doctors Gilman and Cooledge examined
the body after death, and concurred in opinion with
Dr. Wright as to the cause of death.
   The jury after hearing the testimony retired, and
after a two hours discussion on the propriety of <i>pre-
senting</i> Mrs. Bird, as having been instrumental in the
death of deceased, agreed upon the following verdict:
   “It is the opinion of this jury from the facts elici-
ted that Maria E. Shaw was in a very precarious
state of health and much debilitated when she came
to the hands of Mrs. Bird, and that it was highly im-
proper on the part of Mrs. Bird that she did not call
in a medical man to assist her in the <u title="accouchement">accouchment</u> of
deceased, and that she died in <i>child-bed</i>.
<a id="Courier-1841-03-24-ch3-Angel-Magnetism"></a>
   <i>Chapter 3d.—Another mystery, and about a female</i>.
—This is a case which is as the police officers say
“not ripe.” We can only give the circumstances as
they came to our knowledge, in the abstract, and fur-
nish the details on a future occasion.
   The information which has reached the magis-
trates is in brief as follows:
   A certain Dr. <u>Collier</u> has been for some days past
lecturing at Peale's Museum on the science of Animal
Magnetism. The principle subject upon which he
operated was a young female, a recent graduate of a
flash house of ill fame, named <i><u>Angeline Sinclair</u></i>. She
was pretty, rather intellectual, but in a very <u title="delicate">delecate</u>
state of health. She was with another young <i>lady</i>
introduced by the Doctor to a genteel boarding house
in Broadway, kept by a Mrs. T——. It was here dis-
covered that her reputation was none of the best, and
she was furnished with notice “to quit.” She was
however taken ill and obliged to remain. On Satur-
day evening last, she was taken suddenly worse, and
died before midnight. A respectable elderly gentle-
man, a boarder in the house was called up to assist
in “carrying out” the body. He found the body on
the floor in the room, cut and mangled in the most
horrid manner, (probably for anatomical purposes)
and exhibiting a most revolting and disgusting spec-
tacle. On Sunday morning the body was put into a
box and removed from the house, and since then no
trace of it has been found. Such are the facts as com-
municated to the coroner. What will be the result
of the investigation remains to be seen, at present the
matter is to the inmates of the house rather an <u title="= excitable">ex-
citeable</u> mystery.

			<b>City Intelligence.</b>
   T<small>HE</small> A<small>RREST OF</small> M<small>ADAME</small> R<small>ESTELL</small>.—At a late
hour on Monday night, Caroline Lohman, who goes
under the <i title="nom de guerre">nom deguerre</i> of Madame Restell, was ar-
rested at her house in Greenwich street, and placed
in the tombs. The detention of this celebrated per-
sonage is for causing an abortion to a respectable
married female, so long ago as <u title="1840, not 1839?">last</u> summer, and
which would not have come to light but for the fact
of the married lady being now in <i>extremis</i>, and hav-
ing charged the nostrums of Madame Restell as the
cause of her illness. The sufferer, whose name is
Ann Maria Purdy, wife of William <u>H.</u> Purdy, of
Mott street, has made an affidavit, which occupies
nearly twelve folios, and much of the matter there
related is obviously unfit for the public eye. She
says that she is now 21 years of age, and has been
married three years and better. In the month of
May, 1839, she found herself pregnant, and having
then a sucking child, she was very desirous of get-
ting some relief. She talked with a negro wench
on the subject, and the negro said, that if the lady
would read the Sun newspaper, she could see some-
thing there which might tell her how to get relieved
from her burthen. The wench also said, that she
knew a lady in Mulberry street who had read the
Sun, and been in consequence to Madame Restell,
and got relief. Mrs. Purdy, on hearing this got the
Sun, and the negro wench explained the advertise-
ment to her, and about the 1st of June she went to
Madame Restell's and stated her case. Madame
said, for one dollar she would give her a medicine to
cause abortion—and on Mrs. Purdy's paying that
sum, she gave her a small phial containing a yellow
liquid, telling Mrs. Purdy that she must take some
drops of that on a piece of sugar. Mrs. Purdy took
the nostrum home, and took some, but not liking it,
she sent it by a girl to a Dr. Marvin, who said it was
oil of tansy and spirits of turpentine, and a very
dangerous thing to take.
   Mrs. Purdy then consulted the negro wench
again, and having obtained from her the name of
the lady who before consulted Madame R., she went
to her house in Mulberry street, but the lady refused
to give any information about the matter. Mrs. Pur-
dy then visited the house of Madame R., and an
arrangement was made between the ladies, for Mrs.
Purdy to have an operation performed on paying
a fee of $20 in money, or “money's worth.” At
the hour appointed, Mrs. Purdy went to Madame
R., and was taken “behind the curtain,” where to
her great alarm, she found a man, which fact made
her fear she had got into a bad house.<u title="No pair for this">”</u> This man
performed an operation on her, and told her that
most likely she would be sick, and have to employ
a physician, as also give up suckling her infant.—
Mrs. Purdy then left, and got into an omnibus, but was
taken very sick in the vehicle and nearly fainted be-
fore she got home. Before she left Madame Res-
tell's, Caroline Lohman told her that it was a State
Prison offence, and that she, Mrs. P., ran more
risk in the event of a discovery, than herself.
   On the Sunday after this operation, she sent for
Dr. David D. Marvin, and on the following Tuesday
she was delivered of <u title="foetus">fœtus</u>, the after-birth of which
did not come away until the following Friday.
   As Mrs. P. got worse, she disclosed the facts to
her doctor, and on Monday she confessed the facts
to her husband, who took the necessary steps to have
the whole affair placed before the police magistrates,
who immediately placed a warrant in the hands <u>of
of</u> Gil Hays, who proceeded to Greenwich street,
and there saw the lady known as Madame Restell,
lecturing to several, very, interesting looking young
ladies. At sight of the officer, Madame Restell
dismissed her auditory, and asked Gil what he want-
ed; he said he had a warrant for the arrest of Ma-
dame Restell, on which “the lady” asked to see it,
and then said her name was Caroline Lohman, and
that was her husband.
   Gil immediately took them both to the house of
Mrs. Purdy, where “the lady” was identified by
the poor victim as the one who had been present
when the operation was performed. On this the
officer reconducted Caroline Lohman and her hus-
band to the Tombs, where the former was locked
up, and the latter let loose.

   C<small>ORONER'S</small> O<small>FFICE</small>.—M<small>ELANCHOLY</small> A<small>FFAIR</small>.—An in-
quest was impanelled under the direction of Dr. Ar-
cher, to enquire into the cause of the death of Maria E.
Shaw, the young female whose body was found in a
box, by two gentlemen, on a cart in Chatham square,
on Monday night, as related in the Herald of yester-
day.
   It appeared that the deceased was twenty years
and six months old, a native of Connecticut, and the
daughter of a Mrs. Eliza Hill, in 20th street. About
eight weeks ago, the deceased went to board with
Margaret Dawson, <i>alias</i> Mrs. Bird, at No. 18 Oliver
street, being at the time pregnant of an illegitimate
child. She was attended by a Dr. Wright until with-
in a few days of her confinement, which took place
last Sunday, and her mother was sent for and came
immediately. She advised the sending for Dr.
Wright, who came, and finding that the <u title="placenta">placentia</u>
had not been moved, advised the usual remedies.
The child was living and doing well, but the mother
continued to sink, and died of <u title="uterine hemorrhage">exterine hermorrhage</u>.
   Mrs. Dawson and Dr. Wright were both examined
at great length, and a post mortem examination of
the deceased had, by some medical gentlemen, but
nothing of any importance was elicited, except that
the poor girl had been sent to Mrs. Bird to avoid ex-
posure, and that the father of her child was a Mr.
Rodgers, living up town.
   The jury were locked up for two hours, and ten of
them were, at one time, for presenting Mrs. Bird,
the midwife, as the cause of the girl's death; but
they eventually agreed on the following verdict:—
   “It is the opinion of this Jury from the facts elici-
ted, that Maria E. Shaw was in a very precarious
state of health, and much debilitated when she came
to the house of Mrs. Bird, that she did not call in a
medical man to assist her in the <u title="accouchement">accouchment</u> of de-
ceased, and that she died in child-bed.”
   The Coroner also held three other inquests, but
none of which possessed any public interest.
   A<small>NOTHER</small> M<small>YSTERIOUS</small> C<small>ASE</small>.—On Monday an ap-
plication was made to the Coroner to investigate the
death of one <u title=" 'alias' Angelica St. Clair">Angelique Sinclair</u>, a girl who had once
been on the town, but who had latterly been en-
gaged by one Dr. Collyer and other professors of
animal magnetism, to be experimented on, at Peale's
Museum. Another girl was also retained, and the
pair put to board at the house of a Mrs. Theall, ad-
jacent to the Museum. Last week Mrs. Theall told
<u>Angelique</u> that she must quit, but the girl was ill at
the time, and permitted to remain. On Saturday
Dr. Collyer went to her room to prescribe, and while
there a message was sent to a gentleman boarding
in the house, to come and see <u>Angelique</u>, which in-
vitation the gentleman did not accept. Some hours
after he heard she was dead, and went up to the
room and saw Dr. C. performing several experiments
on the body, aided by some very juvenile profes-
sors of surgery and anatomy. When this party had
concluded their experiments, they cut up the body
of the girl and sent it off in a box, since which it has
not been heard of, nor has the Doctor been seen
since Sunday. The whole affair is thought to be
<u title="pregnant">pregnent</u> with suspicion, and as the excitement was
pretty high, we have thought it best to give our
readers such facts as have come to our reporter, even
though the disclosure man be deemed “a premature
one.”

   P<small>OLICE</small> O<small>FFICE</small>.—<i>Mde. Restell</i>, a woman who
had been recently presented by the Grand Jury
for the infamous mode in which she obtains a
living—by ministering drugs, and, as the case in
hand proves, causing surgical operations to be per-
formed, for the purpose of producing abortion—
was yesterday arrested and committed to prison,
on a charge of manslaughter.
   The sufferer was a Mrs. Purdy, wife of Wm.
Purdy, an agent of the Harlem Railroad. This
inconsiderate woman, desirous, it seems, to avoid
becoming a mother, in an evil hour applied to
Mde. Restell. We cannot pursue the detail, but
the result was, that drugs not sufficing, she suffer-
ed an operation to be performed; since which, her
health has steadily declined, and at the point of
death, as she believes, and other think too proba-
ble, disclosed the whole matter to her husband,
before kept in ignorance thereof.
   He applied to Justice Merritt, who, after taking
the dying deposition of Mrs. Purdy, caused the
arrest and commitment of Mde. Restell.

   Another case of excitement, connected with the
death of an unmarried woman who died in the
house of a midwife, and whose body was privately
taken away for interment, occupied the courts.
The victim was Maria E. Shaw, aged 20, who
went to the house of a woman named Bird, <i>alias</i>
Dawson, in Oliver street, and there died in child-
bed. The private interment, it was alleged, was
to prevent exposure of the deceased to shame.
   The Coroner's inquest agreed in the verdict.
   “It is the opinion of this jury, from the facts
elicited, that Maria E. Shaw was in a very preca-
rious state of health, and much debilitated, when
she came to the hands of Mrs. Bird, and that it
was highly improper on the part of Mrs. Bird, that
she did not call in a medical man to assist in the

   M<small>ADAME</small> R<small>ESTELL IN</small> P<small>RISON ON A CHARGE OF</small>
M<small>ANSLAUGHTER</small>.—This woman, who has render-
ed herself infamously notorious, is at last in a fair
way to meet her deserts. The following is the
charge on which she has been arrested. In May,
1839, Mrs. <u title="Ann (elsewhere)">Anne</u> Purdy, wife of Mr. William Pur-
dy, an agent of the Harlem Railroad Company, who
was then only about nineteen years old, became
<u title="enceinte"><i>enciente</i></u> of her second child, having at the time
another child ten months old which she was nurs-
ing. The prospect of having a second child while
the other was yet so young, was extremely annoy-
ing to her, and at the suggestion of her servant, a
colored woman, she applied to Madame Restell to
prevent her becoming again a mother. Madame
Restell accordingly gave her a phial containing a
colored liquid, of which Mrs. Purdy took one or
two doses, without producing the desired effect,
but attended with such other unpleasant feelings,
that Mrs. Purdy fearing it might be unwholesome,
sent it to a medical gentleman in order to ascertain
what were its ingredients. This gentleman inform-
ed her that it was compound of <u title="tansy">tanzy</u> and turpen-
tine, and that it was extremely dangerous to use it
as an internal medicine, and Mrs. Purdy in conse-
quence <s>discontinued</s> the use of it; but being still
anxious to effect her purpose, she again <s>applied to</s>
Madame Restell, who informed her that she could
perform a surgical operation on her person, which
would have the desired effect; for performing
which Madame Restell told her, she received from
$40 to $50 according to the circumstances of the
patient, but ultimately consented to do it in the
present instance for $20.
   As Mrs. Purdy could not conveniently procure
this sum without the knowledge of her husband,
from whom she wished to conceal the matter, she in
a few days after called on Madame Restell and de-
posited with her the pledge ticket for a gold watch;
also, gave her one dollar, being all the money Mrs.
Purdy had with her, and which Madame Restell
insisted on being given to her along with the ticket.
Having thus received her fee or what she deemed
sufficient security for it, Madame Restell then
brought Mrs. Purdy behind a curtain which was in
the room, and a blanket being laid on the
floor Mrs. Purdy was placed on it, and an
operation was performed on her person by a
man, and she immediately after went home
in the omnibus, where she arrived with great diffi-
culty, from the extreme weakness and pain, conse-
quent upon the operation she had undergone. In
two or three days after her visit to Madame Restell,
the operation proved successful in producing a pre-
mature <u title="accouchement">accouchment</u>. And from that time to the
present Mrs. Purdy has never enjoyed a moment's
health and has gradually declined and rapidly ap-
proached her dissolution, in the last stage of con-
sumption.
   Having within the last few days been informed
by her physician that the end of her earthly exis-
tence was at hand, and that she could not possibly
survive many days longer, she thought it her duty
to inform her husband of what she had every reason
to believe had been the cause of her lost health and
approaching death. The husband, on being inform-
ed of it, applied to Justice Merritt, who immediate-
ly waited on Mrs. Purdy and procured, what may
be called, her dying deposition of the above facts,
and then had Madame Restell arrested and commit-
ted to prison on a charge of manslaughter.—<i>Jour-

			<b>City Intelligence.</b>
	...
   F<small>RACAS</small>.—A fracas arising out of the foregoing
case, took place, yesterday morning, at the house
of Mrs. Theall, between Algernon H. Griswold <u>and
and</u> Robert H. Collyer. Mr. G. came to the police
and had a warrant issued against his medical anta-
gonist, and the latter was held to bail. The fair wi-
dow, Mrs. Theall, became surety for the Doctor,
to the amount of $300.
   The Doctor subsequently applied to Justice Mer-
ritt, for a cross warrant, but up to the time for leav-
ing the office, it was not granted.
   T<small>HE</small> C<small>ASE OF</small> M<small>ADAME</small> R<small>ESTELL</small>, <i>alias</i> C<small>AROLINE</small>
L<small>OHMAN</small>.—This celebrated personage was brought
out for examination, on the charge of aiding and
abetting some unknown person in the causing of a
premature delivery of a Mrs. Ann Maria Purdy.
   “The lady” was attended by Messrs. Jordan and
<u>Morrell</u> as counsel.
   Justice Merritt explained the charge, and inform-
ed her of her rights. The Clerk was then proceed-
ing to put the first question—“What is your age,
place of birth, business, residence,” &c., when “the
lady” cut him short by saying “that under the ad-
vice of her counsel she should decline answering any
questions, but for herself she could say she was in-
nocent of that charge.”
   The Magistrate said he should not fix the amount
of bail that night, and thus ended the 2d act of the
drama, which had kept the whole police establish-
ment in a ferment of excitement throughout the day.

   A<small>TTEMPT AT</small> R<small>APE</small>.—James Reed, a young butcher,
was brought up charged with an attempt to commit
a rape on the person of a girl named <u>Mary Ann Mil-
lett</u>, only 9 years of age. The details are unfit for
publication.
	...
   C<small>UTTING</small> O<small>FF</small> H<small>EADS</small>.—A very novel case of assault
and battery was tried Wednesday, in the Court of Com-
mon Pleas. It was a suit brought by a <u title="cartman">carman</u>
against a butcher, to recover a compensation in dama-
ges for nearly severing the plaintiff's head from his
body. The facts lay in a nut shell, as the lawyers
say. Defendant had a ferocious dog, which bit the
plaintiff's child, and the latter insisted on the dog
being hanged. A week after the execution of the
dog the butcher got the cartman into his slaughter
house, seized him by the nape of the neck, and actu-
ally cut his throat with a big knife, from the spinal
ridge round to the right jaw, before the cartman was
rescued from his perilous situation. The wounded
man was taken to the hospital, and he had the good
fortune to get cured, as the butcher had missed the
<i>carotid artery</i>.
   For the defence it was set up that the butcher was
insane, and that lunatics were not answerable for
either <u title="trespass">tresspass</u> or tort.
   This point was argued at great length, and finally
reserved for the opinion of the Court above.
   Testimony to the insanity or delirium tremens of
the defendant was adduced, and the jury gave the
plaintiff $500 damages.
   For plaintiff, W. M. Price, for defendant, J. T.
Brady.
   The proceedings in the Civil Courts yesterday were
of no interest, except to the parties litigating and
their legal advisers.

   <i>The Restell Case</i>.—Madame Restell, the “notor-
ious,” was yesterday afternoon brought out of prison
for examination. Her Counsel, Messrs. Morrill and
Jordan, were present and by their advice the prisoner
declined answering any questions. She declared
herself innocent of the charge and was remanded.—

the Police by John Ehler, Secretary of the Patent
Fire-Arms Company, that a young man, clerk in the
Company's employment at their warehouse, 155 Broad-
way, had embezzled money and property to the a-
mount of upwards of $700. A warrant was issued
for the arrest of the delinquent.

   <i>Rape</i>.—A young butcher named James Reed, was
yesterday arrested on charge of attempting to com-
mit a rape on a little girl, 9 years of age, named
<u>Mary Jane Millett</u>, in the house of Benjamin Jacax,
204 16th street. Reed was committed.

   <i>The Broadway Mystery</i>.—Mr. Coroner Archer on
Tuesday evening, proceeded to investigate the mat-
ter of the death of <u>Angeline St. Clair</u>, to which we al-
luded in our paperof yesterday. It appeared that she
had been for some days ill of <u title="erysipelas">erysipilis</u>, though she
was able to attend the lectures of Doctor Collyer, in
the evening. She was attended by Drs. Schmidt
and Oakley, who gave a certificate of the cause of her
death. She was buried by the public authorities on
Sunday. The causes which led to the complaint be-
fore the coroner upon explanation appear far less
horrible than were at first represented. Dr. Collyer
appears to be in no wise censurable in the premises.
   The excitement growing out of the affair led to the
arrest yesterday of Dr. Collyer, on charge of assault
and battery committed by him on Algmoon S. Gris-
wold, a gentleman residing in the same house, 231
Broadway. The Doctor was required to find bail in
$300, which he procured. Mrs. Theall, landlady of
the house, becoming herself his security. The Doctor
then made application for a warrant against Mr. Gris-
wold, charging him with having committed the first
assault.

<b>Madame Restell—Strange Developments com-
   ing—Necessity for vigorous action on the
   part of the Recorder.</b>
   The arrest of Madame Restell, the sudden death
of Maria Shaw, and the story of the post mortem
examination of <u title=" 'alias' Angelique Sinclair">Angelica St. Clair</u>, the girl who had
been assisting in illustrating animal magnetism at
Peale's Museum, have produced a great sensation
in this community, and caused an inquiry into the
condition of public and private morals in this city.
The case of Madame Restell is much the most cu-
rious, and involves the most serious consequences.
Her trial will produce developments the most cu-
riuos, the most startling, the most astounding, that
ever were witnessed in this or any other country.
   Some anxiety has been manifested, to know who
Madame Restell is, her appearance, character, and
history. It is a short story and soon told.
   The person who is now in prison, under the name
of Madame Restell, is an Englishwoman, about
thirty years old, of youthful appearance, with a
bright, intelligent eye, and rather a prepossessing
face. She came to this country about ten years
since, with her husband, bearing the name of Som-
ers. Her husband was a tailor, and worked in one
of the most fashionable establishments in this city.
Mrs. Somers also worked for the same establishment,
and was distinguished for the neatness and rapidity
with which she made vests and pantaloons.
   About five years ago, Somers died, and his widow
subsequently married a Russian of the name of Loh-
man, a printer. He is a shrewd, cunning fellow,
and has written her advertisements, puffs, handbills,
&c. A couple of years after their marriage, busi-
ness called Lohman to Europe. He took his wife
with him, and left her in Paris, while he went to
Russia. While in Paris, Mrs. Lohman became ac-
quainted with Madame Restell, a very celebrated
<i>accoucheur</i> and physician. From her Mrs. Lohman
acquired a knowledge of the practices which she has
followed here, and for which she is now in prison.
   On her return from Europe, she opened a shop in
this city, and adopting the title of Madame Restell,
offered her services to all who stood in need of them.
Shortly after, there was a good deal of talk about
town, and many mysterious hints were heard of cer-
tain curious cases, and threats of strange develop-
ments were muttered, but nothing definite or tangi-
ble came out, and all interest in the matter gradually
died away. Her establishment in Greenwich street
was thronged at all hours. Half a dozen persons
were frequently seen there of a morning before the
shop was open. The most elegant and fashionable
carriages in the city often drew up at her door, a ser-
vant would be sent in, and Madame Restell come out
and enter the carriage. Sometimes the carriage
would drive away with her, and sometimes it would
remain at the door for half an hour or more, with her
inside. Her practice was immense, and among all
classes of people, and she has now between five hun-
dred and six hundred letters, many of them from
ladies in the highest circles of fashionable society,
some married and some single, in this city and else-
where, acknowledging the benefits they had derived
from her ministrations, and thanking her, many of
them, in the warmest terms, for her advice and pre-
scriptions.
   What will be Madame Restell's course with these
letters when she is brought to trial? Will she not
offer them in justification of her conduct? Will she
not plead, that practices which drew from such re-
spectable patients the most animated encomiums,
should be looked at with an eye of lenity?
   We regard the arrest of this woman, and the dis-
closures consequent upon it which must follow, as an
interposition of Providence to crush the whole cor-
rupt fashionable society of this city to atoms. Ma-
dame Restell has been an accomplice with the de-
moralized portion of society, in violating the laws of
God and man. Young unmarried females, moving
in the highest circles, have applied to her for aid,
and she has the evidence of the fact under their own
hands. Men who pretend to be leaders in churches,
leaders of fashion, and leaders of finance in Wall
street, are connected with these extraordinary deve-
lopments. Now is the time to assert the majesty of
the laws, and vindicate our courts from all imputa-
tion or suspicion of winking at iniquity or powerful
connections. Those charged with the execution of
the laws must go on, and rip up the whole of these
dark transactions. There must be no smothering
up, no concealment, no evasion. It is due alike to
the pure and unspotted of our city, and to the sanc-
tity of the laws, that there should be an investigation,
deep though rough. We rely with confidence upon
the determination and energy of Recorder Tallmadge
in this emergency, notwithstanding the mean and
malignant attacks of the Journal of Commerce and
the rest of the sanctified hypocrites, who say to every
man not of their set, “stand by, for I am holier than
thou.” Whatever pranks and foibles may have
characterised his boyish days, he has nothing to
fear in a comparison with most of those who now
pursue him with fiend-like malice. He will do his
duty, and insist upon a thorough, searching scrutiny
into all the circumstances now for the first time de-
veloping the corrupt and demoralised state of fash-
ionable society in this country. Awful disclosures
are coming!

   <i>Madame Restell</i>.—In the case of this notorious
female, Mr. Justice Merritt, after consulting with His
Honor the Recorder, and the District Attorney, de-
cided yesterday morning, to admit her to bail in
$5000 with good sureties. Several <i>respectable</i> individ-
uals presented themselves as bail, but on their learn-
ing that their names would go forth to the world, in
<u title="juxtaposition">juxta-position</u> with that of the woman herself, and as
<d>[Col.4]</d>
semi-accessories in her crimes, they very properly
withdrew. An intense excitement prevails among the
citizens in the upper part of the city—in the neighbor-

should Madame Restell succeed in procuring bail,
that some violence will be attempted upon her person,
or at least her residence.

   M<small>ADAME</small> R<small>ESTELL</small>.—This woman is still confined
in the tombs, not having yet procured bail. The
bail demanded has been reduced to $3000. The in-
terest in this case seems not to abate at all. Seve-
ral persons about town have undertaken to make an
outcry on account of our comments upon the disclo-
sures that an investigation would produce. This is
unwise. Those who exclaim against the tone of our
remarks, subject themselves to the suspicion of being
implicated in some of the woman's transactions. None
whose hands are clean can apply anything we have
said to themselves. The existence of such an estab-
lishment as Madame Restell's in this country, fur-
nishes abundant evidence of the spread of corruption
among the fashionable circles. It is a damning fact
which no clamor can remove. The prosecution of
Madame Restell may be quashed, all judicial inves-
tigation may be stifled, but the dark spot can never
be effaced. We have more to say on this subject
hereafter.

   T<small>HE</small> C<small>ASE OF</small> M<small>ADAME</small> R<small>ESTELL</small>.—The counsel for
this person got out a writ of habeas corpus and
had her brought before Judge Inglis for the purpose
of getting the bail reduced or ascertaining if the Po-
lice Justices had not permitted some irregularity to
creep into their proceedings, by which a discharge
could have been effected. About 4 o'clock the pri-
soner was brought up in the custody of Hyde, the
jailer, and she had scarcely been in his Honor's room
five minutes ere the place was filled to repletion by
the veriest set of loafers<u> </u>it was our ill fortune to en-
counter in a similar confined situation. The very
windows of the office, and the tables were occupi-
ed with the lady's admirers, and it was only by re-
moving <u>Madam</u> into an inner room out of the sight
of her numerous friends and disciples, that his Honor
was enabled to proceed.
   Messrs. <u>Jordon</u> and <u>Morrell</u> both urged upon his
Honor the impossibility of the accused getting bail
in the sum of $5,000, and the injury which her health
must suffer if detained in prison until her trial could
be brought on. The learned and eloquent gentle-
men also called his Honor's attention to several tech-
nical objections to the proceedings. Mr. Whiting,
on the part of the people, said that the bail was not
too high. That in the case of Glentworth similar
sureties had been required and given. That the
offences charged against this woman were notorious
as the sun at noonday. The press had teemed with
her <u title="iniquities">iniquites</u>, and like the common thief, the com-
mon pickpocket, and the common vagrant, her very
notoriety made it incumbent on the authorities to
take such sureties as would compel her <u title="presence">presense</u> at
the day of trial.
   Mr. <u>Jordon</u> briefly replied, and denied the legality
of excessive bail, founded on any newspaper para-
graphs, or <u title="outdoor">out-door</u> prejudices, set afloat possibly by
men as corrupt, if not as depraved as his client was
falsely alleged to be. Judge Inglis said he would
take the papers home and give a decision in the
course of the next afternoon.

	BEFORE JUDGE INGLIS—At Chambers.
   <i>Madame Restell</i>.—This notorious personage was
brought before Judge Inglis yesterday afternoon on
a writ of Habeas Corpus. She was accompanied
from the “Tombs” to the City Hall by her <i>husband</i>
(?) Charles Lohman, and Capt. Hyde, and closely at-
tended by a troupe of loafers and rowdies, whose curi-
osity was excited by the novelty of the scene and the
occasion. Within and around the Judge's chambers
a dense crowd of citizens assembled, all eager to sa-
tisfy their curiosity by a glimpse at the woman.
   The pressure of the crowd became at length so
great that, Judge Inglis was compelled to order the
prisoner to be removed to an <u title="anteroom">ant-room</u>, adjoining
the office. Upon this the excitement partially subsi-
ded and a portion of the crowd dispersed. His Honor
was then enabled to proceed to business.
   Messrs. Morrill & Jordan, counsel for the prisoner
moved for a reducing of bail (5,000) and argued that
the bail should be fixed at a mere nominal sum. The
motion was opposed by J. R. Whiting, Esq., District
Attorney.
   The motion was argued at some length by the
counsel on either side, and at the conclusion of the ar-
gument, His Honor took the matter into considera-
tion, remarking, that he would render a decision at an
early hour this morning.
   Madame Restell attended as before, with some dif-
ficulty made her egress through the crowd, and was
returned to her old quarters, at the city prison.
   We did not learn that any persons presented them-
selves as her bail.

   H<small>ABEAS</small> C<small>ORPUS</small>—M<small>ADAME</small> R<small>ESTELL</small>.—This
woman was yesterday, at 4 o'clock, taken out of
prison, and carried before Judge Inglis, at Cham-
bers, in the City Hall, on a writ of Habeas Corpus,
in order as well to test the validity of her imprison-
ment, on the charges preferred, as to obtain a re-
duction in the amount of bail. Her counsel, Messrs.
Jordan and Morrill attended, and the former not
only took sundry technical exceptions to the affida-
vits and proceedings before the Police magistrate,
which he contended were not entirely according to
the requirements of the statute, but also contended
that the bail demanded was exorbitant, for a mere
case of misdemeanor, as he alleged this was, in
which the maximum of punishment, if found guil-
ty, was $500 fine, and one year's imprisonment in
the City Prison. The District Attorney, J. R. Whi-
ting, Esq., replied to the remarks of the counsel for
the accused, and dwelt at considerable length on
the infamous notoriety the prisoner had acquired
by her circulars and advertisements, and the vi-
ciousness of the employments in which she had
been for years engaged. He contended it was not
a mere common case of misdemeanor, but one of an
aggravated character with which she was charged;
and that the question as to the bail, was not whe-
ther it was great in proportion to the punishment
for the offence; but whether it was such sufficient
bail as would induce her to stand trial, and not
by forfeiting it, to escape conviction, and punish-
ment.
   He contended that the bail instead of being too
high, was too low; that the proceedings, prelimi-
nary before the magistrate, and up to the time of
her commitment to prison, were correct and con-
formable to the statute; and offered to read the
original affidavit and accompanying papers, to show
the aggravation of the case, and to satisfy the
Judge that the bail was not too high. He said he
should also move to have the amount of bail increas-
ed. Mr. Jordan rejoined to the remarks of the District
Attorney, objecting to the reading of the original
affidavit; and contending, again, that the proceed-
ings in some particulars he named, were not ac-
cording to statute, and that the bail was fixed so high
as to preclude the obtaining of it. But that if the
bail were fixed at a reasonable amount, unexcep-
tionable bail would be given. His Honor Judge
Inglis said he would examine the matter, and de-
cide to-day at 11 o'clock. The District Attorney
said he would require one day's notice as to the
names of the persons, who were to become bail,
that he might have time to inquire into their suffi-
ciency, which His Honor granted. Madame Res-
tel, alias Lohman, was then reconducted to prison.

			<b>At Chambers.</b>
			Before Judge <u>Ingliss</u>.
   Madame Restell, alias Caroline Lohman, was
brought before his honor again to hear his decision
on the writ of habeas corpus.
   His honor decided that all the proceedings were
perfectly regular, and that he should not make any
order to reduce the bail below three thousand dollars,
but he thought it would be advisable to have two
sureties, one in $2,000, and one in $1,000.
   The lady was then remanded in custody.

   M<small>ADAME</small> R<small>ESTELL</small>.—This woman was taken out
of prison on Monday afternoon, and conducted by
Capt. Hyde, the keeper of the prison, to the resi-
dence of Mrs. Purdy, where the District Attorney
and Justice Lownds, with Mr. La Forge, the coun-
sel of Mrs. Purdy, were in attendance to examine
the latter in presence of the accused, in regard to all
the matters with which the prisoner stands charged.
Mrs. Purdy, who is a small, delicate and lovely
looking young woman, with a very innocent expres-
sion of countenance, and a large dark and intelli-
gent eye, was reclining on her bed, unable to rise;
her skin of the purest white, and a slight hectic
flush, the emblem of consumption on <u title="her cheeks">herc heeks</u>.
She was perfectly composed, though very weak, and
reiterated all of her former statement, and something
more, in reply to the various interrogatories pro-
pounded to her by counsel, all of which questions
and answers were carefully taken down by the Dis-
trict Attorney and read over to, and signed by the
complainant. Mrs. Restell, alias Lohman, on be-
ing asked whether she desired counsel, which she
was told she could have, if she wished, drew out a
written document, drawn by her employed counsel
protesting against the examination, and the pro-
ceedings in all their parts. She sat unmoved, with-
out the <u title="slightest">slightests</u> trepidations, or <u title="apparent">appearent</u> con-

she was reconducted to prison. Mrs. Purdy was

tinued until about 4 o'clock, and appears to be
rapidly sinking into the arms of death.—<i>Express</i>.

<b>“Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not
			go unpunished.”</b>
   Those who have access to the daily papers of our city,
have observed, ere this, that the notorious Madame Res-
tell, whose vile advertisements have so long disgraced
the press, is at length incarcerated in the “Tombs,”
awaiting her trial, and the sentence of a legal tribunal.
In the providence of God, tangible facts are now before
the public, which seem to prove, beyond a doubt, the deep
guilt of this unhappy woman, and those identified with
her in her work of death.
   Our hearts have long bled over this moral <u title="maelstrom">maelstroom</u>,
and we felt on reading the following presentment, that
<i>prayer</i> has been heard and answered. The fact that the
grand jury have at length taken so firm a stand against
this heroine of licentiousness, and her vile traffic, affords
ground of encouragement that our city is not to be whol-
ly given up, so that it shall be said “Justice is fallen in
our streets, and equity cannot enter.” Let our rulers
once “quit themselves like men,“—and form a patriotic
phalanx for the defence of that “righteousness” that
“exalteth a nation,” and the panders of vice, would not,
as now, walk forth with boldness, and perform their
deeds of darkness year after year, with none to molest
or make them afraid.
   Since the developments of certain facts in this case,
we have noticed that the public press utters a united voice
of condemnation. Those papers too, which have hitherto
stooped so low, as to become the faithful and successful
coadjutors in aiding and abetting these designs of evil,
by giving them publicity in their most offensive and dan-
gerous forms, now attempt to speak as loudly as the rest
in tones of censure? Truly, “out of their own mouths
are they condemned.” We learn from our Visiting Com-
mittee who have visited the prison since the confinement
of Madame Restell, that she appears extremely hardened,

and wholly inaccessible to religious truth or christian
faithfulness. Vigorous efforts are making by a certain
class to release her—but unless there is a radical change
of heart and life, it is to be hoped that her future influ-
ence may not be felt beyond the walls of a prison, and that
there, if no where else, she may be made sensible of the
enormity of her guilt, and led to exercise genuine repen-
tance.

but a small portion of the whole number through-
out the United States. From that date to the first
of April, there have been 74 murders and 63 sui-
cides. Of these, 19 came to sudden death by in-
temperance; 12 by taking laudanum, and other poi-
sons; 7 by hanging themselves; 7 by cutting their
throats; 8 by drowning, and 5 by shooting them-

Mrs. Hannah Ashford, No. 225 Henry street, in
company with Henry Green, undertook to break
out of his cell in the 3d tier of the city prison, on
Sunday night. He tore up his blankets and made
of them a handsome rope, and then with an old
case knife and the leg of his bunk, he succeeded in
removing all the small stones in the eastern side of
his cell, in an aperture large enough to pass through,
and was engaged in removing the large stone that
remained, the only bar to his escape, when the
noise aroused Ezra White, who was confined in
the cell underneath him, who alarmed the keepers,
and who running in, stopped the prisoner's opera-
tions, and placed him in double irons, where he will
remain until sentenced.

now in prison, on a charge of causing the
death of a Mrs. <u title="Purdy">Purday</u> while endeavor-

   <i>The Case of Madame Restell</i>.—We have already stated
that the Grand Jury of this City have found a true bill of in-
dictment against Caroline Lohman, <i>alias</i> Restell, for her ne-
farious practices in the procuring of abortion, which in some
cases have resulted in lasting injury to if not the death of her
victims. It will be seen by reference to our report of the do-
ings at the Court of Sessions, that the motion made by her
counsel, John A. <u>Morrell</u>, Esq. to quash the indictment, was
argued yesterday and is to be decided to-day.
   We would like to know how it is that Justice has slept so
long over the iniquities of this wretched woman, and how the
Grand Jury could now resolve to bring her to account without
a whisper of rebuke her equally guilty <i>accomplices</i> in the
work of corruption and death. Two years ago, we (while
temporarily conducting the New-York Whig.) called public
attention repeatedly to the atrocious and abominable adver-
tisements which were then blazoned in <i>The Sun</i> and Ben-
nett's <i>Herald</i>, urging the <i>Ladies</i> (!) of New-York to avail
themselves of the benefits to be derived from Madame Res-
tell's practices. We remonstrated against the public tolera-
tion of such scandalous and depraving practices and the un-
blushing effrontery of the woman and her coadjutors of the
Sun and Herald in proclaiming their joint iniquity. But no-
body else moved a finger, and the horrible baseness went on
in broad daylight, and flourished. At last, when the woman
had made a fortune, and her newspaper accomplices large
sums by their mutual iniquity, a deluded creature is nearly
murdered, through the joint influences of publications in The
Sun and the practices of Madame R. and behold, Justice is
<i>almost</i> aroused! He opens one eye, reaches out his arm and
grasps one of the culprits, leaving the other untouched! is
this right? Ought they who for base lucre have wilfully
abetted beforehand the crimes of this wretch to escape
wholly unpunished? The public must answer.
			———

<d>[Col.4]</d>
   <i>Case of Madame Restell</i>.—Messrs. Morrill and Jordan, in
conformity with notice previously given moved to quash the in-
dictment against Caroline Lohman, alias Madame Restell, Mr.
Morrill read an affidavit of the accused, alleging that the bill
was found against her by the Grand Jury, by virtue of illegal
testimony taken before the Grand Jury in admitting the writ-
ten examination under the oath of Ann Maria Purdy, taken <i>de
bene esse</i> on the 5th inst. pursuant to an order of this Court, be-
fore the Recorder and District Attorney, the accused protesting
<s>????????????????? On the statements put</s> forth on this
affidavit the motion to quash was made.
   The District Attorney opposed this motion, on the ground that
there was nothing in the affidavit to justify to motion to quash.
He contended that an affidavit, on which was based a motion to
quash, must show upon its face that the indictment was defective,
or founded on incomplete, imperfect, and illegal testimony. The
affidavit must state those facts and what they are.
   It is not contended that the indictment is not correctly drawn,
and it does not appear on what evidence the bill was found, whe-
ther on the oath of a Grand Juror, or the testimony in the form
of affidavit, of Mrs. Purdy. The Complaint taken at the Police,
must go before the Grand Jury, in order to show them what the
complaint was and what evidence was necessary to sustain it.
There was nothing in the affidavit to show that the Grand Jury
found the bill on the affidavit or testimony of Mrs. Purdy, or on
what testimony it was found. The complaints of parties must go
before Grand Juries, and there is nothing in the affidavit read
on which the Court could entertain this motion.
   Mr. Morrill of Counsel replied and argued the motion at great
length, in favor of quashing the indictment for reasons he ad-
vanced. He cited numerous authorities in favor of his motion,
viz: the case of Smith and Ogden tried more than 30 years ago
before Judge Matthias <u>Talmadge</u>, in the U. S. Court, in which it
is laid down that a motion to quash an indictment can be sus-
tained on the ground of illegal testimony before the Grand Jury.
Also the case of the Rev. Dr. Dodd, and Leech's Crown Law, p.
155; and other authorities. He contended that Mrs. Purdy
should have been taken before the Grand Jury to testify in the
case, instead of having her affidavit and examination before that
Grand Jury as evidence.
   Mr. Jordan also argued at considerable length in favor of the
motion to quash, and was followed by the District Attorney,
who cited Archibald, criminal law, p. 66, to show that a motion
to quash, must be based on an affidavit setting forth on what ille-
gal testimony the indictment was found, which the present affi-
davit did not; and contended that the affidavit and the allega-
tions therein were not sufficient to found a motion upon, to quash
an indictment. Mr. Jordan rejoined at some length, and argued
the sufficiency of the affidavit.
   The Court, after hearing the arguments, stated that they
would examine the authorities, the affidavit, &c. and decide
upon the motion on Wednesday afternoon, (this day.)

amount. In fact so long as so great an amount was re-
quired his client was undergoing an amount of punish-
ment, though not convicted, almost equal to the extreme
punishment that could be awarded if a jury should say
she was guilty of the offence, with which he contended
she was improperly charged.
   The Recorder said, after consultation with his col-
leagues, we are of opinion that the bail is not too much,
and therefore we cannot interfere.
   The Court then proceeded with the trial of petty lar-
ceny cases of no public interest. After which the
Grand Jury came into Court with a number of bills, and
were discharged, with the thanks of the Court.
   The <u title="petit">pettit</u> jury were also discharged, after the term,
and the Court adjourned until Thursday at 4 P. M.

   <s>???</s> H<small>ORACE</small> <u>G<small>REELY</small></u>, the galvanised squash among

to try, convict and punish Madame Restell, for acts
and practices in causing abortions.
   Certainly—let her be severely punished—but let
no abortionists escape justice. During <u>Greely</u>'s ca-
reer as an editor he has murdered probably six or
seven young infant newspapers—some penny—some
two penny—but all fresh and healthy. He has done
this by his detestable pills, generally composed of
galvanised New England squashes. The abortions
that this editorial Madame Restell in pantaloons,
hanging with one brace down to the middle of his
leg, have been awful, terrible, horrible. He once
wanted to prescribe for the Herald, when it was a
sweet babe, and no doubt he would have killed it
outright, but fortunately he was not allowed to use
his squash pills upon it.
   <u>Greely</u> is now procuring the abortion of a new
penny paper, and we have no doubt he will succeed
—particularly as the State Barber helps him. <u>Greely</u>
is probably the greatest pumpkin now connected

   D<small>EATH OF</small> M<small>RS</small>. P<small>URDY</small>.—The known victim of the horri-
ble cupidity, depravity and quackery of Mad. Restell and
her confederates, <i>died</i> of the injuries sustained at the hands
of these creatures, on Wednesday evening—aged about 22
years. Her sufferings for many weeks have been so great
that death was to her as an angel of mercy.
   What should be the punishment of those by whose deprav-
ity this poor victim has been brought to an untimely grave?
Recollect that she was first tempted to apply to the creature
Restell by a servant, who brought her the advertisements of
that fiends in the columns of <i>The Sun</i>. This was long after
the conductors of that paper had been publicly and anxious-
ly remonstrated with and shown the iniquity of publishing
those advertisements. But what cared <i>they</i> for crime or
misery, so long as either could fill their greedy coffers with
gold? No! urge on the work of death! Let crime and sin
riot in the vitals of the community, so that the dollars are
only poured merrily in! And thus, by constant publication
and puffing in <i>The Sun</i>, backed by puffing Editorials in the
<i>Herald</i>, the dreadful trade of this wretch was made to thrive
and gold flowed in streams into her den, and thence to the
pockets of her newspaper accomplices. Must not this
blood-money prove a curse to its receivers?
   Of course, Mrs. Purdy is not by any means the only vic-
tim of these horrible practices. Doubtless may others have
yielded up their lives to her perilous prescriptions, conceal-
ing their shame and their guilt in the darkness of the grave.
What demoniac practices shall be next resorted to, to glut
the avarice of those vampyres?

   <i>Death of Mrs. Purdy</i>.—Mrs. Purdy, the unfortu-
nate victim of the notorious Madame Restell, now in
prison on charge of murder, died yesterday, at the
residence of a relative in New Jersey. Mrs. Purdy
was, two years since, when first she consulted the
fiend Restell, in the bloom of health and beauty.
She was, when she died, but twenty years of age.
This is only an isolated instance of the ruin which
the wretched culprit has practised upon her own spe-
<d>[Col.4]</d>
cies within a few years past. She is now, thank
heaven, safe in the hands of the law, and will not be
suffered to escape, till she and all her coadjutors have
rendered mete sacrifice at the shrine of justice. Sev-
eral persons have recently offered to become bail for
Restell; but upon their being required by the Magis-
trates to justify as to the amount and whereabouts of
their means, they have in every instance <i>backed out</i>.
It requires <i>character</i> as well as means to succeed in
such a cause.

rate either for weal or woe to the prisoner. As she has
the best legal advisers, and they are capable of bringing
all the features of the law to the aid of the defence of their
client, she may be acquitted for want of testimony. On
the other hand if the examination, taken <i>de bene esse</i>, is
got before the jury, then the death of the unhappy lady
must have such an effect on the jury as to insure her
conviction.

   <i>Madame Restell</i>.—It has been stated in the journals
generally that this wretched woman has been indicted for
manslaughter. This we are informed is a mistake; she is
only on trial for a <i>misdemeanor</i>, and the only punishment
that can be inflicted upon her if found guilty, is a fine of
$1,000 and imprisonment in the City prison for one year.
What effect the death of her victim, Mrs. Purdy, will have
on her case we are not aware. We understand that with the

some $20,000 by her horrid trade. This will undoubtedly

			<i>A Visit to the Prison.</i>
   <i>March</i> 29<i>th</i>.—In company with Sister P——, visited,
for the first time, our city prison, which contains at pre-
sent one hundred and forty-three prisoners, mostly males.
I was struck with the youthful appearance of the inmates.
The majority were between the ages of fifteen and thirty;
notwithstanding their crimes have been such as to forfeit
their liberty, they do not generally appear to be hardened
in sin.
   The first cell visited, was occupied by a young girl, ap-
parently not over seventeen years of age. She had been
confined here five months—was associated with a woman
who appeared to be an old offender. They both expressed
much gratitude for the tracts, and were willing to have
prayer offered on their behalf. While we bowed together
before the mercy-seat, they sighed and groaned aloud.
   As we passed from cell to cell, our tracts and papers
secured for us a cordial reception, in every instance save
one. Nearly every hand was extended to receive the lit-
tle messenger of mercy. We had conversation with
most of the prisoners, many of whom were affected even
to tears. With one heart, most of them informed us, that
<i>bad company</i> had brought them here.
   Found one young man destitute of a Bible, whom we
supplied. Met with another, who, during his confine-
ment, had read the Bible through.
   One young man, very intelligent and gentlemanly in his
address, informed us that he had just received his sen-
tence to spend five years in state's prison. This unhappy
youth spoke of his crimes with such deep humility and
brokenness of spirit as would have melted a heart of
stone. I urged upon him the claims of the gospel, and
the consolations of religion, as being adapted even to the
gloomy walls of a prison, and begged him to look to God,
against whom he had sinned for peace and pardon
through the blood of the cross. He replied, that after liv-
ing in sin twenty years, it was hard to bow before the
Lord, and with tears in his eyes requested prayer to be of-
fered for him. Before leaving, he promised to pray for him-
self. May the Lord hear the sighing and groaning of
these poor prisoners, and emancipate them from the
bondage of sin, from the service of Satan, and deliver
them from the prison of hell. We were consoled with
the reflection that these were not endless sighs, nor ever-
lasting groans—that they are still on praying ground, and
a ray of hope beams into these dark abodes.
   In one of the cells visited, we found that “mistress of
abominations,” whose polluted and polluting advertise-
ments have been the means of leading thousands of our
sex to infamy and death. It may be recollected, that the
case of this individual, and her notorious <u title="traffic">triffic</u>, was al-
luded to some time since in the Report of the Visiting
Committee, in the Advocate of August 15th. The prepa-
ration of that Report was the last labor of the kind per-
formed by a beloved member of this Committee, who is
now (if living) on the confines of the grave. We remem-
ber her tears when presenting this Report, and the deep
anguish of her soul, as she inquired, “Cannot something
be done to save our city from such contaminating influ-
ences?” It was benevolence, patriotism, true Christian
feeling, that moved her breast; and, could she see this
woman now in her solitary cell, she would doubtless
“thank God and take courage.” She would not rejoice
in the prospect of her punishment, in itself considered—
but a class of emotions would be awakened, such as may
be felt by the Christian, living or dying, in view of a
greater good, purchased at the expense of a lesser evil.
But to return. Our visit was received by Madam R——
<d>[Col.2]</d>
with great indignation. She remembered a former con-
versation—that my companion had told her of her guilt;
and its inevitable consequences—and her countenance
expressed what was said by one of old, “Art thou come
hither to torment me before the time?” Poor fallen wo-
man—such was not our purpose. We would fain have
pointed her to Him who has said to the truly penitent,
“Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as wool;
though they be red like crimson, they shall be whiter
than snow;” but her heart was harder than the nether
mill-stone. She rejected the tract, saying she had plenty
of good reading, pointing at the same time to a lot of
novels with which she was supplied; and, turning her
back in anger, said, “I will hear nothing from you—I
fear neither God or man, nor care for heaven or hell!”
The keeper remarked that she was visited by hundreds
wearing the garb of gentlemen, and no pains or expense
would probably be spared to screen her from the just
penalty of the law. If she shall be again liberated, and
her career of crime continue unchecked, we know not
what is to become of the morals of our beloved city.

		<m8>Reported for the Courier & Enquirer.</m8>
   <i>Madame Restell</i> alias <i> Lohman</i>.—The counsel of this
woman made a motion in the court of general sessions,
early in the past week, for the quashing of the indict-
ment found against her by the Grand Jury, in which
she is accused of misdemeanor, in having procured
an abortion at the instance of a young married woman
named Purdy, who died on Wednesday last, at
Hackensack, New Jersey, of the effects, it is alleged,
of Madame Restell's mal-practice.
   The motion was made on a legal quibble, and it was
grounded on an affidavit made by Madame Restell, in
which she set forth that she was taken from prison
against her consent to the bedside of Mrs. Purdy,
where Mrs. P. underwent an examination, which was
laid before the Grand Jury, and on which alleged ille-
gal testimony, the indictment was found, and it was
contended that this proceeding being illegal, it vitiated
the whole procedure.
   On Saturday morning, the Court met half past 10
o'clock, and his Honor the Recorder proceeded to
give the decision of the Court on the motion above
<u title="mentioned">mention</u>. He cited a number of cases showing that
the indictment was well founded, and that the affi-
davit of Mrs. Purdy was admissible before the Grand
Jury. Besides, his Honor said it would be highly
improper to quash this indictment or arrest its pro-
ceedings, when there might have been other testi-
mony, parole, oral, or otherwise before them.
   Judge Lynch said he concurred in the opinion of
his Honor.
   Judge Inglis said he did not altogether concur in
that decision, and he then proceeded to read his opin-
ion, in which he held that there were many cases
where the Court not only had the power, but were
bound to quash indictments. He thought, however,
that the Court should be extremely cautious in inter-
fering with the proceedings had before a grand jury.
Another objection to such interference was, that it
would be rendering the Court, to a certain extent, an
examining committee into the action and proceedings
of that body.
   The Recorder said—at the conclusion of Judge In-
glis's opinion, that the Court unanimously concurring,
the motion was denied.
   Madame Restell was then brought out and arraign-
ed—the indictment read to her, to which she pleaded
not guilty. The prisoner was then remanded to
await her trial.

			<b>General Sessions.</b>
Present the Recorder, Judges <u>Ingliss</u>, Lynch, and two
			Aldermen.
   <i>The case of Ann Lohman alias Madame Restell</i>.—His
Honor the Recorder, said that in this case a motion had
been made to quash the indictment found by the Grand
	...
   Judge <u>Ingliss</u> said he concurred generally with the
Recorder, but had some few remarks from cases cited
which he would read to the jury. His principal reason
for declining to quash indictments arose from the fact,
that such a practice had a tendency to make Courts of
Law mere examining committees of the proceedings of
Grand Jurors.
   His Honor then proceeded to read his opinion. And
then the Recorder said that the Court unanimously de-
nied the motion.
   Mr. Morrill said his client was in a very peculiar posi-
tion, she was abused by the press, denied bail, and could
act have a fair trial, he hoped the court would deter the
order to plead.
   The District Attorney said the learned gentleman had
taken time enough, and if he refused to advise his client,
on the motion of pleading the court would advise her to
plead not guilty. After some further conversations the
fair accused was brought into court, looking as <u title="dégagée (free)">degagée</u>
and interesting as possible, and pleaded not guilty.<f>
   <i>False Pretences</i>.—In re William H. Gregory, <u>Roswill</u> L.
Graves, and <u>Roswell</u> Graves, jr., all indicted about three
years since for obtaining monies and securities under
false pretences from Darby Farnham and others in this
city. The Court, with the consent of the District Attor-
ney ordered <i>nolle prosequies</i> to be entered, and the defend-
ants to be discharged.

				—————</f>
   ☞ T<small>O</small> T<small>HE</small> P<small>UBLIC</small>.—The course pursued towards
me by a portion of the public press, is one, to say the
least, highly reprehensible, if not criminally culpable,
inasmuch as its effect is to prejudice and poison the pub-
lic mind, by the gross, and I am inclined to believe, ma-
levolent falsehoods and intentional misrepresentations
which are published with all the exaggeration that ma-
lignity can dictate, or imagination conceive. The 'Cou-
rier and Enquirer' has charged me with 'manslaughter,'
and even 'murder,' knowing at the same time that the
charge is misdemeanor, and has also attempted to create
an impression that I had caused the death of the woman
on whose affidavit I have been detained, when it is
notorious that for eighteen months after her alleged
treatment, (in June, 1839,) she had enjoyed sufficient good
health to enable her to attend balls, parties, &c., with late
hours, and exposures incident to such indulgences. Put
even if it were otherwise, is there any justification for
the uncalled for comments indulged in by the Courier &
Enquirer and others, before the party accused is put on
the defence. Justice and common sense requires that no
party shall be adjudged guilty merely on a charge, as
charges are easily made, and may, on trial, prove un-
founded, false, or malicious. It is a violation of those
rights guaranteed to every individual, if not actually a
contempt of court to proceed to adjudge, and treat the
accused at the bar of public opinion, as guilty, before
trial. Such, however has been the course pursued to-
wards me, and I leave it to the public to say whether it
is not in derogation of every maxim of law, justice, de-
cency, or fairness, subversive of the fundamental princi-
ples of our civil institutions.

   J<small>UDGE OF THE</small> C<small>RIMINAL</small> C<small>OURT</small>.—We find in
the Star of last evening the following article:
		[<i>Extract of a letter from Albany.</i>]
   “You stated a few days ago that the nomination of
M. M. Noah, Esq. as Judge of the Court of Sessions,
had been confirmed by the Senate. This is not the
case, and I regret to learn that five Whig Senators
have expressed an unwillingness to concur in the ap-
pointment, not from personal considerations, but from
old political reminiscences. The interest of the King
family has been actively employed against him, and
religious prejudice forms some part of the objections.
I am sorry to see this want of liberality and fairness
to those who have been zealous and efficient in the
Whig ranks, and to whom there are no real grounds
of objection. The three Senators from the First Dis-
trict, who are most interested, will report in favor of
the appointment; still, I think with the other opposi-
tion, he will be rejected.”

   Let it be “rejected,” then; let us understand
what position the democratic portion of the Whig
party holds in the Senate of this State; and if <u title="the"> he</u>
“Kings are to rule over us,” the sooner we know
it the better. If Whigs in the Senate, now the
conflict is over, are pleased to vote against those
who eminently labored to secure the triumph of
the party, because they were in hostile positions
in 1832, there must be a general breaking up of
parties throughout the State. Major Noah was one
among the first who run up the White flag, and left
his early political friends, because he disapproved
the measures of their leaders; and although he
may be entirely indifferent in relation to this small
appointment, not so his numerous republican
friends in the Whig ranks. We cannot afford to
lose any strength either in this city or State—and
lose it, too, through a want of political fidelity
among our own friends. We shall not be alone,
however, in offering Major Noah a cordial welcome
on his return to the columns of the daily press,
should his nomination be rejected; and the result
has been too long delayed, both in reference to
himself and the important business before the
court.—[Star.]

   We do not know how others may be affected by
the annunciation that a person so wholly unquali-
fied by education, acquirements, and character, for
a judicial station, as <i>M. M. Noah</i>, cannot, even by
the force of Executive recommendation, be thrust
upon the bench,—but we confess our own exceed-
ing gratification thereat, and sincerely hope it may
prove true.
   Whether the fact be as set forth in the letter
above quoted—or whether, indeed, it be a genuine
letter, or one concocted in the office of the Star—
(where the aforesaid M. M. Noah still presides, al-
though nominally retired,) we have no means of
judging, for we have no correspondence in Alba-
ny, and have not, and are quite sure no member of
the “family,” to whose agency so much is falsely
imputed, has used, or sought to use, any influence
or interest with the Senate, on the subject of this
nomination, beyond the opposition openly mani-
fested in this paper.
   If, then, there be five Whig Senators who refuse
to make <i>M. M. Noah</i> a judge, it must be put
down to the score, not of their prejudices, nor of
family influence, but of the demerits of the candi-
date. And who indeed that conceives adequately
of the dignity of the judicial station, and knows,
or will suffer himself to be informed of the utter
want of <i>all</i> the requisites for that station in <i>M.
M. Noah</i>, could hesitate about rejecting his nomi-
nation!
   We speak of this person as he is before the
<d>[Col.3]</d>
public. Individually, and in private life, we know
nothing, and seek to know nothing, of him; but as
he has manifested himself in his career before the
world, we say, he is destitute of every single qual-
ification for the bench.
   He is, in the first place, without any legal edu-
cation or knowledge. True, that in times past,
to the infinite discredit of the Supreme Court
of this State, he was, from the moral <u title="weakness">weakess</u> that
cannot say No to importunity, or from the sugges-
tions of <i>party</i> associations, admitted, by special
favor, a Counsellor of the Court—but, even the
Supreme Court cannot, by its <i>fiat</i>, convert igno-
rance into knowledge, or flippancy into eloquence.
   He is without principle, if truth be the corner-
stone thereof. He is the author of, and has habitu-
ally practised upon, the doctrine that “all is fair
in politics”—and he never does, and for the many
years that we have been witnesses of his editorial
career, never did, seem to consider truth as a ne-
cessary element of character or rule of conduct.
   Merit, however, is claimed for him, that he aban-
doned his party to join the opponents. He came over
to the opposition, only after, to use his own lan-
guage, “the crust that had been thrown to him
was withdrawn before it was eaten.” He had been
made Surveyor of the Port by General Jackson,
but found he could not be re-appointed at the ex-
piration of the term.
   He accordingly made a merit of retiring, and
immediately commenced a paper professedly for
the support of Gen. Jackson's Administration, but
in fact to oppose it. He has abused and praised,
supported and deserted, all parties, and unless ru-
mor belie him much, was prepared, in the pinch of
last year's struggle, again to desert and go back to
his old associates.
   Finally, he was the author of the system of drag-
ging into his newspaper the private affairs and the
family connections of those whom he selected for
attack, and first opened the door to that system
of private slander which is improved, and only a
little improved, from the <u title="= ancient">antient</u> National Advo-
cate, by the present New York Herald, whose edi-
tor learned his trade of slander in the office of the
National Advocate.
   We have left bound to say thus much, because
we look upon the article in last evening's paper
as designed—by the intimation, especially at the
close, that M. M. Noah intended to go
back to the public press,—to operate as a
threat of future vengeance against all those
Senators who may oppose his nomination; and we
desire that they should know that there is one press
here, at any rate, what will applaud moral courage,
and has no misgivings about calling a knave a
knave, when the public interest may require it to
be done.
   We shall, moreover, as we are falsely charged
with interfering with this matter, make a point of
transmitting this paper to every Senator, that it
may at least be known what our views are as to
this nomination.

   T<small>HE</small> T<small>RIBUNE</small>.—This is the name of a new
penny paper, which bids fair, we have great satis-
faction in believing, to counteract, in part at least,
the unmitigated evil of its more licentious con-
temporaries.
   The Editor, Mr. Greeley, has talents, know-
ledge, and industry, under the guidance of sound
morals. He has also large experience as an Edi-
tor, and a conscientious sense of the dignity of the
vocation.
   The effect of the existing penny press is, as we
have said above, one of almost unmixed evil. It
panders to the worst passions, and lives upon the
fears, the credulity, and the crimes of the commu-
nity.
   In proper hands, and under due moral restraints,
the minor press could be made as mighty for good
as now, under other guidance, it is for mischief. We
trust and believe the Tribune will prove to be such
an ally in the cause of principle, political and
moral.
   It is Whig in its doctrines; and already, we are
told by the Editor, in only third week of its
existence, it prints some 5500 copies.
   We trust it will go on prospering.

		TO THE PUBLIC
   When, at the solicitation of many ardent Whigs, we com-
menced the publication of a morning penny paper, openly
Whig in character and avowedly to counteract the subtle but
deadly venom which <i>The Sun</i> is now and has for years been
silently infusing into the veins of the body politic, we did not

to state. Two years ago, the ostensible publisher of <i>The
Tattler</i> was publishing a cheap Whig paper, and we for a
short time had partial charge of its Editorial columns. We
then spoke of The Sun precisely as we now do, exposing the
base hypocrisy of its pretensions to independence while in
truth it was the veriest self of Loco-Focoism, refuting its
jesuitical attacks on the Whig cause, and denouncing the hor-
rible prostitution of its advertising columns to the blazoning
of Mrs. Restell's and other leprous advertisements—Madam
Restell's laboratory being then in full operation. In short,
we were then guilty of just such “prevarication,” “false-
hood,” “tergiversation,” etc., as has now sunk us to the rank
of “ex-gentleman” in the eyes of 162 Nassau; but we wrote
the articles in that very office, and they were published in the
<i>New-York Whig</i>. Need we say more?

   A <small>NEW</small> “P<small>APER</small> S<small>NATCHER</small>”—C<small>URIOUS</small> D<small>EVELOP-
MENTS IN THE</small> M<small>ORALS OF</small> P<small>OLITICS</small>.—Scarcely has the
famous “Glentworth case” ceased to be uppermost
in the public mind, when we are again to be pre-
sented with an entirely new illustration of the beau-
ties of “paper snatching” and the morals of Wall
street editors.
   The party accused, in the present instance, of lay-
ing violent hands upon private papers, is no less an
individual than Webb of the “Courier and En-
quirer,” and the party complainant is or was in the
editorial department of the “New World”—Epes
<u title="Sargent ?">Sargeant</u>
   It appears that these two personages, being in
Washington upon similar business, the one to ob-
tain the Post Office in this city, and the other a for-
eign appointment, with congenial appetites to feed
from the public crib, had taken a parlor in common.
But this friendship was not destined to last long, for
Webb soon suspected his friend of not being entire-
ly favorable to his desired appointment, and forth-
with determined to ruin him with those in authority.
Accordingly, unknown to his friend, he lays violent
hands upon his private papers, and extracts there-
from certain “memoranda,” or “notanda,” in which
were used the words “Webster dynasty.” These
<u title="too">t  </u> scrupulous and conscientious editor of the “Cou-
rier” exhibits about to prove his friend <u>Sargeant</u> in
the “Clay interest.” The two return to New York
with disappointed hopes and soured tempers, where
poor <u>Sargeant</u> learns from the new Collector, at the
dancing party given by M. H. Grinnell, the cause of
the failure of his brightest hopes. The scene here
opens, and in the course of a long epistolary corres-
pondence (somewhat spiced) these facts are admit-
ted on the part of Webb:—
   1st. That he took the private papers of his friend.
   2d. That he exhibited them about, to injure him in
a certain quarter.
   3d. That he finally destroyed them, thus cutting
off every explanation or interpretation that the
words might be made to import.
   Here then, is a beautiful illustration of the “Cour-
ier's” regard for the “private papers of a citizen.” No
paper was so loud and noisy in its denunciation of
Recorder Morris,<u>”</u> but he claimed to proceed as a
magistrate, and to act by judicial right. By what au-
thority does the “Courier” pretend to act when he
seizes the private papers of his friend, and without
his knowledge, uses them to his detriment? The
“Courier” should forever remain silent on the sub-
ject of the inviolability of private papers, when con-
victed of the offence in its worst possible form. It
presented us, in the case of Recorder Morris, with a
beautiful theory on this subject, and it has now ex-
hibited to the public a forcible example of its own
practice. As the editor of the “Courier” is given to
writing learnedly on the subject of law, he will no
doubt be able to sustain himself upon some English
reported case—in which the point is conceded that
any person has the right to search the private port-
folio of his friends, seize his private papers, and use
them as he may see fit.
   The public will soon be presented with the details
of this interesting case. The correspondence ought
to be published. Come Epes, out with it.

   A<small>PPOINTMENT OF</small> J<small>UDGE</small> N<small>OAH</small>.—So the appoint-
ment of Mr. Noah as associate Judge of the Sessions,
is come at last. Better late than never. The violent
and disgraceful attack upon Noah, set on foot and
perpetrated by the “King family,” has operated upon
the Senate like a shock of electricity in his favor.
<i>Apropos</i>—This “King concern” wants some spring
medicine to set them on their legs. We must give
them a dose or two, price two pence a piece. They
have been getting rather impudent of late, and want
something to cool them down to decency at least.
The idea that a paltry set of Wall street stock-job-
bers should regulate stocks, exchanges, morals, le-
gislature, law, and appointments to office, is prepos-
terous enough.
   Let Judge Noah take his seat and now to business.

   <i>Trial of Ezra White</i>.—The Court room was crow-
ded to excess in the morning, in the expectation that
the trial of this man would be called on.
   The District Attorney informed the Court that he
was not prepared to proceed, as the principal witness
for the prosecution had left the city; but he had been
informed by his wife that he was expected hourly.
   Mr. Graham, Counsel for the prisoner, said that if
a motion was to be made for a postponement, he
should like to have the cause proceed, and to be heard
in argument against the motion.
   The District Attorney—“I shall not move for a
postponement, but if not prepared, shall not move it
on.”
   Mr. Graham—“Then I beg to inform the District
Attorney, that unless the case be called during the
present term, I shall at its expiration, move the Court
for the discharge of the prisoner.”
   Mr. Whiting said that he should call the case on
Monday morning, if the witness had returned by that
time, and the prisoner was remanded.
   We learn that the absent witness is Wright, the
watchman, upon whose testimony alone the prisoner
can be convicted, and without which White will not
be put on his trial. The probability therefore is, that
he will be discharged by the Court.

since his arrest. He appears in excellent health, and
much improved in appearance since his previous
trial. His skin which was then sallow, is now of an
alabaster whiteness, and forms a curious contrast
with his long dark straight hair, which is parted and
combed down on either side of his face; his eyes are
dark and of sparkling brightness. It is, however,
difficult to catch a glance from his eyes; as he sits
almost perpetually gazing, or staring on vacancy, ap-
parently unconscious of all which passes around him.
Once & once only during yesterday, was there any per-
ceptible change in the <u>prisoners</u> countenance; a juror
was called up and being required to swear, he persist-
ed for some time in “kissing the book” previous to
taking the oath. The ludicrousness of the circum-
stance, caused a general laugh throughout the court
room, and a kind of sympathetic smile was seen to
cross the countenance of White.
   The Clerk commenced calling the Jury at about
half-past 10 o'clock. Before 2 o'clock, the original
panel of 84, and the additional panel of 200, ordered
the day previous, had become exhausted, and but
seven <i>unprejudiced</i> jurors were found out of the
whole number. Under the law, in addition to a num-
ber specified by order of the Court, no more jurors
could be summoned on a panel, then the number
deficient on the jury to be formed; this number,
then was six; and the Sheriff was compelled to
make a return of a summons of six jurors; and this
tedious process was kept up through the whole day,
till eight o'clock last evening, when a full jury was
obtained. The following are the names of the jury:
Hiram Bartlett, Foreman; Alanson See, Ebenezer B.
White, Albert Beach, Samuel M. Wiseman, George
Bruce, George H. Young, John G. Snow, Joseph
Carlisle, George Lansing, Lafayette Boley, and Archi-
bald C. Reynolds.
   Between 400 and 500 jurors and <i>talesmen</i> were sum-
moned. 244 were challenged for cause, and but 18
peremptorily. 54 were excused by the Court, and of
the number summoned, those not above enumerated
failed to appear.
   The prisoner and jury were required to rise and
listen to the reading of the indictment; at the con-
clusion of which, the jury were locked up for the
night, White was remanded, and the Court to this
morning at 9 o'clock adjourned.
   ☞ The Counsel request all the witnesses to be
punctual in their attendance this morning, as the ex-
amination of witnesses will commence at 9 o'clock
precisely.

   M<small>AY</small> 13.—<i>Trial of Ezra White</i>.—This long ex-
pected event commenced at 9 o'clock in the morn-
ing. The prisoner was placed at the end of the
table fronting the jury, and the counsel were ranged
on either side. He maintained the same stolid
appearance which has characterized him through-

	...
   William H. Wright sworn on behalf of the prose-
cution, examined by the District Attorney.—I reside
at 62 Suffolk street, blacksmith by trade. At the
time of this fray, I was one of the city watchmen. I
was a chance man. It was on the night of the 13th
of <u>February</u>, 1839, as near as I can recollect. My
post was bounded from Pitt street, Grand street,
from there to Columbia; from there to Broome, and
back to Pitt street. <u>Gaffrey</u>'s house was on the
south east corner of Broome and <u title="Willett">Willer</u> street. (The
witness describes the house.) There is a door open-
ing in each street. I think I came on at 12 o'clock
that night. There was a dance at <u>Gaffrey</u>'s house;
there were many persons going from and coming to
the house; they seemed lively at first, and more
lively at last. It was quite in the street; there was
no quarrelling in the house; I was by the house a
number of times; the noise was the noise of jollity,
not of quarrelling. There was nothing more there
than the noise usually heard on Saturday nights. <u>I
I</u> came to the corner between one and two, as I heard
a noise there. The door up <u title="Willett">Willet</u> street was open,
and there appeared to be trouble there. There
were two or three on the stoop, as near the door as
they could stand. As I stepped on the <u title="stoop">stoup</u>, they
were in struggle as it seemed, with those inside.
<u>Samuel</u> Stark jumped off the stoop; two more stood,
the one inside, the other in the door fighting. One
inside seemed trying to push the other out, to the
best of my recollection. As soon as I stepped up, I
pushed the one on the stoop off, and the other came
out. I shut <u>Gaffrey</u>'s door; I told them to keep the
door shut, and then wheeled on through my walk.
I know three of them; I knew them by sight; one
was <u>Joseph</u> Stark, Ezra White and <u>Richard</u> Stark.
I have heard their names since; I went up to Joseph
Stark, advised him to go away, for the men inside
were in liquor, Joseph Stark said to me, <u id="Herald-1841-05-14-Ezra-Knock-Down">“Wright,
go away, I'll soon knock down some of them.”</u> I
told him that if he did not go away immediately, I
would rattle for assistance, and take him to the
watchhouse. At this time both the doors of <u>Gaf-
frey</u>'s house were shut. As I spoke, we stood near
the corner of the street; Joseph Stark went on. The
other young men stood very near to the corner.
(The witness here describes from a diagram the ex-
act situation.)
   Stark stood at the near corner of Broome and Wil-
lett; he was a little way below the house. The
walk was about six feet, and he was about the cen-
tre. <u>Lemuel</u> Stark was a little round the corner in
Broome Street, and White stood near him, I spoke
loud to Joseph; the others could hear; they were
about eight or nine feet from Joseph Stark. The
stoop went round the house; it was about a step up.
I do not remember any thing of it; it was boards, I
believe. The floor of the store went up about a foot
higher, as near as I could judge. After speaking to
Joseph Stark, I went up Willett street; he went to-
wards the rest of them; as I went I heard some one
go up on the stoop; I looked round, and saw Ezra
White with his hand upon the door; that was the
Willett street door; the two doors lock together on
a post; on seeing that I started for the door, and
White let go of it. One man stood with his back
to the Broome street door, very near to the post.
White made motions with his hand; he struck the
man some where about here (the abdomen); there
was a rush made by those inside; the second man
he struck pitched out head first, and I caught him
about the waist in my hands. I think there was se-
ven or eight crowding to get out; I let the man fall,
and gave the alarm rattle. Two or three watch-
men came; Mr. Loder was one, and I don't remem-
ber the name of the other. When I gave the alarm,
the four ran in every direction; White turned the
Broome street corner, and ran down the street to-
wards the river. I had a watchman's cap on; it
was a star light night; it strikes me that there was
some snow in the gutters, but I am not positive; I
do not remember whether it was cold; I think I had
an overcoat on; I think it froze a little during the
night. When the other watchmen came up, we
went into the house. The man who had fallen was
taken up by the people of the house, and was car-
ried in; I cannot tell whether he walked in on his
feet, or was carried in; I cannot say whether the
doors of the store were immediately closed or not.
The <u>watchman</u> came up directly after the alarm.
When I went in, one man was bleeding from the
forehead, and another one lay on the ground, bleed-
ing from the abdomen. I did not hear the man on
the floor speak; there was a good deal of excite-
ment. There was a third man, who I understood
was stabbed, and was carried away. Some one went
for a doctor; I staid there an hour, or an hour and a
half, I cannot say positively; I went away, and re-
turned in the morning; the man on the floor was not
dead when I left; when I went in the morning, I
found the man there dead; I heard his name that
night, but had not heard it before, they called him
Peter Fitzpatrick. At the time I saw this press at
the door, it strikes me that White had something in
his hand, but I cannot positively swear whether he
had or not; my impression is that he had, but my
memory is so poor that I <u>could swear</u> it. There
was a lamp lighted, and hanging over the counter.
I believe there was another light there; there was
a street lamp a little farther off. I saw the wound
when the Coroner came. I did not see it before.—
It was near the abdomen. I cannot say what it
was. I think it was a knife, or something of that
kind. I think it must have been a knife, but I cannot
swear positively.
   Cross-examined by Mr. Graham.—At that time I
was a chanceman. I used to average 3 or 4 nights
in a pay—that is, in a fortnight. Chancemen go to
occupy the place of some watchmen, who, for some
reason, is absent. I cannot tell how often I have
been examined; I think four or five times—once be-
fore the Coroner, once before the Police Justice,
once before the Grand Jury, and once upon the first
trial of this case. The Coroner heard me twice.
This is the sixth examination. I have at each ex-
amination given the same account as I now give, to
the best of my knowledge. On that night I was ab-
sent from 9 to 12. I had been there in the fore part
of the evening. The inmates of the house were
then pretty lively; they were dancing. I did not
see any one come out or go in there. I cannot
say that they were excited with liquor. There might
have been as many as 20. I saw them through a
small, square window. I heard them dancing.
   When I returned at twelve, they were not making
any more noise than is usual with them. I had
been past once, before the time when I saw White
there. I think I saw some young men standing near
the house before I came round at one or two. I
neither saw them go in <u>or</u> come out of the house.
They did not say anything; I do not think I should
know their faces. When I came up, there was
Lemuel Stark and Joseph and Ezra White standing.
<u>Gaffrey</u>'s friends seemed following them, White and
others, out of the house, <u>Gaffrey</u> stood right before
the door, and pushed the men inside back; they
were making towards the door; I do not think that
either of the three came out; as I stepped on to
the stoop, they stepped off. When White had hold
of the knob of the door, the others rushed up to his
assistance. The door opens out; he opened it with
his left hand. I was ten or twelve feet distant
from the door.
   [The witness was here severely cross-examined
as to his ability to see, from his situation, any blow
struck by Ezra White in the interior.]
   I stood in the middle of the side walk, up Willett
street. The three young men, with the prisoner,
rushed up, and commenced striking and fighting
the inmates, as soon as White had opened the door.
I had never seen Fitzpatrick before. After Fitzpa-
trick came out, the crowd followed; I thought he
was pushed out by the crowd inside; he was picked
up, and carried inside; I did not see him after he
was taken in, until I saw the man lying on the floor;
I did not see the man's face so as to recognise him
again.
   By the Court—I supposed <u>Delaney</u> to have been
the man who was first struck by the door. I never
saw him and Fitzpatrick together.
   By Mr. Graham—When I went in, nothing par-
ticular transpired that I recollect. I heard some re-
marks like this from the inmates, “Watchman!
watchman! keep out, this is only a family concern.”
It was said by some of <u>Gaffrey</u>'s friends; there was
something said like this, “Go out, go out! you are
not wanted here.” I did not go out immediately.
   Mr. Graham read, from the evidence presented on
the former trial, that part where witness deposed
that he immediately went out.
   Witness—If I said so, it was the truth; I do not
recollect the circumstance now.
   Mr. Graham again read from report of the former
trial, where witness says, I can't say that I saw any
body carried into the house.
<d>[Col.4]</d>
   Witness—If it is so there, I suppose that is the
way I <u title="testified">tesified</u>.
   Mr. Graham again reads. Witness says that is
correct.
   Witness—Last week I was in Rochester; I had
business there; I did not know the trial was coming
on. When this case was tried before, I went away;
I had business away; I was back just in time to be
examined. When we went into the house, there
was a good deal of loud talking. The people were
rushing out in a rage, using some rash talk, I don't
know what.
   Mr. Graham proposes to ask the witness whether
he made certain statements before Justice Taylor.
Objected to by the District Attorney. Objection
overruled.
   Witness—I stated before Justice Taylor that I had
walked ten or twelve feet along Willett street; that
I saw White strike at some person inside with some-
thing which I saw glisten, but could not say whe-
ther it was a knife or dirk; that several men imme-
diately rushed out after, the first blow was struck by
White; that White struck again, and jumped round
the corner striking right and left. I also stated that
I did not see White seized by any one from the
house. The men rushed out of the door when this
man fell.
   Direct examination resumed.—I cannot say that I
have any distinct recollection as to whether the
thing that was in his hand glistened. I should not
like to say positively. Lemuel Stark is a lame man
—he limps. I do not remember to have heard
White say any thing when he thrust his hand in at
the door. The man who was stabbed in the abdo-
men was the second man. As the man who fell came
out of the house, I saw Ezra White strike him some-
where about the head. I thought the man was injured
when he fell. Whether it was this man, or some one
else, I cannot tell. As soon as he was struck the
rush pushed him out. He was hurt, I should think,
from the blow, not from his fall. He did not fall
head-foremost on the pavement. I think I heard
some one say “I am stabbed;” but whether it was
the man who fell or not, I cannot say. I only saw
one man on the floor; he was <u>laying</u> on his back,
with a pillow <u>on</u> the head. The other man had
something round his head. I saw White strike the
man who fell. I saw no one else struck.
   Cross-examination resumed.—I would not like to
swear now that I saw a weapon gleaming. I think
when the other watchmen came up I stated that
some one had been stabbed. I am not certain about
it. I do not recollect my reason for going out of the
house when the inmates told me.
   Mr. Graham.—Then you left the house, after you
knew some one had been stabbed? You would have
left a house even if you knew a murder had been
committed?
   Mr. Whiting.—He doesn't say so—a man might
be stabbed without being killed.
   The examination of the witness here closed, hav-
ing occupied a space of three hours and a half.
   Mr. Graham here read Wright's deposition before
Justice Taylor.
   Charles Fitzpatrick, a physician, residing at 82
Sheriff street, attended at Gaffney's—he was sent
for, and saw Fitzpatrick. He found the wound on
the lower part of the abdomen. When he saw the
man, he was in a dying state, incapable of <u title="deglutition">delutition</u>.
The wound seemed to have been inflicted by an
edged instrument; he thinks it was such a wound as
would be likely to produce death. On the cross-ex-
amination, witness stated, that he was not the first
physician called in; he did not probe the wound; it
extended upwards, from the bottom; death from
such a wound takes place from the effusion of blood.
I think I got there, to the best of my recollection,
between 12 and 1 o'clock.
   Walter <u title="Pugsley (elsewhere)">Payley</u> is a physician and surgeon. He
was called to Gaffney's house between two and three
—saw Fitzpatrick lying on his back, with something
under his head, naked, all but the cloth that was over
him. The wound was in the groin. I made the ex-
amination before Dr. Fitzpatrick. I inserted my fin-
ger into the wound, and I do not think that was cal-
culated to give a different direction to the wound. I
administered some stimuli.
   From the character of the wound, I should think
it unlikely he would live for two hours. The wound
of <u>Delany</u> was just above the navel. I should have
considered it a dangerous cut.
   Cross-examined.—I do not think any artery was
wounded in Fitzpatrick; it seemed to be venous
blood. The man did not bleed when I left. I left
orders for the pressure to be continued. I think if
proper stimuli had been supplied, and he had been
attended to, his life might have been saved. There
was some coagulated blood in the wound. The next
thing I heard of the man was that, he was dead.—
That wound could not have been given by a man
standing by the door and stabbing upwards. If a man
was standing a little lower, it would be still more im-
possible.
   Direct examination resumed—I thought there was
blood and life enough in the man to make it possi-
ble that he might be saved. The extremities were
cold. I judged from the man's appearance that he
had been intoxicated. I understood that he was
drunk, or crazy; so the man said who kept the
house. Gaffney said that there were two men who
did the mischief; a short man and a tall one.
   Christopher Dunlady deposed that he was at Gaff-
ney's house on the night. It was on the 13th of <u>Ja-
nuary</u>, I think. I went there about 9 o'clock; Gaff-
ney invited me there; I came out about 1 o'clock. I
heard them say that people were outside. Fitzpa-
trick came in and said he had a desperate kick or
wound in the groin. He threw himself across me,
and I stretched him on the floor.
   He had refused to drink awhile before. After he
was stabbed, he mentioned my name and his wife's.
There were three or four boys there in the fore part
of the evening, but they behaved themselves peace-
ably. I did not see White to know him.
   Cross-examined.—There were about twenty per-
sons at Gaffney's; I saw a man all besmeared with
blood, come in after Fitzpatrick; it was about half-
past two or three o'clock when Fitzpatrick came in;
I saw some persons drinking at the counter; we
drank gin; I saw no one drink there; he was stand-
ing on his feet, his hands over where the wound was;
he was dressed in a frock coat; the wound went
through all.
   Edward Durham, another witness, testified as to
the nature of the company at Gaffney's. He found
a quarrel going on. <u title="There">there</u> was a man with Fitzpa-
trick a little in the door; I took hold of him, and
said they should have no muss there. The landlord
came up; I heard a <u title="scuffle">scufflle</u> at the door, and the
landlord finally got it shut; as I went to the door,
Fitzpatrick passed me by; Gaffney got the door shut,
and it was pulled open by some one; at the time
Fitzpatrick went out, several more went out as far
as the threshold. I was going when Fitzpatrick
passed me by; I was before on the point of going
into the house, when the man stabbed me; when
Fitzpatrick passed me by, he was stooping, as if he
had been badly hurt; I believe Fitzpatrick went out
of his own accord; there were two others <u>cut</u>; I
think when I was stabbed, I was outside of the door
on the stoop. I do not know who struck me.
   Cross-examined—Some of the men drank freely;
the bar was open, and there was frequently liquor
brought into the back room; the Willett street door
was open when Fitzpatrick went towards it, to go
out; as I turned to go in, I saw Fitzpatrick, and I
received my stab; there was no person carrying
Fitzpatrick in. I did not see him either stabbed or
struck; I am distinct in my recollection that I saw
Fitzpatrick go out; I did not see anybody help him;
he moaned when he passed me; I cannot tell whe-
ther the door was opened from the outside or
inside; it was wide open; it is my opinion that a
few more went out at the time that Fitzpatrick did.
   At this point of the case the Court took a recess.
   The foregoing are all the material points elicited
on the part of the prosecution. Only two witnesses
were called for the defence.
   The counsel commenced summing up about 8
o'clock, and at midnight the case went to the jury.

<d>[Col.5]</d>
			<b>City Intelligence.</b>
	...
   M<small>ADAME</small> R<small>ESTELL</small>.—Some very erroneous reports
have been circulated respecting the bail of this cele-
brated feminine <u title="savant">savan</u>. We have obtained a sight
of the office documents connected with her libera-
tion, and collected therefrom the following facts:—
   The accused was brought before the Recorder on
Friday, for the purpose of tendering bail. Her coun-
sel prepared to deposite in the hands of the Record-
er, or the Clerk of the Court, or the Chamberlain of
the city, the sum of $3,000, the same to become for-
feit to the people, if Caroline Lohman did not ap-
pear to take her trial. His Honor said that he had
great doubts of the legality of such a procedure, and
that he should not consent to receive such a depo-
site, or to sanction it on the part of others.
   Mr. Jordan, the counsel for Madame Restell, then
proposed that the money should be placed in the
hands of <u>Thomas L. Braynard</u>, of No. 7 Hammond
street, who should assign the same to him, and that
he, Mr. Jordan, should give a certificate of such as-
signment to the Recorder. The same sum to be-
come forfeit to the people if Caroline Lohman did
not appear to take her trial.
   The arrangement was deemed bo be satisfactory,
and the Recorder then made the two sureties justi-
fy in the sum of $<u>6</u>,000 each. The names attached
to the bail bond are <u>Thomas L. Braynard</u>, of No.7
Hammond street, and Charles Lohman, of 148
Greenwich street.
   By another document attached to the assignment,
it would appear that <u>Braynard</u> named the sum of
$10 as his fee for this fair business transaction.

			<b>Oyer and Terminer.</b>
  Present, Judge Edwards, Alds. Purdy and Benson.
   M<small>AY</small> 14.—<i>Trial of Ezra White</i>.—The Court met
at 10 o'clock yesterday (Friday morning), and D.
Graham summed up the case in a most brilliant,
eloquent and affecting speech of four hours' dura-
tion on the part of the prisoner. At the close of
Mr. Graham's peroration, there was hardly a dry eye
in the Court room.
   The Attorney General of the State replied to Mr.
Graham on the part of the people. His Honor,
Judge Edwards, gave the case to the jury in a charge
of half an hour's duration, in which he dwelt much
on the inutility of jurors troubling themselves with
the consequences of any verdict they might find.
   The jury retired about 3 o'clock, P. M., and at 6
o'clock they came into Court to ask the Judge if they
could, under the indictment, find White guilty of
manslaughter. His Honor immediately read a por-
tion of the Revised Statutes to the jury, and ruled
that it was either competent for them to convict, to
acquit, or to find a verdict of manslaughter in the
third degree. The jury were again locked up, and
<u>at 10 o'clock returned into Court with a verdict.
hours; and then, being unable to agree, the Court</u>
gave them some supper and ordered them to be lock-
ed until they could agree on a verdict. At midnight
they had not agreed, and it was reported that nine
were for an acquittal and three for a conviction.
   N. B.—Throughout yesterday the Court was
crowded to excess, and the Special Deputies of the
Sheriff seemed anxious to exclude the bar and the
press from access to the Court. One loafer of the
name of Brady, while in a state of intoxication,
committed two or three assaults, for which he ought
to suffer some.

tion on the part of the prisoner. At the close of
Mr. Graham's peroration, there was hardly a dry eye
in the Court room.
   The Attorney General of the State replied to Mr.
Graham on the part of the people. His Honor,
Judge Edwards, gave the case to the jury in a charge
of half an hour's duration, in which he dwelt much
on the inutility of jurors troubling themselves with
the consequences of any verdict they might find.
   The jury retired about 3 o'clock, P. M., and at 6
o'clock they came into Court to ask the Judge if they
could, under the indictment, find White guilty of
manslaughter. His Honor immediately read a por-
tion of the Revised Statutes to the jury, and ruled
that it was either competent for them to convict, to
acquit, or to find a verdict of manslaughter in the
third degree.
   At eleven o'clock a message was brought into
Court that the jury had agreed. The Judge, Coun-
sel, Reporters, and most of the spectators had de-
parted, so that at the time the room was nearly de-
serted, except Ezra White, who occupied his usual
seat at the table, and when the officer communicated
the fact of the jury having agreed he did not betray
any emotion, nor make any sign of either joy or sor-
row. Messengers were despatched in all directions
to hunt up their Honors the Judges, who seemed to
be of opinion that the jury could not agree, and had
wended their ways home to bed. Considerable time
elapsed before the Court was re-organized, and then
the jury having all answered to their names, and the
prisoner being told to stand and look upon the jury,
the Clerk put the usual question—“Gentlemen of the
jury, how say you, is Ezra White, the prisoner at the
bar, guilty or not guilty”?
   Foreman—“Guilty of manslaughter in the third
degree, and we unanimously recommend him to
the mercy of the Court.”
   The soaplocks set up a tremendous shout of ap-
plause. David Graham and Hawkes Wright shook
hands with their client, and the Court was then ad-
journed.

   E<small>ZRA</small> W<small>HITE</small>.—The trial of Ezra White, charged
with the murder of Peter Fitzpatrick, on the night
of the 13th of February, 1839, was brought to a
close yesterday afternoon about three o'clock. The
presiding judge then delivered his charge, and the
jury retired. After being out several hours, the
jury returned into court, stating that they could
not agree upon a verdict and asking to be dis-
charged. They were remanded to their room by
the court, where they remained until about one
o'clock, when they came to an agreement as to
their verdict. It was announced to the court as
follows: “Manslaughter in the third degree, and
unanimously recommending the prisoner to the
mercy of the court.” The counsel in this case
were Willis Hall, Attorney General, and J. R.
Whiting, District Attorney, for the people; David
Graham, Jr. and Wright Hawkes, for the prisoner.

<d>[Col.5]</d>
strayed away from the vessel, when a man named James Coch-
rane volunteered as his companion, and contrived to rob him of
$14—all the money he had. The twain then entered the por-
ter-house of James Gill, who was from home, but whose wife
attended, and to whom <u title="Galway (later)">Galloway</u> stated he was sick and wished
to lie down, which he was suffered to do. He then stated to
Mrs. Gill that he had been robbed, who told her husband of it
when he returned. Cochrane, who pretended to be the friend
of Galloway, then wished Gill to examine a sore he said he had
on his side, and Gill, in so doing, discovered something under
Cochrane's arm, which, on taking it out, proved to be the same
$14 Galloway had lost, and was identified by means of the let-
ter K. which was marked on each bill. Officers Hilliker and
Hans, being sent for by Gill, arrested Cochrane, who was taken
before Justice Palmer and sent to prison.

pledged it to J. Jackson, corner of Forsyth and Grand-streets,
for $2. Mr. Jackson having communicated the fact to Officers
Hilliker and Hans, they succeeded in arresting Brennan, who
was taken before Justice Palmer and committed to prison to

   “THE MORAL CHARACTER OF NEW-YORK.”
   If the Father of Evil ever laughs, as he has been said to
do, at the 'fantastic tricks' of his practiced and adroit auxil-
iaries, he certainly must have enjoyed himself in looking over
the leading article in <i>The Sun</i> yesterday morning. That
depraved and filthy sheet, which has forced itself into a wide
circulation by systematically pandering to the lowest appe-
tites and most perverted tastes of the community—which has
never missed an opportunity to excite and profit by the fools'
wonder which gloats over accounts of monstrous births, the
chewing of snakes, the galvanizing into life of dead malefac-
tors, and every thing else hideous, revolting and horrible—
that paper which has built its fortune upon publishing trials
for procuring abortion, loathsome details of obscene vice, and
every thing calculated to stimulate the most prurient cravings
for garbage—that paper, the Sun, actually has the effrontery
to congratulate the citizens of New-York on a signal improve-
ment in their morals, and to take to <i>itself</i> the credit of pro-
ducing it! Where can this impudence find a parallel?
   The Sun graciously admits the Public and Sunday Schools
of our City, its Bible and Tract Societies, &c. to a secondary
partnership with <i>itself</i> in producing this beneficent change!—
but it arrogates the lion's share of the glory. We suspect
these Schools and Societies will not appreciate the honor in-
tended them. “To the cheap and independent press”—
[meaning itself, for it has never allowed any other, except
possibly the Herald, to possess either independence or merit]
—“belongs the <i>highest honor</i> in this good work.”!!!
   We are curious to know whether the Sunday Schools and
Bible Societies, which are so graciously admitted to the po-
sition of humble but useful auxiliaries of The Sun in the great
work of moral reformation, are to take a share in the credit
of introducing Madame Restell so favorably and <u title="thoroughly">thorougly</u> to
the public as The Sun through the last two years has done,
and of the other fearfully demoralizing advertisements and
puffs which it has so constantly and profusely vomited upon
the community. According to The Sun's published code of
morality, the Editors and Publisher of that sheet are no whit
responsible for the indecency or depravity of any article in
their columns, if they are only <i>paid for</i> inserting it; so we
presume the credit of this portion of their missionary labors
will not be worth sharing.

   C<small>OURT OF</small> O<small>YER AND</small> T<small>ERMINER</small>.—Before Judge Edwards
adn Aldermen Benson and Purdy.
   <i>Sentence of Ezra White</i>.—This prisoner was brought into
Court on Saturday morning to receive sentence, which the Dis-
trict Attorney moved should then be passed upon him. He ap-
peared quite composed and apparently indifferent to the proceed-
ing of the Court in his case; and, when asked what he had to
say why the judgement of the law should not be pronounced
against him, replied, “Nothing.”
   Judge Edwards then addressed the prisoner at considerable
length, and stated in substance that, after a fair and impartial
trial, he had been convicted of the crime of manslaughter in the
3d degree in causing the death of Peter Fitzpatrick by stabbing.
Three others (he continued) had been stabbed and wounded also
on the same occasion, and doubtless by the hand of the prisoner.
Fitzpatrick, the victim of the prisoner's violence, was now <u title="mouldering">mould-
dering</u> in his grave, and his wife and children were thrown upon
the cold charities of an unfeeling world, and left, perhaps, in a
state of great destitution by his means. His Honor then spoke
of the habits and mode of life of the prisoner and his compan-
ions, who had indulged in vicious courses and led lives of dis-
order and depravity, that had resulted in the death of one mur-
dered man. He said, to deter those companions from their per-
sistance in such courses the law would exert its authority and
punish to the utmost extent allowed, notwithstanding the recom-
mendation to mercy of the jury. The Court said they could see
no mitigation circumstances in the case, and accordingly sen-
tenced the prisoner to 4 years' imprisonment at hard labor in the
State Prison at Sing Sing. He was then remanded to prison,
and the Court adjourned for the term.

<d>[Col.5]</d>
			<b>Oyer and Terminer.</b>
Before Judge Edwards, and Aldermen Benson and Purdy.
   M<small>AY</small> 22.—<i>Sentence of Ezra White</i>.—This being the last
day of the term, Ezra White was brought into court to
receive sentence for occasioning the death of Peter Fitz-
patrick, which the jury on the second trial reduced to
manslaughter in the third degree, accompanied with a
recommendation to mercy. White remained in the same
state of unconcern which has ever characterized him,
since the commission of the atrocity, for which he has
gained such notoriety; but his bloodless countenance
would occasionally brighten when receiving the cares-
ses of his counsel, Mr. Alderman Graham. Having been
placed at the bar,
   The District Attorney called for the judgement of the
Court and of the law upon the convicted homicide.
   The Clerk, in the prescribed form, asked the prisoner
what he had to say why judgment should not be pro-
nounced upon him according to law? and
   The Prisoner, bowing to the Court, replied “Nothing.”
   Judge Edwards then passed the sentence of the Court
in the following terms:—
   E<small>ZRA</small> W<small>HITE</small>,—You have been convicted of manslaugh-
ter, in causing the death of Peter Fitzpatrick, and in the
circumstances of that case the court can discover no-
thing of a mitigating character. It appears that at the
time you approached him, and gave him the mortal blow,
he was not in a hostile attitude, but was quietly standing
on the pavement or adjoining the door-way, and there
approached him and applied the fatal weapon. It further
appears that another man, standing there at the same
time, received a wound in the head, and from the circum-
stances attending that case, I entertain no doubt that that
blow was inflicted by yourself. It also appears that two
other men were stabbed the same night, about the same
time; from whom those wounds were received does not
appear by any positive and direct testimony; the circum-
stances, however, attending the whole case, fairly warrant
the conclusion that they received them from you. It may
be that two of them were wounded at the time the affray
took place, when, according to the testimony of the wo-
men, you were acting on the defensive, and defying any
one to approach you; but the very row was created by
yourself, by your putting your hand within that door, and
moving it about in a manner which left no doubt that
you were endeavoring to apply that knife to the inmates.
That aroused their indignation, and the wounds were in-
flicted under those circumstances—consequently you
have neither justification nor excuse. Taking, then, the
case altogether, it is fairly inferable that you applied that
deadly knife to four individuals, one of whom sunk under
your arm, and now lies mouldering in the grave. For
this offence you have been convicted—for this offence
you are now arraigned to answer before this tribunal;
and it now only remains for the Court to say, under all
the circumstances of the case, what shall be the punish-
ment. The deed has been done—the deceased man lies
in his grave—his wife you have made a widow, and his
children fatherless. The facts of this case have gone
forth to the whole community, and the entire communi-
ty is waiting to see in what estimation a court of justice
holds offences of this description, and what punishment
the Court sitting here, as the administrators of the law
and the protectors of society, will feel to be their duty to
award. We should be recreant to our duty, if on this oc-
casion we were to drop the sword of justice—if we failed
to check, by the sentence of the law, ruthless violence like
yours—and if we extended any thing like lenity to an
individual standing before us in circumstances like
yours. If we look beyond that transaction, we see no-
thing to call for mitigation. We know not your general
character—you have not put that in issue, but we have
too much reason to fear that your habits are bad. This
offence, for which you have now to answer, was com-
mitted about half-past two o'clock in the morning. You,
with others, were rioting about at that unusual hour of
the night; and when you were requested to disperse,
one of your associates had the audacity to say to the offi-
cer, <a class="l" href="#Herald-1841-05-14-Ezra-Knock-Down">“I wish you would go, and then we will have a
knock down.”</a> Characters of this description have long
infested this community; there are too many young men
who have broken loose form the restraints of both parents
and masters, and it becomes necessary that they be curb-
ed and restrained in their riotous course, as well for
their own good as for the peace and safety of society. It
is therefore an act of humanity to them, as well as of pro-
tection to the community, that we enforce the extreme
penalty of the law for their and your correction. They
will then see in what estimation such conduct is held by
the Court, and what punishment they may fear when
called to answer for their offences.
   The jury, to be sure, have recommended you to mercy;
but the power and the duty of fixing your sentence has
been vested by the government in the Court. Recom-
mendations of juries are always entitled to respectful
consideration from the Court; but the Court, after giv-
ing them all due consideration, is not bound to surrender
its power and its judgment on the subject to the hands of
juries. This is especially the case here. We can see
nothing to alter our judgment, or to induce us to recede
from the views we have taken. Although the punish-
ment inflicted upon you may be severe, yet if you have the
sensibility which is common to our nature, and you are
not sunk below the level of humanity, this punishment
will be light and trifling, when compared with the re-
morse of your own conscience. In the course of nature
you have many years before you; but you never can
relieve your conscience from the accusation that Peter
Fitzpatrick, by your hand, lies mouldering in his grave,
and that you have turned his wife and children on the
cold charities of the world. That this reflection may
have a salutary effect upon you, is the sincere wish of
the Court. This, however, is a concern between your-
self, your conscience, and your Creator; but the court
is desirous that what little has now been said may make
a durable impression upon your mind.
   As regards the Court, our duty here is to enforce the
law, and in such a way as will most effectually extend
protection to the community at large. With these views,
the Court feels bound to go to the full extent of the pun-
ishment which the law allows. And I here remark,
that so far as my judgment is concerned, if the discretion
vested in the Court had enabled us to add many years
beyond the period to which we are limited, I should feel
myself in duty bound, not only to the government, but to
the community, which looks to the law and to courts of
justice for redress and for protection, to inflict that far-
ther punishment upon you. Unfortunately, our power
is limited, and the period we can fix is restricted to four
years. Your sentence, therefore, is, that you, Ezra
White, be imprisoned in the State Prison, at Mount
Pleasant, and kept to hard labor for the term of four
years.
   The prisoner resumed his seat, and entered into a con-
versation with Mr. Wright Hawkes, one of his counsel,
with a joyous unconcern, as though he were the least in-
terested spectator in the Court.
   At the close of the proceeding, White was handed over
to A. M. C. Smith, the Deputy Sheriff, and sent up to Sing
Sing in the afternoon boat.

   C<small>OURT OF</small> O<small>YER AND</small> T<small>ERMINER</small>.—S<small>ENTENCE
OF</small> E<small>ZRA</small> W<small>HITE</small>.—We are indebted to the Sunday
Mercury for the following excellent condensation
of the proceedings in the Court of Oyer and Ter-
miner on Saturday:
   Ezra White, convicted of killing Peter Fitzpat-
rick, was brought up to receive sentence. On the
bench were Judge Edwards and Aldermen Purdy
and Benson. The court room was full but not
crowded.
   At the opening of the Court, the District Attor-
ney called for the sentencing of Ezra White, and
the Clerk of the Court, Mr. Vandervoort, then cal-
led upon the prisoner to say why the Court should
not proceed to pass sentence upon him.
   White stood up at the foot of the long table that
runs in front of the bench, motionless, and with
but a slight exhibition of feeling. He said noth-
ing. By his side were his counsel, Messrs. David
Graham and Wright Hawkes.
   Judge Edwards then proceeded to deliver his
sentence. He commenced by stating that the Court
had discovered nothing in the circumstances that
attended the commission of the offence, for which
White now stood up to receive the sentence of the
Court, of a mitigating character; for at the time
of the killing of Fitzpatrick, he was not in a hos-
tile attitude towards any one. And so with regard
to the man who received a wound in his head,
which wound the Court entertained no doubt, had
been inflicted by White. And circumstances fair-
ly warranted the conclusion that the two other
men who were stabbed, received their wounds
from the same hand. The row was created by your-
self, said the Court, and with deadly knife, four in-
dividuals were that night stabbed by you, one to the
death, and his mortal remains are now mouldering
in the grave. The Court then spoke in reproba-
tory terms of the reckless and rowdy conduct of
White and his associates—of the fact that the whole
community was now watching to see what punish-
ment the Court would inflict upon him, and it then
intimated to the prisoner that no lenity could be
shown an individual standing before them as he did.
White's general character was then spoken of—the
fact that his own counsel had produced no evidence
of its goodness on the trial, and of the necessity
that now existed, of restraining the riotous and
rowdy conduct of such as he. For this purpose,
said the Court, the law puts forth its power on this
occasion, to let the class of young men to which
you belong know, that punishment sooner or later
awaits them.
   The fact of the jury having recommended the
prisoner to mercy was next alluded to—a recom-
mendation to which we cannot yield, said the
Court. It was hoped that, as he had many years
before him, being but a young man, this would be
a lesson to him, and have a correcting effect upon
him as upon others. And it was with this view—
the effect upon others—that the Court felt it to be
its bounden duty to sentence him to the full extent
of the law; and if it had any regret, it arose out of
the fact that the law was too limited.
   The prisoner was then sentenced to the prison of
Mount Pleasant, Sing Sing, for the term of four
years, during which to be kept at hard labor.—

<b>Diabolical Attempt to Destroy the National
			Theatre.</b>
   About six o'clock last night, the National Thea-
tre was discovered to be on fire in eight different
places, and under such circumstances as to leave no
possible doubt that the whole was a wicked and ma-
licious attempt to destroy that beautiful edifice,
with all the magnificent properties of the present
enterprising manager.
   It appears that Mr. <u>Oakey</u>, the celebrated panto-
mimist and comic dancer, who with others had as-
sembled to prepare for the evening's performance,
communicated to those around him that a smell of
something burning was very strong in the house; an
investigation was accordingly set on foot; first in the
property room, in which a quantity of bills and other
papers were found to be ignited, evidently for the
purpose of destroying the expensive properties of the
theatre. Mr. Wilson's private room was next ex-
amined, and here all his private papers and other
articles were discovered to be burning. Next,
fire was found under the stairs adjoining the box
office, and leading to Mr. Russell's room, where
	...
   Officers Gil. Hays and Welch were immediately
sent for, to investigate the origin of the fire, and dis-
cover the wickedly malicious scoundrel who could
have planned and executed so diabolical a crime,
and the result was, that the lamp-lighter to the
house—a man named Shiers—was taken into custo-
dy on suspicion. He had exhibited a revengeful
spirit in the course of the day, in consequence of
being refused “orders” for several of his friends,
and had threateningly said to a person connected
with the theatre, “there will be no performance to-
night.”
   Other circumstances tended to fix suspicion on
him, and he is now in the hands of the officers of
justice, by whom the whole matter will be thorough-
ly sifted.

   <i>Atrocious attempt to fire the National Theatre—
Timely discovery, and preservation of the building,
and arrest of the supposed incendiary</i>—About five
o'clock last evening, Mr. Burton, the manager, arriv-
ed from a visit to Philadelphia, and accompanied by
Mr. Wemyss, the stage manager, walked to the
theatre. To this fortunate circumstance may be at-
tributed the preservation of this beautiful structure.
Mr. Burton on entering the theatre by the rear en-
trance was met by Mr. <u>Okie</u>, one of the company,
who remarked, that he thought he smelt fire about
the house. Messrs. Burton and Wemyss were not
slow in taking the hint. They immediately com-
	...
   Mr. Russell, the Treasurer, with Mr. Glessing, his
assistant, had by this time commenced a search in
	...
While this search was in progress, a roll of paper was
thrown from an upper window into Leonard-street,
which was picked up by Mr. Smith, of the Refectory,
and which on examination was found to contain a
quantity of friction matches.
   In the Turkish Saloon below was found part of a
box of matches, which were found to correspond in
quality and appearance with those found in the street;
an attempt had also evidently been made to fire the
saloon. The author of this atrocious <u>villany</u> has
doubtless been discovered and is now in the tombs
awaiting an examination. His name is George
Shiers, an employee of the Gas Company, who as-
sisted in lighting the house at nights. This indivi-
dual had been frequently heard to threaten the es-
tablishment in consequence of a reduction of his sa-
lary, at which he expressed his indignation, saying
at the same time, “there'<u>l</u> be fire about the house,”
and yesterday he told one of the choristers that there
would be “no performance at the house to-night.”
Upon Shiers arrest, on searching his person, keys
were found which would afford him access to every
part of the house. He will be probably examined
this day.

   G<small>LENTWORTH'S</small> E<small>SCAPE</small>, &c.—This distinguished
youth, the companion in morals and in money, of
Messrs. Blachford, Bowen, and others “of that ilk,”
has escaped from the hands of a jury. This escape
was made on Saturday night, with some haste, and
after buttoning up his coat and breeches as fast as he
could.
   Yet the disagreement of the jury is a matter of
little consequence. The evidence is before the
country, and they have made up their opinion of the
“pipe-layers” beyond the power of all petty or penny
juries.
   But have we not come to a pretty pass in these
days? There is Eldridge in Philadelphia—he has
also escaped on his third trial, by the disagreement
of the jury. Let Madame Restell at once go to trial.
She cannot be convicted—nor can any person be
convicted in these halcyon days, but the poor devils
of loafers who steal a loaf to fill their bellies, or a
pair of breeches to cover them. The administra-
tion of justice is corrupt to the foundation. Politics
and banking have covered the whole land with im-
morality, licentiousness, crime and venality of all
kinds. The difference between the saint and the
scoundrel is gone for ever—they are both equal—
both fit for the State Prison or the State Legislature.
   We propose James B. Glentworth for the next
President—who's afraid?

   <i>Departure of Ezra White</i>.—This distinguished in-
dividual accompanied by A. M. C. Smith, Esq., left
the city on Saturday for his country residence in the
village of Sing Sing. Shortly after the leaving of
the steamboat Mr. White evinced considerable indis-
position, owing probably to his long confinement and
close application to business, during the few past
years. He however soon regained his wonted cheer-
fulness and apparent good health and so continued,
till his arrival at his place of destination.
   Upon reaching the retreat at Mount Pleasant a con-
sultation was had with the authorities, and it was
finally settled that Mr. White should amuse himself
for the next four years in the delightful employment
of <i>Carpet weaving</i>. Mr. Smith left him in excellent
spirits.

<m9><b><cl>C</cl>ASTLE	POINT	AND		THE		ELYSIAN
FIELDS.</b>—The delightful Pleasure Grounds at Hoboken
have been put in complete order, and, having been much improved,
are now open to visiters. The cool and shady walks, winding for a
long distance on the banks of the majestic Hudson, offer a pleasant
and refreshing retreat from the hot and dusty pavements of the city.
   The heights of Castle Point (which are still open to the public) com-
mand an extensive and beautiful prospect, embracing at a glance the
noble bay dotted with islands, and enlivened with vessels gliding in
every direction on its bosom; the city, with its numerous spires, and
the distant hum of its busy inhabitants; while the river, whitened
with sails, is lost in the distance beyond the towering palisades, pre-
senting altogether a scene lovely beyond description, and of its kind
unequaled.
   By a newly opened and well shaded walk, protected from the rays
of the sun by a grove of noble oaks, visiters may descend in a few
minutes to the Colonade, where, on moderate terms, are furnished re-
freshments of the best kind, and suitable to the season. The ferry-
boats have been comfortably refitted with awnings, &c. and leave Bar-
clay and Canal-streets every few minutes—the ferriage, as heretofore,
6½ cents. In no other part of the world, perhaps, can so rich a treat<!-- Looks like 3 dots (⠇ OR ⡆ OR ⋮) over "|", but the sign is clearly visible in Tribune-1841-08-07, &c. -->
be so easily obtained and at so trifling expense.		je2-2mis</m9>

   <i>Suit for Breach of Marriage Promise spoiled, and the
Lawyer done out of his Fees</i>.—On the 16th day of April last
a young Pearl-street Milliner named Jane ——— went to a
gentleman of the bar and wished to employ him to commence
a breach of promise of marriage suit against her defaulting
lover. She accordingly made affidavit that her <i title="ex-">ci devant</i>
lover, George ———, a clerk in a cotton broker's office in
Wall-street, had wooed her for nearly three years with the
avowed intention of making her his wife. That she kindly
received his attentions to the exclusion of all other admirers,
and that about seven months previous a reciprocal agreement
was entered into to become husband and wife, and that the
month of April of the present year was appointed as the pe-
riod when the nuptials were to be solemnized in due form of
law. That she went with George, her intended, about two
months before and selected and hired a house, for them, as
married people, to reside in; that furniture for it was pro-
cured and the wedding garments purchased, and at the in-
stance of her lover, the friends of the parties were invited to
hold themselves in readiness to appear and grace the nuptial
fete as their guests; but that on Sunday the 12th of April,
George, the lover, came with views far different from those
that have been stated, and bluntly informed his late lady-love
that he could not marry her, as he was attached to another
who more completely engrossed his affections; and that he
then left her and had not returned to redeem his plighted en-
gagements.
   Independent of this, which was sworn to before a commis-
sioner, she stated that George, after the purchase of the
furniture, had placed it in her possession, as he also had the
linen for a number of shirts he had left for her to make;
these he wished her to restore; but in the true spirit of an
insulted maiden, she declared that she would break the fur-
niture to pieces, and tear the shirts to tatters, rather than to
see them again in his possession. As a matter of course
they remained in her possession.
   After this demonstration of spirit, she applied to the law-
yer as above stated, and wished him to commence suit against
her treacherous lover for <i>non</i>-suiting her by his refusal to
wed. A letter was written by the counsel to George on the
subject, who sent a friend to her, requesting her not to pro-
secute. She, however, persisted, and resolved to let the law
light upon her former adorer, and a writ was issued for him
and damages laid at $5,000. She then returned to her coun-
sel, reported proceedings, and at his instance agreed to set-
tle the matter, and 'cry quit,' if he would pay her $200. She
returned the next day, said he had been to visit her and ex-
pressed a belief that he would marry her if she would consent
to be his. She returned again and informed her counsel that
her lover had agreed again to marry her, and soon after the
fates or the priest made them one—and the counsel heard
that they were married. He then wrote a letter to her as
Mrs. F. reminding her of her omission to pay him his fees
and costs accruing on the inchoate suit, but she replied with
much <i>sang froid</i>, that she was not Mrs. F. but had become
Mrs. G., and that he might go and whistle for his fees, and
get them as he could; and the result of the whole matter is,
that the lady has obtained a husband through the instrumen-
tality of the lawyer, and the lawyer has, by a mariage <u title="manoeuvre">ma-
nœuvre</u>, lost his fees, which illy <i>suits</i> his feelings and his
purse—and for which he will in all probability commence <i>suit</i>
against the defaulting wife and husband unless they are
speedily paid.

ter Biddy Brooks, who writes the epistolary twaddle
from New York, that appears in the National Intelli-
gencer, speaking of the trial of Glentworth, says:—
<m9>   <u title="Notwithstanding">Nothwithstanding</u> the District Attorney has parti-
cipated largely in this feeling [meaning political feel-
ing] he has, nevertheless, at times shown great mag-
nanimity, and completely exonerated Messrs.
Blatchford, Bowen, Draper, and Grinnell from all the
infamous charges which were put in circulation
against them.</m9>
   There is hardly a word of truth in this statement.
Mr. Whiting exonerated Mr. Grinnell, so far as to
believe that he was duped by the others, but both
Mr. Whiting and the public believe that Blatchford,
Bowen and Draper, are just as guilty of pipe-laying
as Glentworth. They furnished the money and
Glentworth only did the work.
			—————
   T<small>HE</small> N<small>EW</small> M<small>AYOR</small>.—Robert H. Morris, the new
Mayor, the great terror to pipe-layers, bids fair to
be one of the most efficient and popular we ever
had. Every body approves his message. In the po-
lice and peace-keeping department, he will be as
manly and prompt as Aaron Clark, who was one of
the best we ever had. We <u>dont</u> care a button for
the politics of either—we only value their good qual-
ities for governing our unruly city. The new May-
or will, no doubt, introduce many new reforms into
practice—particularly in relation to the cleanliness
of the streets—the police, &c.

death by hydrophobia last week, the Mayor has put
in force the dog law, and made several appointments
to the respectable office of dog-killer. Good.
   We have not heard whether the Rev. David Hale
has been appointed to office this year or not—but we
presume he will be. We would also request the
Mayor to appoint James Watson Webb and Charles
King to office at once—salary two dollars per day,
weapons included. They have been seeking office
for a long time, and almost ready to eat each other
up by the delay. We ask nothing for Colonel
Stone at present, he having been wisely provided for
in the State Lunatic Asylum. <i title="Praise to God">Laus Deo</i>.

Frederick County Bank, Maryland, now say that
they have received a letter from the robbers, offer-
ing to return the State stocks, &c. provided they
will say nothing further of the gold. No doubt of it.
These financial burglars have just discovered that
they robbed too much when they robbed their own
vaults of State stocks. Take them back by all
means. It is only another chapter in the farce of
self-robbery.

		<m8>Reported for the Courier & Enquirer.</m8>
   <i>Another Murder or Painful Suicide</i>.—The Coro-
ner was yesterday summoned to the house of a
Swede named John Roth, who kept a small grocery
or porter-house at <u>27</u> Mulberry street. Roth, it was
reported, had committed suicide by cutting his throat
with a razor. He was an uncommonly large athletic
man, of good habits, and to all appearances perfectly
sane and happy. He was found lying on the
floor of his room, over the bar room; his throat
dreadfully gashed; a razor lying on the table nearby;
and he quite dead.
   His wife stated, that a few moments before his
death, a man whom she did not know—said to be a
seaman on board the U. S. ship Dolphin—called up-
on him, and they together went to the room where
deceased was found. They remained together some
little time, when the strange man came down, called
for a glass of wine, which he drank; and as he was
in the act of leaving, coolly remarked, “By the way,
Mrs. Roth, do you know that your husband up stairs
has just cut his throat?”—when he left the house,
and Mrs. Roth hastened to convince herself of the
dreadful reality.
   Mrs. Roth also stated, that her husband had about
him when last she saw him a pocket-book containing
a considerable sum of money. Upon searching the
body, none of the property thus described could be
found.
   The Coroner, in view of this state of things, defer-
red holding the inquest till this day; and meanwhile
a search for the strange man was set on foot.

   <i>Atrocious Murder</i>.—About 2 o'clock on Tuesday,
the Coroner was summoned to the corner of 28th
street and 3d avenue, to an ante-mortem examination
on the body of a Mrs. Margaret Russell, who was
lying <i>in articulo mortis</i>, from a blow with an axe,
with which she had been struck by her husband,
Patrick Russell! On his arrival, the Coroner found
that the information was too true, and the ill-fated
woman was quite insensible; she was immediately
removed to the Bellevue Hospital, and the operation
of <u title="trepanning">trepaining</u> the skull, which had been horribly
fractured in the region of the temporal bone, was
performed by Dr. Hyslop in the presence of the
Coroner. No hopes however were entertained of the
woman's recovery.
   It appears that the brother of Mrs. <u>Russel</u>, from
whom her husband rented the house which he occu-
pied, had frequently threatened to turn them out of
doors, and that Russell had swore that he would kill
either his brother-in-law or his wife. About 12 o'-
clock, on Tuesday, Russell ordered two of his nephews
who lived with him to leave the room in which he and
his wife were, and on their doing so, the wretch im-
mediately seized an axe, and without saying a word,
with it felled his wife to the ground! His nephews
heard the blow and supposing that he was breaking
the windows, rushed into the apartment, and found
the unfortunate woman weltering in her blood and
apparently lifeless.
   The unfortunate woman survived till 11 o'clock
on Tuesday night when she expired. She was 36
years of age, a native of <u>Germany</u>, the mother of one
child by a former husband and of two by Russell.
<u>Russel</u> is 55 years of age, born in Ireland.
   The wretched husband fled and was pursued by one
of his own children, to the foot of <u>24</u>th street, where
he plunged into the East River and waded into the
water <u>up to his chin</u>. The little boy called for help,
and a Mr. <u>Cochran</u> and several other persons came
and secured him and had him committed to prison,
upper Police.
   The Coroner yesterday held an inquest on the
body of deceased, and the Jury rendered a verdict
that the deceased came to her death, in consequence
of blows inflicted by her husband, Patrick Russell.

   <i>Glentworth</i>.—We understand that J. B. Glentworth
wsa yesterday surrendered by his bail. We under-
stand that after much effort he succeeded in <u title="procuring">procu-
ing</u> bail anew, and that he is still at large.

   <i>Teeth</i>.—In the Common Pleas, yesterday, before
Judge Ingraham, a dentist named <u>Lemuel</u> Ross, re-
covered of Mr. Abijah Matthews, the sum of $63, for
a set of teeth furnished by the plaintiff. The bill of
particulars set forth in the declaration, was $188 37.
Before going to trial, however, $100 was thrown off,
and of the $88 37, remaining, the Jury gave the sum
above stated.

   <i>National Theatre</i>.—Justice Parker is still pursuing
the investigation, in the matter of burning of the
National Theatre. No new witnesses were discover-
ed or further progress made yesterday toward a solu-
tion of the mystery. Hurd, one of the suspected in-
cendiaries now in prison, was brought up, but refused
to answer any questions. Another attempt to ex-
amine him will be made this day.
   Mr. Burton has leased the spacious Hall in Wash-
ington Hall, corner of Broadway and Chambers-st.,
and has already commenced operations, in fitting it
up for the purpose of performing Vaudevilles and
other light warm weather entertainments.

   <i>More Murder in prospective</i>.—Just previous to the
closing of the Police Office last evening, a man in
great haste, rushed into the presence of Justice Mat-
sell and stated that a woman residing in Batavia st.
had given something from a phial to two children,
and had taken a quantity of the same herself, by
which the three had all been taken dreadfully sick.
A physician had been called who pronounced it a
case of poisoning. Officer Stanton was dispatched
to the scene of action to make the requisite inquiries,
but at last accounts had not returned to the office.
   The Coroner was also yesterday notified that the
body of an unknown man had been found floating in
the North River foot of Fulton st. and also that a
child had been drowned at the foot of 17th street,
East River—particulars not transpired.

   A Mr. Lessing, a very respectable, amiable man,
who keeps a grocery on the corner of 24th-street and
3d Avenue, was severely stabbed and cut in four or
five places by a drunken negro, on Monday night.

   C<small>ORONER'S</small> O<small>FFICE</small>—A<small>NOTHER</small> D<small>OMESTIC</small> T<small>RAGEDY</small>.—
On Wednesday, the Coroner proceeded to Bellevue Hos-
pital, to hold an inquest on the body of Margaret Rus-
sell, aged 36, who died the previous night from blows in-
flicted by her husband. It appeared that Patrick Russell
and his wife Margaret lived at the corner of 28th street
and 3d avenue, and that Margaret had occasional diffi-
culties with her husband, who was a man of violent tem-
per. About 11 o'clock on Wednesday morning the atten-
tion of the sister of deceased was aroused by a noise in
the room occupied by Russell and his wife, and on pro-
ceeding to the apartment, she found Mrs. Russell on the
floor bleeding profusely from a large wound on the right
side of the head. Another sister of the deceased was then
sent for, and in a few minutes the murderer was brought
in by some citizens, and the woman was removed to the
hospital, where she died.
   Rose Kelly, the other sister of deceased, deposed that
Margaret Russell was a native of <u>Ireland</u>, and had
been married to her present husband, Patrick, about six
years, by whom she had two children. She also had
one child by her first husband. Witness went into the
room at the desire of the last witness, and found the body
of the deceased as described by her.
   Edward McClaskey deposed that he was the son of the
first witness and was 12 years of age. He was at home,
at his mother's Tuesday morning, about 10 o'clock and
saw Patrick Russell, who appeared to be sober. He said
nothing but went to his room. Presently he came out
and witness heard a moaning in the room and told his
mother, who went with him to the room, and saw his
aunt lying on the floor bloody. At this time witness
could see Patrick Russell crossing by <u>28</u>th street towards
the East River, and he immediately started in pursuit of
him. Patrick only walked fast at first, but seeing wit-
ness after him he ran until he got to the river where
he waded in <u>as high as knees</u>. Witness hallowed
“stop that man,” but no one heard him at first.—
—He continued to make the alarm, but no one came to
assist witness; he told another boy to “watch that man;”
and then he ran to Mr. <u>Conklin</u>'s, and told them what had
happened; and they went and secured Patrick Russell,
who told them he would walk back if they would let
him, and they took him into the room to see his wife, and
then he was taken to the Upper Police Office. In answer
to questions put by the jury, this witness stated that, for
fifteen minutes before he saw Patrick go out, he heard a
knocking on the floor, which induced him to believe that
Patrick was breaking up the furniture. After taking the
testimony of the medical men, who had received the de-
ceased at the hospital. The jury found the following
verdict:—That Margaret Russell came to her death by
a blow or blows inflicted on her head by her husband,
Patrick Russell.
   A<small>NOTHER</small> H<small>OMICIDE OR</small> S<small>UICIDE</small>.—On Wednesday evening
about 5 o'clock, information reached the Coroner that a
man named John Roth, supposed to be a Dutchman, was
lying with his throat cut at his residence No. <u>27</u> Mulber-
ry street. Dr. Archer and Justice Matsell immediately
proceeded to the place, but it was thought prudent to post-
pone the inquest for a short time.
   The body of the deceased presented a most appalling
spectacle. He was an immense sized man, and he was ly-
ing on his back in a small back room completely deluged
with blood and gore. An open razor lay on a chair in the
room, but <i>some distance</i> apart from the corpse. The wound
in the throat was of the most decided character. The
trachea and arteries being completely severed, and death
must have been instantaneous. The wife of the deceased,
who is an Irish woman, says she was below in the bar
when one of her husband's friends came down stairs and
asked for a glass of wine, which she gave him. He then
told her that John had cut his throat, and desired her to
go up stairs. This man who is supposed to belong to the
U. S. brig Dolphin, then left the house, and it is said that
Roth must have had a large amount of money on his per-
son which cannot be found.
   Justice Matsell immediately sent officers in all direc-
tions to arrest the sailor, but up to the time of the office
closing he had not been heard of.
   D<small>ROWNING</small>.—A child was found drowned at the foot of
17th street. A man was found floating in the North
River, at the foot of Fulton street.
   In both cases verdicts of found drowned returned.
   A<small>NOTHER</small> M<small>YSTERY</small>.—Information reached Justice <u>Matsel</u>,
last night, that a woman and two children were likely
to die, in consequence of taking some deleterious drug
or other, either from accident or design. The family
was said to reside in Batavia street. An officer was dis-
patched to ascertain the particulars of the case, but he
did not return by this time of the office closing.
   L<small>IBEL</small>.—A man named John Leyden, said to be one of
the Collectors of the 6th Ward, was yesterday charged
with publishing libels in two of the penny papers, for
the purpose of defaming and maligning the character of
a juvenile lawyer, John C. McGrath. The collector was
held to bail.
   P<small>ETTY</small> T<small>HIEVES</small>.—The setting in of the warm weather
seems to have caused a whole swarm of petty thieves to
walk abroad, seeking for something to devour. Yester-
day about eight different charges were brought before
the police. First, Mike Reynolds, who stole a tin sauce-
pan—secondly, three little negro pests were charged
with picking pockets on the Five Points—Mary Dunn
stole a piece of calico—John M. Arminta stole a silk
handkerchief—Eliza Brown stole a piece of gingham,
and all were severally sent to the tombs.
			—————
		<b>Court of Common Pleas.</b>
		  Before Judge Ingraham.
   J<small>UNE</small> 2.—<i><u>Samuel</u> Ross vs. Abijah Matthews</i>.—This was an
action to recover the amount of a bill for dentistry, and for
services rendered to the defendant and his wife. The
bill of particulars amounted to $188 37, and included a set
of permanent teeth for the wife of the defendant and a set
of temporary teeth for himself. The permanent set for
the lady were put down at $100, but the plaintiff's coun-
sel abandoned this claim as untenable.
   For the defence, it was set up that the teeth were not
such teeth as a gentleman ought to have in his mouth,
much less such as he ought to pay for. That the masti-
cators were not good in color, deficient in ease, unable to
bear in the mouth, for more than half an hour at a time,
and had sundry other bad qualities about them.
   The plaintiff's counsel contended that the teeth were
as good as could be got at that price, and that the defend-
ant had promised to pay. The jury found for the plain-
tiff,<u title="Nothing!">				</u>

   C<small>ORONER'S</small> O<small>FFICE</small>.—An inquest was held on the
body of John Roth, who resided at No. <u>26</u> Mulberry
street, and was found on Wednesday afternoon with
his throat cut (<i>vide</i> Herald of yesterday) in the most
efficient manner. After a patient investigation, the
jury found that John Roth committed suicide while
in a state of mental derangement.
   The sailor who had been in company with Roth
a few minutes before the deed was done, was brought
before the jury, but nothing appearing against him,
he was discharged. It is proper to say that Roth's
pocket-book, with the money, was found in the bed,
so “poor Jack” was honorably acquitted of every-
thing except fright at the sight of blood.
   C<small>LUB</small> L<small>AW</small>.—At the request of Dr. C. H. Stillman,
of Fourth street, the coroner proceeded to Sheriff
street for the purpose of holding an inquest on a man
who received a severe blow from a watchman, about
ten days back, which produced such a severe injury
of the brain and spinal marrow, that notwithstanding
the best medical treatment, the patient died on Wed-
nesday. The name of the deceased was Edward
Fury, but no inquest was held, as Dr. Archer was
fully satisfied that the man had died from natural
causes.
   M<small>ORE</small> D<small>ROWNING</small>.—The firing of a salute in the
harbor of New York, is generally a sort of God send
to the Coroner, as the concussion in the air usually
causes two or three dead bodies to float on the sur-
face of the bay or the rivers. It is doubtful indeed
whether any city of equal population to New York,
even exhibits so large a proportion of drowned per-
sons in the course of the year, as our annals would
present. Yesterday afternoon the Coroner held in-
quests on two cases, one the body of a man at the
pier near Franklin market, which had lain many
days in the water, and was in a most terrible state
of decomposition. The other was a negro found at
the foot of James slip, supposed to be the body of
one Sally Jones, who committed suicide two nights
since.
   Information was also received at the Coroner's of-
fice that another body had been found.

—Yesterday Thomas Hurd was brought before Jus-

room at the police office, for examination, which re-
sulted as follows, which is copied verbatim from the

residence?
   A. I refuse to answer any question, my counsel,
John A. Morrill, Esq. being present.
   Hurd afterwards refused to sign the examination,
and the magistrate fully committed him for trial, in-
forming his legal advisers and all interested, that <i>no

the Tombs.
   Shiers was also brought out for examination, and

   This Court opened, for the June term, yesterday.
The calendar contains 21 new, 55 old—total 76 prison
cases.
   Eight grand jurors appeared upon a call of their
names. Those present were discharged for the day.
The absentees were severally fined each $25, and a
new panel was ordered for this day.
   A petit jury was formed, and <i>Daniel Boyle</i> and
<i>Hugh Burns</i> were put on trial on charge of highway
robbery, in having, on the 13th day of May last,
knocked down and robbed a Jew pedlar, named <u>Man-
nessah</u> Goldberg, of his pocket-book, containing a
considerable sum of money. The prosecution failed
to produce testimony sufficient to sustain the charge
of robbery, and the jury acquitted Boyle, and found
Burns guilty of assault and battery.

			FANNY ELSSLER.
   The theatrical gazettes of our City announce that Mlle.
Fanny Elssler—the <i>divine</i> Fanny, as she has been most im-
piously styled by her admirers—has consented again to irra-
diate our City with the light of her presence, after clearing
in her Southern campaign some $50,000 over her most lav-
ish expenditures, and that she will soon bless the longing
eyes of her idolaters with an exhibition of some of the most
brilliant and costly pirouettes that ever yet added grace to
the refinement or delicacy to the purity of New-York. An
adoring public will of course hold their dollars in hand, ready
for a rush pell-mell to the box-office.
   Now we do not propose at this time to enter generally upon
the question of the propriety and wholesomeness of theatri-
cal entertainments, but we desire to submit to the reputable
and virtuous W<small>OMAN</small> of New-York some considerations bear-
ing on the propriety and rightfulness of their countenancing
the career of Mlle. Elssler by appearing as spectators of
her performances.
   We entreat every true Woman of our city to lay aside
for one moment all preconceptions and prejudices relating to
Theatres, and steadily regard this matter in its naked aspect.
Let us suppose that a female of such character as Madame
Elssler's notoriously is—one who even had the common excuse
of necessity for a life of wantonness and shame—were to
advertise to deliver a Lecture to-morrow evening on some
interesting theme, which she was perfectly competent to elu-
cidate, how many reputable Women would think proper to
be among the number of her auditors? Could there possi-
bly be six? three? one?—But is the case better when the
heroine is deprived by her heaps of treasured wealth, her
every circumstance, from the horrible necessity of leading a
life of infamy—when instead of an unexceptionable Lecture,
she proposes to make such an exhibition of her powers and
her person as that of Madame Elssler—and when instead of
a decent lecture-room this exhibition is to take place with
other wantons in front of the maiden or matron spectator,
two drunkeries in the rear, and a public assignation-hall over
head? How far can these delicate concomitants be calcu-
lated to purify the atmosphere and justify the presence of
virtuous Women?
   We plead for Woman in this matter; and we ask those of
the sex who will be importuned to attend the performances
of Mlle. Elssler, to consider the consequences of compliance,
not to themselves merely, but to the cause of Virtue and
Purity universally. In the eyes of the mass of mankind,
whatever is hallowed by the presence of reputable Women
is virtuous, proper, commendable—at any rate as good as
they care for. What, then, must be the standard of female
virtue established in the minds of the masculine thousands
assembled to gaze on the revealings of the pirouette and the
cachucha, as they turn their eyes for a moment inquiringly
from the stage and meet the ardent, admiring gaze of intelli-
gent and reputable Women fixed approvingly, admiringly on
the voluptuous spectacle before them? Who does not re-
alize that the corrupt in soul will return with a keener zest
to their enjoyment, confirmed and emboldened in their innate
conviction that all virtue is but a decent hypocrisy or a cun-
ning calculation? Who can shut her eyes to the conviction
that the smiles, the cheers, the bravos bestowed upon this
gilded, glittering, shameless creature—the cast-off mistress
of half the titled libertines of Europe—are in truth ovations
to brazen harlotry and encouragements to persist in guilty
outrage of the laws of Society and of God? Who can fail
to realize that every cheer to this fallen spirit is in truth a
scoff at female virtue and an impulse to female degradation?
Women of New York! how many of you will countenance
by your presence and your plaudits the career of Fanny
Elssler?

   <i>Fatal Effects of the Hot Weather</i>.—In consequence
of the excessive heat which has prevailed for the past
two days, a number of deaths have occurred and ma-
ny persons have fallen down in the streets and have
been restored with difficulty.
   A laborer on the Croton Water Works, named Mi-
chael Egan, who arrived from Ireland only on Sun-
day week last, while employed near 42d street in a
state of profuse perspiration, drunk hastily of cold
water, and in a few minutes after fell down and al-
most instantly expired. His death took place about
5 o'clock on Tuesday afternoon. The Coroner's Jury
rendered verdict of death from drinking cold water.
   Another laborer, while at work yesterday, on the
8th Avenue, came to his death from the same cause.
The result of the Coroner's inquest has not yet trans-
pired.
   The Coroner also, yesterday held an Inquest at
Blackwell's Island, on the body of a wretched va-
grant named John McGinnis, who was the day pre-
vious committed as a vagrant for 6 months. He was
found dead in his cell. Verdict, death from delirium
tremens.

   C<small>OURT OF</small> S<small>ESSIONS</small>.—<i>Friday</i>.—Before the Recorder,
Judges Lynch and Noah, and Aldermen Lee and Pollock.
   In the case of James B. Glentworth, on whose behalf a
reduction of bail from $5000 to $500 was on Thursday ap-
plied for by his counsel, the Court stated that when the
amount of bail was originally fixed, there were seven indict-
ments against the accused for as many distinct offences.—
Subsequently six of those indictments had been disposed of
by demurrer; and only one remained on which the accused
had been tried, the jury being unable to agree. Every disa-
greement of a jury increased the legal presumption of inno-
cence; and the Court therefore deem it proper and right to
reduce the amount of bail from $5000 to $1000, in which
sum unexceptionable bail will be taken.
   The following sentences were then passed, viz.:
   Henry Taylor, colored man, convicted of manslaughter in

			<b>General Sessions.</b>
Present his Honor the Recorder, Judges Noah and
		Lynch, and two Aldermen.
   J<small>UNE</small> 11.—<i>In re James B. Glentworth at the suit of the
people</i>.—In this case the Recorder delivered the
opinion of the Court, on the motion made by Mr.
Glentworth's counsel, for a reduction of bail.
   His Honor said that at the time the bail was fixed
at $5000 there were seven indictments against the
defendant, that six of those were disposed of by the
Court, on <u title="demurrer">demurer</u>, in favor of the defendant, and
that on the other, the jury could not agree on a ver-
dict. The Court could not refrain from noticing the
fact that every disagreement of a jury increased the
legal presumption of the innocence of the accused,
and the Court, having all these circumstances before
it, would order the sureties in $5000 to be discharged,
on condition that the defendant found two good and
sufficient sureties in the sum of $1000, so as to ensure
his attendance in Court whenever he should be re-
quired to take a new trial.
   Mr. James S. Smith then asked for an order for
the Police Magistrates to take the bail, which their
Honors granted, on condition that the District Attor-
ney have due notice of the bail.
   His Honor directed the following convicts to be
paraded for sentence:—
   Henry Taylor, negro, convicted of manslaughter
in the third degree, in killing another negro, in the
month of April last.
   His Honor, the Recorder, adjudged the negro man
slayer to suffer for four years at Sing Sing, that being
the full extent of the law.
   Alexander G. Coxe, an ex-Major in the army of
Brigadier General Southerland, of Navy Island ce-
lebrity, convicted two terms since of obtaining goods
under false pretences, was directed to be placed at
the bar. Coxe, being asked the usual question, said
he was absent from the Court when the jury returned
their verdict, and he has no other knowledge of said
verdict except what he derived from the Clerk of the
Court, and he now objected to the verdict as illegal,
because recorded during his absence.
   He also denied the false pretences, and said he
had suffered an imprisonment of four months before
his trial.
   The Recorder said it could be of no use entering
on the merits of the case, because the jury had
passed upon the charge, and Coxe insisted on read-
ing two affidavits. His Honor, the Recorder, then
took a brief review of the circumstances under
which Coxe was convicted, and adjudged him to be
imprisoned in the city prison for thirty days.
   John <u>Ferdon</u> convicted of grand larceny, in steal-
ing a valuable case of umbrella silks, the property
of <u title="Gigenous in Herald-1841-06-09">Gigounr</u> & Co., was next put to the bar.
   The court adjudged him to the state prison for
two years.
   Bridget Hickey was next paraded.
   His Honor, the Recorder, lectured this black-eyed
little sinner severely, and adjudged her to the House
of Refuge <i>sine die</i>.
   William Thompson, a confirmed thief, convicted
of petty larceny, it being the second offence, was
next called up.
   His Honor adjudged this convict to dig stone of
Blackwell's Island for two years.
   William Clark convicted of obtaining money un-
der false pretences.
   This loafer of the genteel order, was a sort of in-
cipient financier, and raised an unauthorized loan on
the credit of one of his friends, for the small sum of
$10.
   The court adjudged him for this offence, to the
stone digging process for <u>ninety</u> days*.
   William J. Cummings for stealing a watch, was
sent to the penitentiary for four months.
   Hugh Burns indicted for robbing a foreign Jew <u title="pedlar OR peddler">ped-
dlar</u>, but convicted of only knocking out two of the
<u>Jews</u> teeth and otherwise maltreating him, was next
put to the bar.
   His Honor the Recorder, adjudged Burns to the
tombs for one week, and to pay a fine of $25, and
this his Honor called “making an example of Burns,
lest such cases should become somewhat too preva-
lent in this community!”
   George P. <u>Geizer</u>, for beating an officer of the Ma-
rine Court, was sent to the tombs for ten days.
   The sentence of the Court on Julia Tooker was
postponed until Tuesday next.
   John Williams and William <u>Stevenson</u>, not ap-
pearing to hear the sentence of the Court, their sure-
ties were estreated.
   John <u>Cronin</u>, a junk shop man, was called up on
two convictions of receiving stolen property of little
negro loafers.
   The Court lectured John considerably, and sent
him to the tombs for ten days for each offence, and
further to pay a fine of $25 for each offence, making
twenty days imprisonment and a fine of $50. John
grumbled much at this sentence, but could not get it
reduced.
<d>[Col.6]</d>
   <u>Christian Brennan</u> was put on his trial for a grand
larceny in stealing a trunk of wearing apparel and
watch, value $51, the property of Jonathan D. <u>How-
ell</u>, of No. 9 Mangin street. The case was clearly
made out, and the jury found him guilty without
leaving their seats.
   The Court immediately adjudged him to the State
Prison for three years.
   R<small>APE</small>.—James Reed a lubberly ill-looking boy, ap-
parently about <u>fourteen</u> years old, was put on his
trial charged with attempting to commit a rape on a
little girl, named <u>Mary Ann Millett</u>, who did not ap-
pear to be more than ten years of age.
   The details of this case were unfit for publication,
and the jury, after listening to the testimony adduced
pro and con, acquitted the boy, and the court ad-
journed to Monday, at 11 o'clock.
   * N<small>OTE</small>—Major Alexander G. Coxe, for obtaining
<s>s</s>egars to the value of $100 from a poor ignorant fo-
reigner, was merely adjudged to stay for thirty days
in the tombs, whilst Clark, for illegally borrowing
the sum of $10, was sent to <u title="herd">hurd</u> with the most aban-
doned characters and to dig stone for <u>ninety</u> days!
Now we should like to know on what principle of
criminal jurisprudence two such very different de-
grees of punishment should have been <u title="meted">meeted</u> out, to
a pair of such respectable professors of the art of vic-
timization. The ways of the wise, as <u title="Solomon">Soloman</u> ob-
served, are truly astounding to common folks.

			<b>City Intelligence.</b>
   E<small>DITOR IN</small> T<small>ROUBLE</small>.—Horace Greeley, the galva-
nized squash, has recently paid $80 to compromise a
suit brought against him by the U. S. District Attor-
ney, for penalties incurred for violations of the Post
Office laws and regulations. It is said that forty or
fifty other suits for similar violations have recently
been commenced. Nearly a bushel of New Worlds
have been detected in the same illicit correspond-
ence.

   <i>Jane Brush and her Cow—M. W. Dodd, Brick
Church Chapel</i>.—This is a translation from the
French, by the same fair hand whose fine version of
Dumas' Gaul and France, we noticed last week.
   It is a beautiful story, and none the less so, we dare
say, for the <i>dovetailing</i> of the translator's charming
imagination into the text—for, she tells us that she
has added to the original—though it is so ingenious-
ly done that it is quite impossible for us at least to
discover the “spots in the wainscot.” The little
volume furnishes one of the few instances in which a
work professing to be written for children, has been
successful. It is not written <i>down</i> to their feelings
and comprehension, but exactly upon a level with
them. Its language, and the incidents of the tale are
precisely what they should be, to made an impression
and do good. There is no baby talk about it, and
yet, every thing is so said as to adapt itself at once
to the capacity of the young mind at the earliest stage
of its understanding. No better child's book has
ever been written, and <i>we</i>, at any rate, have found it
very delightful reading <i>for children of some age</i>.

<b>A Curious Trial for Receiving Stolen Coffee.</b>
   The time of the five Judges, fat and lean, intelli-
gent and otherwise, was occupied yesterday, from
ten in the morning until almost ten at night, with
the trial of a very intelligent, good looking and appa-
rently respectable Scotchman, named James Ritchie.
   The charge against Ritchie was receiving 171
bags of coffee, each containing 120 pounds, worth
about $<u title="5,000 in Courier-1841-02-05">2,500</u>.
   After a great deal of the time of the court had
been wasted by several tedious talks between Wil-
liam M. Price and the court in relation to a woman,
and Charles O'Conner and the court in relation to
one of his clients, a great rascal, who ought to be in
the state prison; and after Judge Noah had adjust-
ed his wig several times, and put on his spectacles
and pulled them off half a dozen times, and read over
the morning papers, and scribbled the heads of an ar-
ticle for the “Star,” the District Attorney called out
   “Put James Ritchie to the bar.”
   Ritchie was then brought into court, remarkably
well but not showily dressed, and placed at the bar.
   A jury of a curious mixed medley collection of
characters was then sworn; and the District Attor-
ney rose and told them that the prisoner was indict-
ed for receiving several bags of stolen coffee, and
that he expected to be able to prove him guilty.
   Ritchie, it appears, was one of the three brothers,
James, Peter and Thomas. The prisoner, James,
could not procure bail, and had been in prison five
months. He was educated as a lawyer in London,
and when last in England was in the office of the
British Commercial Insurance Company, 35 Corn-
hill. He had also been a vestry clerk. He came to
this country several years ago, and had been a coffee
dealer. Thomas was a sailor, and had been mate of
a vessel.
   Mr. <u>William</u> Merle was the first witness called;
he was a Frenchman.
   He testified that he keeps several stores; kept Nos.
262 and 264 Front street; took possession of that
store on the first of August last. There were, then,
2000 bags of coffee on store; the bags were lettered
“A, B, C, D,” &c. The coffee was placed in the
second and third lofts. In September last, we found
out some bags had been stolen. We went on losing
coffee up till November; one day last November my
foreman showed me a lot of coffee shrewed about
under the hatch, and from there to the back door,
and we traced it through the yard up to the fence
that parts our store from Mr. Ritchie's, who lived at
260 Front street, and kept a junk store. We watch-
ed Ritchie's store, but saw no coffee go into it or
come out of it, except next day among the sweep-
ings of his store I saw some coffee, but I did not
handle any of it. We told the police and kept a
watch to catch the thief.
   <u>Morrell</u>—Did you see any one come that you
caught<u>.</u>
   Merle—They got wind I presume.
   <u>Morrell</u>—Never mind your presumption, sir.
   Merle—There were 171 bags stolen, averaging 120
lbs. each, and worth from 11 to 12 cents.
   Judge Noah, who was getting a little impatient
here pulled up his specs and pulled down his wig,
and cried out, “What kind of coffee was it that was
worth 12 cents a pound?”
   Merle—It was various kinds in the bags—all differ-
ent.
   <i>Cross-examined by <u>Morrell</u></i>—The coffee was there
when I took the store. It was counted, but I never
saw it counted. I don't positively know how much
coffee was in the store. John J. Hicks was the for-
mer lessee of the store.
   John J. Hicks was sworn—I don't know how much
coffee was in the store. Mr. Van Benschoten kept
the account. He handed it to me and I gave it to
Mr. Merle.
   Elias H. Van Benschoten sworn—I think there were
1827 bags of coffee in that store when Mr. Merle took
it. I handed the account to Mr. Hicks. I counted the
bags on the 1st of Aug. and a few days afterwards, and
<u>found found</u> the number right.
   Cross-examined—I didn't examine the bags parti-
cularly.
   George Griffin sworn—(This witness appeared to
be one of the better order of mechanics, pale from
sickness and confinement in prison for the last five
months, is a master cabinet maker from London; he
has been here 9 years.)
   Griffin—I was engaged in stealing this coffee.
   Judge Noah—How's that? Did you steal the cof-
fee? (Surprised.)
   Griffin—I'll tell you. The first I saw of any coffee
being stolen from Merle's store, was when I saw
George Rankin and Tom Ritchie.
   Judge Noah—(Laughing and looking with a know-
ing nod and a chuckle towards the Recorder.) Who's
that you say? Tom Ritchie?
   Griffin—Yes, Sir, Tom Ritchie. (Laughter.)
   Judge Noah—Did Tom Ritchie steal any coffee?
(Laughter.)
   Hays.—(angrily.) Silence in Court, gentlemen;
this is no laughing matter, if Tom Ritchie did steal
coffee.
   Recorder to Noah—Hays calls you to order bro-
ther Noah.
   Noah—Oh! I only laughed to think that there is
so little even in the name of citizen Ritchie. Go on.
   Griffin—Rankin and Tom Ritchie got a ladder,
went into Mr. Merle's loft, lower down four bags of
coffee, gave them to me, and I put them into James
Ritchie's junk store and Tom Ritchie.
   Noah—Stop—not so fast—I want to get all this
down about Tom Ritchie.
   Griffin—James Ritchie was not present.
   Noah—But Tom Ritchie was. (Laughter.)
   Griffin—Yes. The next time George and I went
and got six bags of coffee; and Tom remained be-
low and took them.
   Noah—Tom Ritchie was on the ground that time.
   Griffin—Yes. And so we went on several times till
we got a matter of 90 bags in all at different times. We
could easily put it from over the fence through a win-
dow into the junk shop. The coffee was left there
till <u title="James">Jame</u> Ritchie came there the next morning to see
it. Then it was put into carts and carted away for
sale. James Ritchie paid me $2 a bag, and gave Tom
$2 a bag, and George Rankin $3 a bag.
   Noah—Then Tom Ritchie did not have the largest
share of the plunder.
   Griffin—No.
   Noah—That's not characteristic of the name.
(Laughter.)
   Griffin—We stole altogether from 90 to 100 bags;
but then some more was stolen by Tom Ritchie be-
fore I began.
   Noah—Then Tom Ritchie stole some on his own
hook. (Laughter.)
   Griffin—I don't know what hook he stole it on—
he hooked it himself. (Laughter.) The stolen
coffee was sold to Mr. Gillies, in the 5th street, and to
Gilbert Colgate, or Colgate Gilbert, in Dutch street.
I sold it, and gave the money to James Ritchie. I
have seen James Ritchie up to Gillie's house.
   Cross-examined:—
   Q.—How long have you been a prisoner?
   A.—In the coffee business? (Roars of laughter,
in which Noah joined till his wig shook again.)
   Q.—No, sir, a prisoner.
   A.—Five months.
   Q.—Was you ever arrested for any robbery there?
   A.—I think not, there.
   Q.—Was you ever concerned in any other robbery
elsewhere?
   A.—Well, I believe I was in another store near
there.
   Recorder—Witness, you need not answer such
questions unless you like.
   Witness (with great humility)—Thank you sir<u>?</u>
(Laughter.)
   Cross-examination continued—I occupied the 2d
story, over James Ritchie's store; I fitted up count-
ers and things there, as may be; there was a shed
under the window of my floor, which ran up to
Merle's premises; Mr. James Ritchie has dried cof-
fee on that shed. Before he had that junk shop the
coffee was his business. I made up my mind to
testify against Mr. Ritchie two days after I was ar-
rested. I since justified in the half of $300 bail. I
don't know how much I'm worth now. I've been
plundered by one and another since I've been in pri-
son for the last five months. I'd be worth $150 next
week if Mr. Ritchie paid me that $80 he owes me,
which he's tried to rob me of since I have been in
prison, and he ought to be ashamed of it. I lent him
$40 and $25, all in cash, at two times. I got noth-
ing to show for it. I owe him nothing.
   Direct resumed—I'm a cabinet maker; I've known
Ritchie for ten years; I saw coffee in his store, and
knew it was stolen before I engaged in the busi-
ness.
   Noah—What business?
   Witness—The coffee line. [roars of laughter]
James Ritchie took me to a cellar to deposit much
of the coffee; it was two doors from Charlton street,
on the right hand side; a man name Carter lived up
stairs—he was a Londoner; sometimes I carried it
up there in a horse and wagon—sometimes James—
and sometimes Tom.
   Noah—Then Tom Ritchie worked sometimes?
   Witness—Yes; it was the overplus that was stored
up there, because he was afraid to sell too much at
once.
   Mr. Gillies sworn—I lived at 28 Fifth street; I
keep a spice and coffee factory. I bought coffee from
James Ritchie two or three times during last sum-
mer; not over 1,500 to 2,000 weight of him; I bought
more of Tom Ritchie.
   Noah—Then Tom Ritchie sold some?
   Witness—Yes, sir. James never brought any, ex-
cept a sample, Tom brought it; I think in July; it was
in barrels; Tom sold it, as he said, for himself and
brother; I bought in all from both between 3,000 and
5,000 weight of coffee; it came twice in bags—five
bags at one time. James never told me where he
got it; I gave nine cents a pound for it; <i>I once bought
500 weight of damaged coffee</i>—it was burnt in a fire at
the public store opposite James Ritchie's; I roasted
that with other coffee.
   Cross-examined—I always gave a fair market
<d>[Col.5]</d>
price for it. There was no concealment about it.—
No marks upon the bags I once lent James Ritchie
to buy coffee with. I was once in his employ when
he was in the coffee business in Broadway. He has
always borne a good character for integrity. I took
the coffee I bought to be La Guayra and Rio mixed.
La Guayra coffee has small kernels.
   Here some coffee (No. 1) was shown to witness,
that was taken out of the cellar in <u title="Macdougal">Mac Dougal</u>
street.
   Witness—That don't look like the coffee.
   Some coffee (No. 2) from the bags, still left in
Merle's store, was here shown witness.
   Witness—That don't look like it.
   Shaler—What kind of a way is that to swear
away a man's liberty, by trying to identify kernels
of coffee. (Laughter.)
   Judge Noah—We found it difficult to identify the
pork the other day—(roars of laughter)—and the man
was discharged; coffee kernels are queer things to
recognise.
   Witness—Some of that last lot (No. 2) looks like
Maracaibo coffee.
   Noah—I should like to see those different kinds, so
as to be able to know them again.
   Recorder—You know the taste of a good cup of
coffee, brother Noah, when you drink it?
   Noah—Yes, and wine, too.
   Witness—I can't swear to the coffee, nor no one
hardly, all coffee looks so much alike; some Mara-
caibo resembles La Guayra some, and vice versa;
some La Guayra is like some Maracaibo.
   Noah—But damaged coffee don't look like good
coffee.
   Witness—Not exactly.
   Noah—And yet you coffee roasters mix them up
together. It's a great imposition upon the public.
   <i>One of the Judges</i>—That's worse than stealing
coffee.
   Whiting—You were a friend of Ritchie's?
   Answer—I used to take a ride out of town with
him sometimes.
   Whiting—On a Sunday?
   Answer—I don't go riding on a Sunday; I go to
church. (Laughter.)
   Whiting—A very good place.
   Cross-examination continued—James Ritchie ne-
ver said the coffee I bought belonged to him. The
coffee I bought of them was very dirty, so that I had
to sift it.
   Noah—And yet it was all worked up, and sold to
the public?
   Answer—Yes.
   Robert Ballyntine sworn—Married Carter's daugh-
ter; lived at 38 Macdougal street; saw James Ritchie
there to tea once; never saw any coffee in the cel-
lar; Ritchie had no control over the cellar, or any
part of the premises. Never saw Ritchie in the base-
ment; never saw him with any coffee any where.
Griffin and Tom Ritchie came there once.
   Noah—Did Tom Ritchie take tea there?
   Answer—Yes.
   Elizabeth Ballyntine, (a very pretty English girl)
sworn—Lived with my father 38 Macdougal street;
James Ritchie was there once to take tea; I never
saw any coffee there.
   Mr. Stokely sworn—I was told Griffin knew all
about this robbery, and I arrested him; he offered to
turn state's evidence and directed me to the <u title="cellar">celler</u> in
Macdougal street; I went there and found coffee
grains mixed up in the sand and about a peck that
had run into a hole in the ground; there were
also some pieces of bags, but no marks on them; that
coffee in the paper (No. 1) is part of what I found
there; it looked as if coffee had been mixed in that
cellar.
   Cross-examined—Who arrested Griffin?
   Answer—Cockefair.
   Question—I thought it was you?
   Answer—No, I didn't arrest Griffin.
   Question—How long after he was arrested before
he promised to turn state's evidence?
   Answer—A day and a half.
   Question—Had you a search warrant when you
went to Macdougal street?
   Answer—No.
   Noah [surprised]—No search warrant? That's not
according to law.
   [Here there was a terrible cry from a woman in the
prison yard of “Let me alone<u title="!”]">!]</u>
   Shaler—Didn't you speak to Griffin about peach-
ing?
   Answer—Believe I did.
   Question—<u>Dont</u> you know you did?
   Answer—Yes, I did.
   Question—Then why <u>dont</u> you say so? Do you
know Ritchie's wife?
   Noah—Who? Tom Ritchie's wife?
   Shaler—I mean Griffin's wife.
   Answer—Yes.
   Noah—Oh.
   Question—Have you been to see her since his
arrest?
   Answer—Once.
   Noah—With the wife?
   Answer—Yes.
   Noah—Oh.
   Shaler—Didn't you take tea with her?
   A.—No, I hadn't that honor.
   Q.—Was there not some difference between her
and Ritchie?
   A.—I believe there was.
   Q.—Didn't she say that Tom Ritchie tried to ravish
her?
   Noah—(astonished)—What! Where! Who did
Tom Ritchie try to ravish?
   Witness—No, sir, it was Peter Ritchie she said
tried to ravish her.
   Shaler—Another brother, your honor.
   Noah—Gentlemen, be careful, or you'll confuse us
with this good woman and the Ritchies. Tom
Ritchie has got enough to answer for without the
charge of ravishing Mrs. Griffin.
   Shaler—Didn't the Grand Jury discharged the bill?
   Witness—I believe they did.
   Q.—Well, now, sir, wasn't he discharged?
   A.—Yes.
   Q.—Well, how could he have been discharged
unless by the Grand Jury?
   A.—Well, that's one way of getting discharged.
   Shaler—Well, that's what lawyers call getting
discharged. What other way is there?
   A.—Why, another way is to get 'em habeas'd—
(at this hit at Shaler's <i>penchant</i> the room rang with
laughter, in which Noah joined, until his spectacles
fell off and his wig almost followed suit.)
   Witness—We <u>knows</u> when a <s>man</s> gets arrested,
but it's difficult to tell when he gets discharged.—
(Laughter.)
   Noah—That's a bad way.
   <u>Morrell</u>—That's not the only bad thing about our
police and criminal courts.
   Whiting—We'll get them all reformed in time.
   Mr. Merle was again called to stand to endea-
vor to identify the coffee; but the amount of his
statement on this point was, that as all coffee was
mostly mixed up in the dealers' hands, it was next
to an impossibility to identify it.
   Mr. Colgate Gilbert was examined.—I have a cof-
fee and spice warehouse in Dutch street. A man
last summer came to me and asked me to go to
James Ritchie's store to look at some coffee. I
went—it was damaged coffee, smoked, and was
black. I bought from three to five bags of him. It
was all open—spread on the floor. I can't remem-
ber what I gave for it.
   Coffee shown to witness.
   Witness—Well, it might look something like that
coffee; but it's difficult to say about coffee, it's so
much mixed up.
   Noah—Ay, that's the tricks of the dealers and
roasters. (Laughter.)
   Morrill—I think they ought to be roasted for it.—
(Laughter.)
   Noah—You bought that damaged coffee—several
bags?
   A.—Yes.
   Q.—And mixed it up, roasted and sold it?
   A.—Yes, it was roasted and sold.
   Lynch—And so the community get shaved by bad
coffee.
   Whiting—We're not on trial for selling bad coffee.
We rest, sir.
			F<small>OR THE</small> D<small>EFENCE</small>.
   Geo. Rankin was brought out of prison and sworn.
(He is a tall six-foot Irish boy.) I never went with
Griffin to steal coffee. I never stole a grain of coffee
from any one. I never knew of any being stolen.
   Noah—How old are you?
   Ans.—I am 18 and 6 months, and a little better.
   Noah—You want to be more than a little better.
But only 18 and such a strapping fellow?
   Shaler—He's one of our genuine “dimmikrats”,
and they grow fast.
   Noah—Yes, ill weeds always grow space; and
that's the case with the locofocos. (Laughter.)
   Whiting—Not always, your Honor.
   Examination continued—I never was at Merle's
store in the night. Never put any coffee over the
fence.
   Whiting—But you're indicted for it, <u>aint</u> you.
   A.—I don't know what an indictment means.—
(Laughter.)—James Ritchie never told me to steal—
never threatened to shoot me if I didn't. Never paid
me to steal it, and I never did steal any. I always
had money of my own; and I brought money to this
country, bad luck to it. I made a statement in the
polices because Mr. Hicks told me to charge it all on
the Ritchies that they stole the coffee and I was so
<i>bewildered</i> with being in jail for first time I was born—
so I didn't know what I <u>wur</u> doing. (Laughter.)
   Noah, (aside)—That's too often the case with the
locofocos.
   Morrill—Yes, and the Conservatives, too.
   James Beach sworn—Was a porter in Ritchie's
store. Never saw any but damaged coffee there.
No coffee was ever concealed. I was there every
morning when the store was opened. Sometimes
James Ritchie sent the key down by Tom or Peter.
James bought eight or ten bags of damaged coffee
after the fire. I saw no coffee sent away in bags.
He didn't keep a horse and wagon. There was an
entrance to Griffin's loft, outside the house, by some
stairs. James Ritchie talked of turning Griffin out
of there.
   Capt. Smith <u>swore</u>—Known James Ritchie a year.
Always considered him an honest man. He pur-
chased a large quantity of coffee after the fire; it
was at the corner of South and Dover streets.
<d>[Col.6]</d>
   John <u>Gilmartine</u> sworn—Let the store to Tom and
James Ritchie. Tom made the agreement. I let a
loft to James to dry some damaged coffee in; the
loft was fifteen feet long; coffee was spread all over
it, and was eight inches deep. There must have
been from 3000 to 5000 weight there.
   Mr. Hicks was recalled, and denied telling Ran-
kin to charge the robbery on the Ritchies.
   He was asked to identify the coffee here pro-
duced, but said there were so many varieties, and so
much of mixing, that it was impossible to tell. The
coffee here produced, looked, he thought, like Java
coffee.
   Here, it will be remembered, that the various
witnesses had designated the sample before the
court successively as Java Coffee, <u title="La Guayra (above)">Laguayra</u> coffee,
Rio coffee and Maracaibo coffee.
   Tom Ritchie was sworn—He was a handsome,
honest looking sailor.
   Shaler—What's your name?
   Answer—Thomas Ritchie, some call me. Tom
Ritchie, I call myself.
   Noah—Oh, that's Tom Ritchie at last. He's a
much better looking man than citizen Ritchie.
   Witness—I hired that store of Mr. <u>Gilmartin</u>.
James advanced the money out of what my uncle in
Scotland left us all—my share was $780. I've been
in this country from a boy. I've been a sailor pretty
much all my life. I've been a mate of a vessel. My
brother never employed Griffin or Rankin to steal
coffee; he bought a large lot of coffee from Justice
Hopson after the fire. I spread the coffee out on the
shed myself to dry. We were often spilling coffee
about round the premises. I used to buy the coffee
sweepings from the mates of vessels, and sell it to the
coffee roasters.
   Noah—And they sell it for the best, I suppose?
   Tom (laughing).— I s'pose so, your honor; they
do a good many worse tricks than that on shore.
   Shaler—Particularly the clothes men along Water
and Chatham streets.
   Tom—I've bought bags of coffee myself—some
from the brig Grecian. I swapped a boat away for
a lot of coffee once. My brother has bought coffee
several times. I had the control of that store. He
just see to how the money was laid out, and what
profits there was on to it, and give 'em to me. But
I was going to leeward fast; we lost $560 in a few
months, and he's got my note for the half, $280. My
brother was in the British Commercial office, 35
Cornhill.
   Whiting—Now, Tom, can't you tell us how that
coffee was got out of that loft?
   Tom—(Bluntly but pleasantly.) No.
   Whiting—Didn't you have a hand in it?
   Tom—Why, Mr. Whiting, you know you tried me
for stealing it, and tried hard to convict me, but you
didn't do it; and so if I had I think you'd a done it;
and as you didn't, I <u>dont</u> think you've any right to
ask me, and I don't think I've any right to answer
you. (Roars of laughter followed this frank effu-
sion from Tom.)
   Whiting—Very well, then Tom, you think so?
   Tom—Yes, Mr. Whiting, I know so. [laughter]
   Whiting—Did you take any coffee up to that cel-
lar in Macdougal street?
   Tom—Yes, Mr. Whiting, I did; and I bought it
honestly. I took it there to mix the good and bad
all up together; because the first lot we sold Mr.
Gillies he complained that it was bad and damaged;
and so after it was mixed he couldn't tell the differ-
ence. [laughter]
   Noah—Oh, that's the way they cheat the public
in coffee, Tom, is it?
   Tom—Yes, your honor, that's the way they fix off
the coffee; and if nobody never cheated the public
no worse nor that, they'd be a darned right better off
than they are now. [roars of laughter]
   Whiting—<u>Havn't</u> you said you had that coffee?
   Tom—Yes; I said so, because nobody had a right
to ask me.
   Whiting—<u>Havn't</u> you told Mr. Merle that you
stole it?
   Tom—Let Mr. Merle tell what I told him; and if
he tells the truth I'll own to it.
   Whiting—That's all.
   The testimony here closed. The case was ably
summed up, particularly by John A. Morrill. The
Recorder's charge was short, impartial, and the case
went to the jury about 7 o'clock. The Jury, after be-
ing absent but a very short time, returned a verdict
of G<small>UILTY</small>.

   We had a man convicted here, last week, of rape,
committed under the most revolting circumstances.
The victim was the wife of a very respectable me-
chanic in Moyamensing. The perpetrator, who is
a most hard-featured villain, will probably be allowed
several years in the Penitentiary, to cool his pas-
sions. Talking of women, there has been a good
deal of excitement in certain quarters lately, in re-
ference to an attempt made by one of our notorious
young bucks, on a young lady connected with a
well known millinery establishment, in Chesnut
street. I have not been able to obtain the particu-
lars, as the friends of the creature in pantaloons are
attempting to smother the matter.
   We have a large number of navy officers here,
who having nothing else to do, are much given to
this sort of business. One of them actually grasped
the arm of a most beautiful girl, at her own door,
some time ago; whereupon her brother making his
appearance, gave his cowardly hide a dusting, which
he will remember for many a long day. We have
now established here a paper called the Censor,
which gives information long needed to strangers,
as to the most desirable lodging places for the weary
traveller. It answers the same purpose here that the
Advocate of Moral Reform does in New York.

	COURT OF SESSIONS—Y<small>ESTERDAY</small>.
			<m9>[Reported for the Sun.]</m9>
   Before the Recorder, Judges Lynch <u title="and">an</u> Noah,
and Aldermen Pollock and Lee.
   Much of the time of the Court yesterday was
occupied in hearing motions for the postponement
of trials, amongst which was one made by Mr.
Price, in the case of Ann Foster, a well dressed
elderly lady, who was put to the bar charged with
passing a number of counterfeit bills. The trial
was set down for this day.
   The grand jury come into court and presented
a number of bills.
   R<small>ECEIVING</small> S<small>TOLEN</small> G<small>OODS</small>.—James Ritchie
was then put to the bar, charged with receiving
171 bags of coffee, value upwards of $2000, know-
ing the same to be stolen.
   The particulars of this case have been fre-
quently before the public. The coffee was stolen
from the store of Mr. Merle in Front street, and
a brother of this prisoner was some time ago tried
on an indictment charging him with participation
in the robbery, and acquitted.
   The principal witness against the prisoner was
George Griffin (state's evidence) who swore that
he, George Rankin and Thomas Ritchie the broth-
er of the prisoner, went repeatedly to the store of
Mr. Merle, which they entered at night through
one of the windows, by means of a ladder—that
several bags of coffee were stolen and removed to
the house of the prisoner, who kept a junk store
next to Mr. Merle's store.
   Rankin was brought out of the Tombs, and
placed on the stand; he, however, denied knowing
anything at all about the transaction, although on
his examination when committed he had made
statements corroborative of the testimony of
Griffin.
   Evidence was adduced to prove that the prison-
er sold large quantities of coffee to venders in Fifth
street, and Dutch street.
   Officer Stokely was produced to show that
quantities of coffee were found strewed about the
rear of the premises of Mr. Merle.
   Mr. Merle could not identify any of the coffee
which was traced to the possession of the prisoner,
as that which had been stolen from his store.
   For the defence a Captain Smith was called,
who deposed that the prisoner was in the habit of
purchasing quantities of damaged coffee.
   Several other witnesses of respectability were
called and testified to the good character and ho-
nesty of the prisoner.
   Mr. Shaler addressed the Jury very ably and
eloquently for the prisoner's defence.
   Mr. Whiting replied and summed up for the pro-
secution.
   The Recorder briefly charged the Jury, who re-
tired for deliberation.
   After an absence of two hours the Jury return-
ed with a verdict finding the prisoner guilty.

   The queen of dance, Fanny Elssler, has returned

She received $1000 a night in Havana, and receives

			<b>General Sessions.</b>
Present, the Recorder, Judges Noah, Lynch, and two
			Aldermen.
   <i>Second Trial of Ritchie</i>.—James Ritchie, convicted on
Monday of receiving stolen coffee, was put to the bar on
an indictment of grand larceny, in stealing 30 morocco
skins, the property of Jacob Riberdale, No. 9, Jacob
street.
   The prosecution deposed, that in the early part of No-
vember last he lost about thirty skins, French dressed.
	...
   The Jury returned under the charge of the Court and
convicted Ritchie of the charge as laid in the indictment.
   <i>Riot</i>.—Henry Strickland, Charles Brown, William La-
tham, Stebbins Andrews, Nathaniel Reeder, Wm. El-
more, Mike Kelly, and Edward Wall, were all put on
trial, charged with perpetrating a political riot in the 7th
ward, at the late election.
   This case was heard by the late Recorder in the early
part of the year, and the jury did not agree. The same
testimony was read to the jury, and they convicted all
except Edward Wall.
   The Court then adjourned.

<b>Another Curious Scene in the Court of Ses-
   sions, in which Noah, the New Judge in
   Israel, figures largely.</b>
   No stranger should leave this city without pay-
ing a visit to that strange assemblage of stupidity,
good sense, cupidity, wit, folly, dirt, rascality, ob-
stinacy, and bad smells, called the Court of Sessions.
Of which of these Noah is the presiding deity, we
shall not at present undertake to say.
   The Court, as at present constituted, by Heaven
knows whom, is the most singular and unique one
ever seen beneath the sun. There is on the bench a
Protestant, an Israelite, a Catholic, a Nothingarian,
and, we believe, a Presbyterian, or an Anything-
arian. There is one sensible man, and sound law-
yer, one ridiculous old fool, one thick-headed
fellow, with a great deal of pretension to legal
knowledge, but with a less amount of whole-
some brains than a terrapin; one good jolly look-
ing fellow, apparently born abroad, and with a
countenance that might induce any malicious rascal
to accuse him of having a bad temper; and one lit-
tle lean, hungry-looking, lizard-like, kind of well
disposed little man, that might be taken for a repre-
sentative of those lean kine described by Pharaoh,
which swallowed up several other kine; not swine,
or Noah certainly would not sit next to him.
   The Court (as understood by a large majority of
the honest men in this city) is legally composed of
the Recorder, F. A. Tallmadge, Esq., a very able and
sound lawyer, and two Aldermen elected by the
people. There are also two excrescences forced upon
the Court by a few fools at Albany against the will
of the people, (but who will be removed the instant
the next legislature meets,) in the persons of Mr.
Lynch, an indifferent lawyer, and the notorious M.
M. Noah, a broken down politician—neither of
whom are recognised by the corporation.
   The Sessions room is dirty, uncomfortable, and
miserably constructed. The Recorder and the four
so-called Judges, are all stuck up on a row like so
many hens on a hen-roost, so that this Court has not
been inappropriately called the “HENROOST
COURT.” A dirty semi-circular table is placed in
front of the Henroost bench, which is covered with
old hats and sleeves of old coats, with arms in them,
and generally surrounded by loafers, and a few law-
yers. Between this half moon table and the hen-
roost bench is placed a miserably old dirty, filthy,
round table, 2½ feet in diameter, and at which only
three persons can sit without inconvenience, which
no one would sit at with a decent coat on, and which
is too low in the legs for any but a boy to sit at in
any way, and this is dignified with the name of the
“R<small>EPORTER'S</small> T<small>ABLE</small>.”
   Of all this the greatest joke is, the new Judge in
Israel—or Israelitish Judge in Christendom, M. M.
Noah. Since he has been appointed to the office of
Judge, he has lost his melancholy agitated cast of
countenance, become more slippery and cunning
and conceited than ever, reads the newspapers on
the bench, and talks, and laughs, and retails old
jokes—not old clothes—and manages the affairs of
the nation and petty larceny rascals through the
columns of the “Evening Star.”
   Yesterday presented an excruciatingly amusing
scene of excitement in the Court of Sessions. Judge
Noah was in a state of hysterics—his very wig mov-
ing alive with indignation.
   When the Judge was appointed to the Christian
bench, we said his appointment would be worth a
thousand a year. So it is rapidly becoming. Here
is the first order of the afflicted:—
<m9>	J<small>UDGE</small> N<small>OAH'S</small> O<small>RDER IN</small> C<small>OURT</small>.
   At the opening of the Court of General Sessions,
yesterday morning, Judge Noah said he had been
shown a report in the Morning Herald, purporting
to be the proceedings in this Court, which was a tis-
sue of misrepresentations from beginning to end. It
was due to myself to say, that not a single remark
which had fallen from myself was correctly re-
ported. Owing to a similarity of name between the
person on trial, and Mr. Ritchie, of the Richmond
Enquirer, the reporter, William H. Attree, had so
framed certain questions, and put the answers there-
to in the mouth of one of the Judges, (myself,) as to
make it appear that I had intentionally insulted that
gentleman; now I take this opportunity of stating
that I have the greatest respect for <i>that</i> Mr. Ritchie;
and that, while uniting with this Court in permitting
the utmost freedom to the press, yet we cannot tole-
rate this species of misrepresentations. The Court
has, therefore, made the following order, (Recorder
Tallmadge excepting):—
   “The report in this morning's Herald, purporting
to be an account of the proceedings of the Court in
the trial of James Ritchie, being a tissue of misre-
presentations calculated to reflect on the character of
the Court, and bring the cause of justice and deco-
rum into disrepute, it is hereby ordered that the re-
porter, <i>William H. Attree</i>, be hereafter excluded
from having a seat, <small>AS SUCH</small>, <i>at the reporters' table of
this Court</i>.”</m9>
   As this is the first time we have come in contact with
the Judge since he left off dealing in old clo' and old
sayings, we're not much afraid of him, or his order,
or all his law learning. We shall issue, therefore, a
counter order, to the following effect:—
<m9>		O<small>RDER OF</small> E<small>DITOR</small> B<small>ENNETT</small>.
   Judge N<small>OAH</small> having, without regard to the Con-
stitution or the laws of Moses, without even a trial
according to the Anglo Saxon laws, excluded Wm.
H. Attree from the reporter's seats of the Court of Ses-
sions, we, the editor of the New York Herald, hereby
order the useful sprite Ariel from paradise, to attend
daily the Sessions, and to take his seat daily on the
tip of Judge Noah's wig, and to report faithfully the
“saying and doings” of the Judge, be they silly or
otherwise, down to the very movements of each
particular hair of the selfsame wig. We know very
well the difficulty of reporting Judge Noah with per-
fect accuracy, because, being a descendant of the
stock of Judas Iscariot, he is as slippery as an eel,
and as witty as an owl, but we have no doubt
enough of him will be caught to show forth his pe-
culiar attainments, so that the world may be en-
lightened by his vast surplus stock of wisdom and
black letter law learning.
   And furthermore, it is our firm belief that if the
administration of justice is to be brought into fur-
ther disrepute (a very doubtful thing) it will arise
from the folly of Governor Seward in placing on a
Christian bench, one of the race of Barabbas, who
knows as little of any Christian legal code, as he does
of the Gospel itself. And again it is very amusing
certainly to see this Judge talk of the respect he en-
tertains for “Citizen Ritchie”—a man whom he has
been assailing in his “Evening Star,” ever since his
own opinion on the U. S. Bank was very conveni-
ently changed at the time he received a slice of the
$52,000 in 1830.
   We therefore direct our reporter, the aforesaid
elegant Ariel of heavenly memory, to report Noah
each day, to report him from the tip of his wig to the
toe of his boots. The community want something
to amuse them in this warm weather. We know
the difficulty of reporting correctly such a slippery old
chap—but the best that can be done shall be done.
Noah will give more public entertainment in our re-
ports, than he ever did as editor—as orator on Grand
Island—or as politician and office beggar. So look
out for fun, absurdity and law mixed up together.
   And furthermore and finally, I hereby order, that
Judge Noah—the same Judge who issued the pro-
clamation for assembling the Jews at Grand Island
—the same Noah who attempted to make pure
wine for the Christian communion table, out of old
and musty raisins—that he is hereby prohibited each
and every morning, from reading the classic columns
of the Herald, and that every carrier and newsboy
is instructed not to sell Noah any Herald, for love,
money, or old clo'—and that the newsboys, if Noah
should beg to buy a paper, are hereby instructed to put
their right thumb on the nose, extend the four fingers
toward the east, making a gyration in the air, and
uttering, at the same time, these solemn words, “ba—
ba—ba—ba.”</m9>
   Again—A few days ago a highly respectable loafer
with a long beard, and abundance of old clothes on his
back, (though not a descendant from Judas Iscariot,
or the tribe of Barabbas,) but having a very respecta-
ble hole in his breeches, was brought up before this
dirty, bad smelling Court—we mean Court room—
and arraigned on a charge of stealing three pounds
of pork, price three shillings.
   As soon as the Recorder heard the charge, which
Noah, who was busy with the newspapers, did not
hear, he said, “Mr. District Attorney, this seems
to be a very small affair; why don't you send this
man to the Special Sessions? It's only three shil-
lings.”
   The District Attorney, also a remarkably sensible,
shrewd, and honest man, but who loves dearly to
crack a joke at the expense of Mr. Noah and Mr.
Lynch, replied, “The man wants to be tried by this
Court, for stealing his pork!” laying particular em-
phasis on the word “pork,” with a sly wink at Noah.
   On this, Judge Noah, who is so fat, and sleek, and
slippery, that he frequently almost tumbles asleep on
the bench, or looks like it, which is much the same,
<d>[Col.3]</d>
roused himself up, and cried out, “pork! pork!
what's that about pork?”
   The Recorder, who also loves a joke as dearly as
any man living, and who frequently laughs in his
sleeve at the ignorance of law displayed by his asso-
ciates, turned round to Noah, and observed, “Bro-
ther Noah, as this case of stealing pork seems to lay
legitimately on your side of the bench, suppose you
try it.”
   “Pork! pork!” said Noah, “who'd ever think of
stealing pork?”
   “This man is charged with stealing pork, may it
please your honor,” said the District Attorney, <u title="laying">lay-</u>
particular stress upon the word “honor.”
   Noah, to the trembling loafer in the old clothes,
with the hole in his breeches, “How came you to
steal pork?”
   Loafer.—I don't know that I did.
   Mr. Noah.—But you're indicted for it.
   Loafer.—(Leisurely.)—Why I went into the store
to buy some butter and potatoes, and I paid for 'em,
and somehow or other I thought I paid for that pork.
(Roars of laughter.)—Noah frowned.
   Noah.—Paid for pork—paid for pork. (Laughter.)
Why, who ever heard of paying for pork? I never
paid for any pork in my life. Nobody ought to buy
pork. Nobody ought to touch pork.
   Loafer.—Well, I'm very fond of pork. (Laughter
among the loafers.)
   Noah.—Pshaw! You ought to suffer some for your
folly and bad taste. Found of pork? Faugh! (Laugh-
ter.)
   Loafer.—Well, that's all a matter of taste. (Laugh-
ter.)
   The evidence was then heard, and it being but
very slight, and the Judge in Israel, not liking, as
we presume, to recognize the stealing of pork as a
punishable offence, he at last dismissed the loafer,
with a solemn request never to touch pork again, and
amid roars of laughter from the bystanders.

	GENERAL SESSIONS.
   Upon the opening of the Court the following order
was unanimously adopted, and directed to be placed
upon the minutes:
   The report in this morning's Herald, purporting
to be an account of the proceedings of this Court, in
the trial of James Ritchie being a tissue of misre-
presentations, calculated to reflect on the character
of the Court, and bring the cause of justice and deco-
rum into disrepute, it is hereby
   Ordered that the reporter <i>William H. Attree</i>, be
hereafter excluded from having a seat, as such, at the
reporter's table of this Court.
   James Ritchie was for the second time put to the
bar for trial, on charge of grand larceny, in stealing
a quantity of morocco skins, value $61. Ample proof
of his guilt was produced by the prosecution, and the
jury found him guilty.
   In the case of Robert Bolton, indicted for grand
larceny, a number of affidavits were produced, tend-
ing to show that the accused was subject to fits of
<u title="aberration">abberation</u> of mind, and which was probably the
case at the time the alluded offence was committed.
By consent of the District Attorney, the Court di-
rected a <i>nol. pros.</i> to be entered and Bolton was dis-
charged.
	...
   <i>Inquest</i>.—The Coroner yesterday held an Inquest
on the body of an unknown man, found floating in
the dock foot of Canal street, North River—Verdict,
found drowned.
			—————
   <i>Park Theatre</i>—Mademoiselle Elssler appears again
this evening in the same dance, and same character,
“Nathalie,” in which she performed on Monday
evening. From the appearance of the Box sheet
there is every prospect of another crowded audience,
comprising the beauty and fashion of our city.
   <i>Bowery Theatre</i>.—The “Mother Goose” panto-
mime “takes” so well at the Bowery, that every
seat in the dress circle has been taken for this and
to-morrow evening. The Swiss Brothers and Miss
Lee are now the <i>legitimate pantomimists</i>. The trage-
dy of Hamlet opens the performances at the Bowery
this evening. Hamlet by Mr. Hamblin.

tyro in the healing art, the proprietor of 12 Peck slip begs
leave to direct the attention of a discerning public to the
inference of the comparison. Be particular in the number
12, on red signs—there is no Dr. Evans at No. 9, or in the

F<small>OREMOST AT THE</small> S<small>YNAGOGUE</small>.—An election took
place for trustees at the Synagogue in Crosby street
on Tuesday. Noah was a candidate for one of the
Board. One of his antagonists was Mr. Lazarus, a
highly respectable Hebrew. Noah fixed on his wig
and old breeches and tried to run into the office, but
Mr. Lazarus left the Judge far behind, the latter hav-
ing lost his wig and specs in the race.
   We congratulate the Crosby street people that
they have not permitted an old political loafer to su-
perintend the affairs of that holy place. Noah's
piety lays in his breeches' pocket.
			—————
   R<small>ETURN OF</small> C<small>OL</small>. S<small>TONE</small>.—Col. Stone returned yes-
terday from Washington, where he has been for a
week, boring for a diplomatic place for himself, and
the post office here, for a politician called Havens.
He was equally successful in both. We advise
Stone to quit office begging, animal magnetism,
huge eating, and all such vanities. Go to work—
and attend to your newspaper.
			—————
   F<small>URTHER</small> P<small>ROGRESS OF THE</small> E<small>LSSLER</small> M<small>ANIA</small>.—
Last evening was rather cool and pleasant in the
Park—but in the Park theatre the thermometer stood
at 110 at least.
   Fanny Elssler appeared again last night at this
theatre, and, as usual, it was crammed from pit to
<u>Shakspeare</u>, besides running over at the doors.
There is no diminution of the <i>mania</i>. The whole
theatrical floating interests of the legitimate drama
—with the exception of Thorne of the Chatham,
which has also its own mania—are devising ways
and means among the small critics to get up a “mo-
ral war” against Fanny, but it seems to be no go. She
carries everything before her, and the “squashes”
too.
			—————
   C<small>OURT OF</small> S<small>ESSIONS</small>.—The proceedings in this mis-
erable hole yesterday, which is called by some the
“Henroost Court,” were of little interest. George
Rankin, the witness introduced in Noah's celebrated
trial, was tried and convicted of burglary, in break-
ing into and stealing coffee from Mr. Merle's store.
And the notorious old stool-pigeon, Butcher Joe, the
last of the race, was convicted of robbing Mr. Sea-
grave of Providence, R. I. of $710, in March last, in
Broadway.
   A motion was made and argued at some length by
W. H. Attree, that the Court do rescind the order
made in relation to him the day before, because it
was, as the Recorder said, informal, i. e. illegal—
done without evidence or notice to show cause;
<i>was written by Noah, and sanctioned by him and Lynch
alone</i>, the Recorder considering it informal, and the
two Aldermen dissenting from it. The Court will
doubtless take time to consider of it, before they ex-
punge their illegal and ridiculous act. We shall
give full particulars hereafter.
   Mr. M. M. Noah, the so-called Judge (for a very
short period,) shook like an <u title="aspen">aspin</u> leaf and was as
red as an old turkey hen the whole day on account
of what appeared in the “Herald.” He denied, like
a false old fool as he is, that he had any thing to do
with the “Star,” and said nothing till towards night,
when he fell asleep. Mr. Lynch looked ridiculous
the whole day, and was laughed at by Tallmadge,
Whiting, the Aldermen, and all the lawyers for his
folly.
			—————
   F<small>URNITURE FOR THE</small> R<small>USSIAN</small> S<small>TEAMER</small>.—There are
now to be seen at Charles A. Baudouine's, No 332
Broadway, several articles of furniture—the richest
and the most sumptuous we ever saw. They were
manufactured by Mr. Baudouine for his Imperial Ma-
jesty of Russia, and will decorate the two drawing
rooms of the steam frigate “<u title="Kamchatka">Kamschatska</u>,” now
nearly ready for sea.
   The principal articles are two sofas, eight drawing
room chairs, four large arm chairs, four <u title="tabourets">tabourettes</u>,
and two large circular tables. These are all in the
antique style, and made of the costliest rose wood,
highly polished. The chairs and sofas are covered
with light blue satin damask, delicately figured.
They are stuffed with eider down, and have spring
bottoms. The tops of the tables, which are very
large and massive, are each of one slab of marble of
Parian whiteness. Each article has a superb cover-
ing of cloth, which looks more like leopard skin than
anything else. Nothing of the kind so splendid was
ever made before. All go on board in a day or two.
M. de Bodisco, the Russian Minister, is highly pleased
with their beauty and finish.
   The drawing rooms of the steam frigate into which
these go, are to be fitted up in a beautiful and unique
style, to correspond with the furniture. It is said
they will be used by the Imperial family only.
   We understand that the “<u>Kamschatska</u>” will be
finished next month, and take an experimental trip
to the south. She will then return, take in coal, and
start for St. Petersburg. As a steam vessel, she will
be the most complete of any on the water, and we
have it as the opinion of scientific and experienced
naval men, that no other vessel will equal her in
speed. Her decorations will be superb, and her ar-
mament powerful. In a work, she is a nonesuch,
and we have every reason to feel proud of her as a
production of this Republic.

<l9>   T<small>HE</small> N<small>EW</small> Y<small>ORK</small> S<small>UN</small>.—How can any Christian
patronize this vile print? Look at its constant ad-
vertisements of Madame Restell, and others of a
similar character, which render it unfit to be re-
ceived into any decent family. Look at its base
attack recently upon Methodist Class Meetings.
And last Saturday it came out in a scurrilous at-
tack upon the friends of freedom, denouncing
them as a set of “addle-pated fanatics.” We call
on all friends of virtue to set their faces against
that print, as utterly unworthy of their support.
					[Zion's Watchman.</l9>
   We copy the above, not because we deem it of
the least importance to expose or refute the base
falsehoods which it utters or insinuates against us;
these, with a thousand others like them, conceived
in the same spirit, “pass by us like the idle wind.”
Indeed it gives us pleasure, as far as we are indi-
vidually concerned, to meet these spiteful attacks
from fanatics, hypocrites, and corrupt partizans,
who allow themselves to be “the tools with which
knaves do worth withal.” When we are attacked
from such quarters, it gives us strong assurance
tha we are doing our duty to the public, that truth
is making its way in triumph, while error is writh-
ing beneath the blows that are inflicted upon it.—
But we copy the above paragraph for the purpose
of showing the public, and especially the Chris-
tian public, the character of a paper that pretends
to minister to them in holy things. This quintes-
sence of “envy, hatred, malice, and all uncharita-
bleness,” comes from a journal which professes to
teach the religion of the “meek and lowly Jesus”
—a paper which claims to be a watchman on the
towers of Zion. Will not the Prince of Darkness
laugh to find the gates in the keeping of <i>such</i>
Watchmen?
   In the same paper we find the benevolent and
humane efforts of the Colonization Society de-
nounced with more bitterness than the Sun. It
says, “the infinite God looks with utter abhor-
rence upon this scheme.” But worse than this,
the same paper contains an article calling upon all
the churches to drive away from the holy sacra-
ment of the Lord's supper all professing chris-
tians who are slaveholders! And it is recommen-
ded to commence this impious work immediately,
“this summer—this week if you can,”—while the
Southern slaveholders are travelling at the North!
Finally it contains the abolition nomination of
James G. <u title="Birney (in Wikipedia)">Birnie</u> for President of these United
States in 1844.
	...
If hypocrites who claim to be Zion's watchmen
continue to impose upon the Christian public, it
shall not be because we neglect to expose their
falsehoods. If political demagogues, who support
the little interests of faction rather than the great
interests of the country, are countenanced by a
cajoled and cheated people, it will not be because
we shall cease to proclaim the truth, fearless and
free. So we give a fair warning to all these mad-
caps of what we intend to do; and if they intend to
put us down they had better be stirring them-
selves, for our subscription list is increasing ra-
pidly every day.

<d>[Col.2]</d>
<b>Judge Noah's Order in Court—The Argument
		in relation thereto.</b>
   As Judge Noah took particular pains to write him-
self the order in relation to one of the gentlemen in
the employ of the proprietor of this paper, and to see
it published, we think proper to publish the argu-
ment had in relation to the order in the Court of Ses-
sions the day after the order was promulgated.
   Almost immediately after the opening of the Court,
W. H. Attree (who had entered the Court room, and
taken his seat at the table appropriated for lawyers)
rose and said:—
   “May it please the Court; as I have been, by an
extra-judicial, and, as I consider it, an illegal action
of a part of this Court, (here Noah wriggled in his
seat,) brought as a suitor within the Court, I must
request permission to introduce a motion to rescind
the order made in relation to myself, and the further
permission to address the Court in relation thereto;
stating the reasons why I deem the said order illegal.
(Here Noah and Lynch colored up and seemed de-
termined to shirk the question if possible.)
   <i>Recorder</i>.—Certainly, Mr. Attree, you have a per-
fect right to address the Court in relation to the mat-
ter you speak of; and as it is a personal application I
see no objection to your doing so fully at once.
   (Here Noah and Lynch colored still deeper, looked
as savage as hungry bears, and both whispered the
Recorder together; and the noise and confusion in
the Court room became terrible.)
   <i>Attree</i>.—In all that I may say or have said, I dis-
tinctly disclaim any intention to treat this Court with
disrespect—the Court as I consider it, legally consti-
tuted under the City Charter; but my rights as a pri-
vate individual have been invaded by the Court; and
in my person, the rights of every individual connect-
ed with the press of this city have been invaded.—
For I believe that it will be admitted by the Court
without argument, (as it is notoriously known even
to every student at law,) that the grand fundamental
principle of the common law is that the rights of no
individual, however humble, can be touched by any
Court of Justice, unless that individual be present ei-
ther in person or by counsel to answer to the charges
preferred against him. (Murmurs of applause among
the lawyers, and remarks of “That's good law,” “He's
perfectly right.”) On this account, I insist that be-
fore this Court could issue such an illegal order as
they have done, they were by the common law and
in common justice bound to serve a notice on me to
appear and show cause why such an order should not
issue and be enforced against me. I therefore, re-
spectfully move the Court that the order made yes-
terday in relation to myself—which I find published
in the “Evening Star” (Noah colored) accompanied
with false editorial comments (Noah colored still
deeper) which I presume were written and furnished
to the “Evening Star” by one of the Judges of this
Court. (Noah became very red with rage.) I move,
I repeat, that this order be rescinded; upon the ground
that the Court had no legal evidence before them that
I wrote the report of which the Court complains; that
I was not present to answer when the order<u>;</u> was
made, and that therefore such order was informal—
that is, illegal—contrary to common sense, contrary
to sound justice and contrary to law.
   By this time Noah and Lynch had worked them-
selves into a towering passion; although from the
usual noise and confusion in Court, the shuffling of
feet, the walking to and fro, and the talking of the
lawyers, neither of them had heard above a quarter
of what the speaker had said. They both talked to
the Recorder at once, and both were evidently afraid
that the Recorder and the two Aldermen would
overrule them, and rescind the order. They there-
fore determined to shirk the question until the two
Aldermen had left the bench. For this reason Lynch
exclaimed “Mr. Attree this thing will give rise to a
good deal of discussion and it had better be postpon-
ed for the present.” They then again whispered the
Recorder, who said in a mild manner, “Mr. Attree
you have an undoubted right to be heard patiently by
the Court, and shall be heard; but as there are a
great many witnesses here who came from a dis-
tance, and one from Rhode Island, whose causes are
about to be called on, I think it will be better that
you postpone your motion until one or two of these
cases are disposed of.”
   <i>Attree</i>.—Certainly, with a great deal of pleasure;
under those circumstances I will postpone it for the
present.
   <i>Recorder</i>.—You shall have an opportunity of being
heard during the day if you wish it.
   Here the matter was suspended until the latter
part of the evening session; when, the two Alder-
men having left the bench, Mr. Attree requested the
Recorder to allow him to postpone his motion until
the morning, so that the Aldermen might be present.
Noah and Lynch seeing this, <u title="overruled">over-ruled</u> the Record-
er, and insisted that the motion should be brought on
then; it being nearly half past nine at night; and
Mr. Attree had been kept dancing attendance there
since half past 10 in the morning. This measure
was doubtless resorted to in consequence of the Al-
dermen stating to Mr. Attree during the day that
they had not been consulted in relation to the order,
and the Recorder also stating to Mr. A. that he con-
sidered the order an <i>informal</i> one; that it was writ-
ten by Noah, and only showed it to him, just as he
was about to take his seat on the bench; that he
disapproved of it; that he found himself <u title="overruled">over-ruled</u>
by Lynch and Noah; and that he then refused to
read the order form the bench because it was infor-
mal; and that he further said to Noah, “If you
choose to make a display of this kind you may be
your own orator, for I will not.” Under these cir-
cumstances it doubtless was that Noah and Lynch
insisted that Mr. Attree should bring his motion on
at that late hour of the evening.
   The Recorder then said,—“Mr. Attree, you were
about to address the Court in the morning in rela-
tion to a motion concerning yourself; the Court will
now hear any remarks you may have to make con-
nected with you motion.
   <i>Attree</i>—I would prefer waiting until the morning,
or until all the members of the Court are present.
   <i>Lynch</i>—There is a Constitutional Court present
now, sir.
   <i>Attree</i>—May it please the Court, I respectfully
state that I do not think so. And I believe a major-
ity of the people of this city are of the same opinion.
And I therefore respectfully request the Court to <u>al-
allow</u> me to postpone the motion till the morning.—
I regret to have troubled the Court, with any re-
quest, but if they would allow me delay—
   <i>Lynch</i> (rudely and abruptly)—There's no apology
necessary, sir; if you have nothing to say, there's
an end of it. (Noise in court.)
   <i>Attree</i>—No, may it please the Court, there's not
an end of it. I will proceed now, though conscious
that a majority of the Judges will decide against me.
But I care not about this matter, as it immediately
concerns myself. The late order of the Court, is a
matter of very little moment to me as an individual.
But, the order of the Court touched upon broad and
delicate grounds; it was an infringement of the sa-
cred liberties possessed by the press. And wherever
my lot may be cast in this life, and under whatever
clime I may be destined by a Superior Power to so-
journ for the remainder of my existence, it shall ne-
ver be said that the liberty of the press was first in-
vaded by any Court, or any power, in my person,
without a struggle on my part to strangle the act of
tyranny. (Great noise in Court.) I desire to treat
the Court with all due respect in what I say; but I
insist that the order of the Court made in relation to
myself, was illegal; it was issued without any legal
evidence being taken by the Court that I wrote the
report; this ought to have been done before the or-
der was issued; I ought to have been present, either
in person or by counsel; and therefore I declare that
the order was contrary to law and justice, and res-
pectfully move the Court that it be rescinded.
   <i>Noah</i>—But, Mr. Attree, you may remember that
on the day of that trial I called you up to the side of
this bench to have some private conversation with
you, in the course of which you remarked to me
that you were about to officiate in the place of the
regular reporter.
   <i>Attree</i>—But if I did, that is not legal evidence that
I wrote the whole or any part of the report in ques-
tion, as it was published, of which the Court com-
plains. Nor does it do away with the illegality of ma-
king such an order when I was not present. It was like
trying a man without evidence; passing sentence
and punishment on him before he had been told that
there was any charge against him. It is like the fa-
bled Jedburgh law: hang first, and try afterwards.
(Tallmadge and the lawyers laughed. Lynch and
Noah frowned; although from the noise they could
not hear distinctly.) And the Court in thus acting
were following the bad precedent set them by the
Senate of this State, on punishing by removal, a
Judge without any trial or impeachment.
   <i>Noah</i>—Well, if the Court, then, are to understand
from you that you did not write the report, and if
you will reduce that statement to an affidavit, the
Court will not hesitate to rescind the order.
   <i>Attree</i>—May it please the Court, I shall do nothing
of the kind. The Court have thought proper to as-
sume, without legal evidence, that I did write it;
they did an illegal act on that assumption; and until
the Court rescind or expunge that illegal act, I stand
by that order, for the purpose of having it expunged.
I say it with all proper respect for the Court. (The
Recorder smiled.)
   <i>Noah</i>.—Well, Mr. Attree, but you must very well
know that if you did not write the report, you can
easily satisfy the court of the fact.
   <i>Attree</i>.—And his honor, judge Noah, also very
well knows, that I shall willingly do nothing of the
kind. His honor, Judge Noah, has too recently left
the ranks of the newspaper press, where he was a
titled officer—and where, with “all's fair in po-
litics” for his motto, he was in the daily habit of
ridiculing and slandering all who differed with
him—he was a soldier in the ranks of friends and
foes too long—he marched and countermarched
too often—he knew too many of the tricks of the
trade—he was too thoroughly conversant with the
machinery that regulates a newspaper office—not to
know that whatever transpires within such an office
never transpires out of it, except upon compulsion.
(Laughter among the lawyers.) I shall, in the pre-
sent state of the case, admit nothing—I shall deny
nothing; and I shall thereby most faithfully discharge
<d>[Col.3]</d>
my duty to him by whom I am employed. I must
insist again that the Court do rescind or expunge
that order, (at the mention of the word “expunge”
the Recorder, Whiting, and the lawyers laughed,)
because it was issued without first taking legal evi-
dence on the subject.
   <i>Noah</i>.—But, Mr. Attree, the Court inferred that
you wrote the article complained of.
   <i>Attree</i>.—The Court <i>inferred</i>; does the Court mean
to say that it acts upon an inference? Do I under-
stand the Court aright, when they say that they <i>in-
ferred</i> an offence had been committed by an individ-
ual, and therefore sentenced and punished him? The
Court might in this manner infer that other gentle-
men connected with other newspapers, wrote at dif-
ferent times, the several articles censuring certain
matters connected with this Court, such as the mode
of admitting to bail, &c., and therefore exclude
those gentlemen upon an <i>inference</i>. The Court might
as well <i>infer</i> that I wrote the report of the pork case.
(Laughter.) Whereas if the Court were to look a
little nearer themselves than I am, they might make
a nearer inference. But if this Court has acted in
my case upon a mere inference,—as I believe that it
this is the first transaction of the kind upon record in
the history of this Court, so I humbly and respectful-
ly trust it will be the last.
   Here Judge Noah seemed to think that he really
had committed a gross error in point of law, and he
remained silent.
   The Recorder smiled; but as the order was infor-
mal, and did not emanate from him, he determined
not to interfere. At last Noah went on:—
   <i>Noah</i>—But, Mr. Attree, you said in your paper of
to-day that his Honor the Recorder excepted to
the order. Such was not the fact.
   <i>Attree</i>—May it please the Court, I have no pa-
per of my own, nor any part of one—I am merely
employed to write for one paper. I regret to be un-
der the necessity of contradicting any member of the
Court; but his honor the Recorder assured me with
his own lips this morning, that Judge Noah wrote
the order, that he (the Recorder) knew nothing
about it, until he came to Court and found his opi-
nion overruled by Judges Lynch and Noah—that, as
the Judges consider the Aldermen elected by the
people as mere nobodies, they were not consulted;
that he (the Recorder) endeavored to persuade
Judge Noah not to make such an order, and further
said to him, “If you choose to make this display you
may be your own orator, for I <u>wont</u>;” and that he,
(the Recorder) further considered that I ought to
have been heard—and that as I was not, the order
was an <i>informal</i> one, and the proceedings informal;
which phrase, as connected with a court of law, I
understand to mean <i>illegal</i>. There sits his honor the
Recorder—you can ask him if he did not say so.
   <i>Recorder</i>—I did state to Mr. Attree that the order
was informal; but inasmuch as the order was sanc-
tioned by a majority of the Court, it was unquestiona-
bly the order of the Court, though informal.
   Here Judge Lynch, who had had a full head of
steam on for the last few minutes, commenced.
   <i>Lynch</i>—The Court, sir, thought proper to pass that
order in relation to the reporter, as the milder course;
this Court are determined not be trifled with by any
reporter, or by any newspaper. This Court do not
need any instructions from any quarter as to what are
and what are not his duties. The Court merely per-
mit the Reporters* to come here and sit where they
do; and if they do not behave themselves and make
proper reports, the Court can either expel them, or
commit them, as it thinks proper. You must be
aware, sir, that this Court can commit any one so
offending!
   <i>Attree</i>—I am perfectly well aware that this Court
can commit any individual who is guilty of a con-
tempt of court. But I am, also, equally well aware
that this Court must have sufficient legal evidence,
that the individual complained of has been guilty of
a contempt of Court. (The Recorder and District
Attorney smiled; and the latter observed, “If you
go on so, you'll puzzle the Judge.”)
   <i>Lynch</i>.—The Court consider that they had evi-
dence enough.
   <i>Attree</i>.—I respectfully differ with the Court.
   <i>Noah</i>.—But Mr. Attree you don't mean to contend
that the report in question was a correct report.
   <i>Attree</i>.—May it please the Court, I mean respect-
fully to contend that every iota of the evidence re-
lating to the stealing and receiving the coffee was
literally and strictly true; that the report was fuller,
better, and contained more facts than any other re-
port that was published in relation to the trial; and
with the exception of a few harmless remarks put
into the mouth of Judge Noah it<u>,</u> was literally and
strictly the most correct report published. And I wish
further to say, that the editorial introduction to the
article in the “Star” in relation to this order of which
I before complained, was grossly false in speaking
of the report.
   <i>Noah</i> (angrily and abruptly)—I have nothing to do
with writing in the “Star,”—or, with the “Star.”
   <i>Attree</i> (to one of the lawyers)—I don't believe it;
and John I. Mumford says that Noah is as much the
editor of the “Star” now as ever he was.
   <i>Noah</i>—Well, this Court merely permits the report-
ers to sit at that table provided for them; and if they
violate the rules of the Court they must take the
consequences. (A laugh among some of the report-
ers.)
   <i>Lynch</i> (looking very red and very angry)—Yes,
sir, and the Court will go further; and say that it is
determined to maintain its dignity in relation to the
press and to every one else. And <i>the Court</i> consider
that the very act of the reporter, against whom the
order was made, in coming into this Court room to-
day, and taking his seat at that table, in the very
face of the order of the Court, and as it were in de-
fiance of this Court, was an act of itself sufficient to
justify this Court in committing that reporter for
contempt.
   <i>Attree</i>—Why, the Court most strangely have con-
founded the whole matter. The Court, by an illegal
act, of which I complain, written and published by
one of the Judges, brings me a suitor at the bar of this
Court, against my will. I appear here in conse-
quence, as a suitor according to law, to enter my
protest against that act; I request permission to make
my motion consequent thereon, almost the instant
that the Court opens—I renew my applications—I am
put off from hour to hour by the Court—I am kept
here by the Court dancing attendance upon them
the whole day (when I have other and much more
important business to attend to for my employer)—
and after being kept in suspense the whole day, not
knowing at what moment the Court, in their wis-
dom and magnanimity, may think proper to call on
me to make my motion, I am graciously told, at ten
o'clock at night, by this honorable Court, that I have
been guilty of a contempt of Court, and deserve to be
committed to prison for having had the audacity to
wait here the whole day, in order to be heard in self-
defence! (Here the Recorder smiled, and the law-
yers could hardly refrain from bursting out into a
most unoriental roar of laughter, particularly Mr.
Whiting.) And in addition to this, I am bound to
state that his honor the Recorder asked me this
morning to take a seat anywhere within the bar of
this Court. There sits his honor, ask him if it is not
so. (<u title="Laughter">haughter</u> all round, except by Lynch or Noah.)
   <i>Attree</i>—Such is my peculiar position here now;
and before I sit down, I will respectfully endeavor to
undeceive the Court in relation to their assumption
of my position as a member of the press, and also
that of the gentlemen who sit here connected with
other papers. This Court has spoken of “its re-
porters.” Now, so far as I understand the newspa-
per business of this city, (and I have served an ardu-
ous, a thorough, a faithful, and a devoted apprentice-
ship to it,) this Court has really no reporters at-
tached to it, properly speaking. The various gentle-
men of talent who condescend to come here day by
day, and sit for hours to be bored with miserable
speeches, bad law, and worse logic (I mean no dis-
respect to the Court) do so, as I understand them, as
a special act of favor, to rescue the Court from com-
parative insignificance, and to prevent the transactions
of this noisy, ill-conditioned, ill-contrived and disa-
greeable Court, (I say it with all proper respect for
their honors the Judges) from being consigned to
utter oblivion. They are the representatives of the
great and generous public here—they have a sacred
right to be here, decreed to them by the constitution
of the country, which no power at present existing
in this great, this (in every sense of the word) glori-
ous and blessedly-free republic, can by any distortion
of law deprive them of. And under these circum-
stances they have virtually a right to every possible
accommodation and protection from the Court.
And I beg the Court distinctly to understand, that I
make these remarks entirely disconnected from any
personal feeling in the premises. I am not a report-
er of this Court, and if it was in the power of the
Court to pass a perpetual order to exclude me
from this Court altogether, and the Court were
to do so, I should respectfully esteem it a spe-
cial act of favor. So far as I alone am concerned,
the order of the Court is a matter of comparative
indifference to me. But so far as I am a member of
that press whose rights I consider have been violated
in my person, it is a matter of great moment to me.
It is the principle which I contend for. It is the
rights of every newspaper in the city that I wish to
call your attention to. If you act thus illegally to-
wards me to-day, you may to-morrow seize upon an
<i>attaché</i> of some other paper, and prescribe him, up-
on what Judge Noah calls an inference, as you have
endeavored to proscribe me. I desire that your ho-
nors should look at this matter calmly and dispas-
sionately. You have no right to infer or assume
who is and who is not the author of any article that
may appear in any paper, without legal evidence.
If a newspaper publishes what is punishable at
law, the proprietors of the papers in this city
are abundantly responsible for what they publish;
at least, such is the case with the establishment
to which I have the honor to belong. And I
wish your honors also to be disabused on this
point. I am not a reporter of this court; I have
no desire to be one. And if your honors were
to rescind or to expunge that order in relation to
myself—I say, if, by possibility you were to do it,
though I don't believe you will—I would not sit at
<m9>———
   * We understood him to say, “Do not allow that they
have the right to sit here!” But Judge Lynch has lost
his front teeth and lisps and mumbles so, that it is very
difficult to report him accurately in this noisy Court.</m9>
<d>[Col.4]</d>
that little dirty table again, (pointing to the little
two-feet six) were I to live to be the age of <u title="Methuselah">Methu-
saleh</u>. (Here Noah forgot the Judge, and put on
the Major, and smiled heartily.) Years ago, by be-
ing presumed to possess the requisite amount of tact
and talent, and by a proper and industrious exercise
of the faculties which God has given me, I was
raised far—far above the level of this court, to which
I think I can never descend again by any adverse
train of circumstances. I was raised to a seat in
one of those chairs from which his honor Judge
Noah has so recently descended to occupy a seat
upon this bench.—(Smiles and laughter.)—I mean
the editorial chair! I am satisfied with my situa-
tion, I do my duty industriously, I serve my employ-
er assiduously; and whilst I am satisfied in my own
mind that I have paid proper attention to <i>his</i> orders,
the unjust and informal orders of this or any other
court
	——“Pass by me as the idle wind
	Which I respect not.”
   This ended the proceedings for that night, as nei-
ther member of the court replied.

   T<small>HE</small> C<small>OURT OF</small> S<small>ESSIONS, ALIAS THE</small> H<small>ENROOST</small>
C<small>OURT</small>.—We have heard a great deal of folly lately
about the bringing of the administration of this Court
into contempt. Is it the Court or the members of
the Court (the Recorder and Aldermen excepted)
which bring the Court into contempt? Look at the
conduct of Lynch and Noah; see the mode adopted
by one of admitting rascals to bail and of senten-
cing criminals. One admits that terrible villain
Butcher Joe to bail, after the police magistrates had
refused to do so; Joe gets out, runs away, and it
costs $300 to catch him. And so with others.
   In sentencing, look at the inequality—take any day;
one steals a large amount of goods—he is imprisoned
for two months; one steals a less amount; he is im-
prisoned for six months or a year. One steals a lot
of pork, he is let off; one steals some old clo', and
he is sent up for the full term. One beats and nearly
kills his father; he is suffered to go free; another
takes some food to sustain life, or clothing to cover
her nakedness, (as in the cases before Noah on Tues-
day) and she or he is sent to the Penitentiary for
several months.
   And so it is with the administration of justice ge-
nerally. A highly respectable bank robber and ras-
cal, like Levis, may plunder the people with impu-
nity. A poor wretch, who steals food to save himself
from starving, is sure to be sent to prison for the full
term. It is high time that our Sessions Court was
reformed. The Recorder appears to have left the
bench in disgust; and with such miserable creatures
as Noah and Lynch, it is nonsense to talk about law
or dignity, or even common sense. One never knew
any thing about law—and the poorest practitioner
almost at the bar of that court knows more law and
better law than the other.
   The scene yesterday, with able lawyers like Whi-
ting, Graham, Brady and O'Conner, pleading before
two such thick headed numskulls as Noah and Lynch,
was enough to sicken any one for a century.

tions of a very sickly season in the city this sum-
mer, but, so far, we have never known a more
gratifying state of the public health at midsum-
mer. Last week the interments in the city amoun-
ted to only 105—a decrease of two upon the num-
ber of the previous week. Of the whole number,
30 were men, 20 women, 34 boys, 21 girls; 35 un-

she was sent to the Penitentiary for 30 days.
   Mat Conlan, a small boy, was sent to the House of Re-
fuge.
   Kate Murphy stole a small chair, and she was sent to
the Island for 30 days.
   Jem Hackett and Bill Walker, the two soaplocks who
did the Green Mountain Boy out of $10 by dropping a
pocket book, were sent to dig stone for six months.
   <i>Rowdies</i>.—Bartley Friel was tried for kicking a woman,
but acquitted.
   Bill Handley, struck Ann Henson and was sent up for
sixty days.
   Peter Vance was tried for whipping John Perry, and
sent up for fifteen days.
   Three soaplocks and one nymph of the pave were dis-
charged with a recommendation to join the Teetotal So-
ciety. Two Irish servant girls, who were arrested for ta-
king moonlight walks with their lovers, were discharg-
ed with a caution not to do so again, and the Court ad-
journed <i>sine die</i>.

			<b>City Intelligence.</b>
   M<small>ORE</small> T<small>RICKS UPON</small> T<small>RAVELLERS</small>.—If there is any city or
corporate town either in the Old or New World, where
strangers are more easily victimized and robbed, more
openly than in this good and moral city of Gotham, it has
never been our good or ill fortune to sojourn therein.—
Day after day cases occur at the Police, which mani-
fest the necessity of a Day Police or Patrol, especially at
the wharves, railroad and packet stations; but none of
the authorities endeavor to get a preventative police ap-
pointed. A few days since a poor immigrant named Da-
niel Wood, arrived here from Liverpool in the ship Lau-
ra, and before he had been three hours in the city he was
pounced upon by a soaplock, supposed to be, one John
Hawkins, who proffered his services to show the stranger
some place to which he was directed to apply for infor-
mation concerning his friends in America. The soaplock
led the helpless stranger through lanes and blind alleys,
until he found himself in a wood yard, when the soaplock
robbed his victim of all the money he had about him,
knocked the poor devil down and fled. Two days after
he met the same rascal in the streets, and brought him
by force to the Police, but the probability is that he will
escape by proving an <i>alibi</i>.
   S<small>USANNAH AND THE</small> E<small>LDER</small>.—A nymph of the pave who
called herself Susannah Reed, was brought up, charged
as a disorderly person, she being caught by the watch in
a very peculiar situation with an elderly gentlemanly
man, who was not in custody. The Magistrate having
elicited from the watch the particulars of Susannah's <i>faux
pas</i>, which occurred in the Park, sent that young lady to
the Island for thirty days. Susannah said as she left the
bar, that she was another proof of the injustice of the
laws, which always punished the least guilty, and per-
mitted the male animals to escape.

		<m8>Reported for the Courier & Enquirer.</m8>
   <i>An Incident</i>.—In the Court of Special Sessions,
yesterday, a man named John Fisher, was brought
up, for some trifling offence, for trial. His wife,
a beautiful young woman not more than seventeen
years of age, appeared at the bar with an infant
in her arms, as the advocate of her husband.—
She was dressed plainly, and by no means in the
height of fashion. Her presence, her child and her
tears had a softening effect on the Court. The hus-
band was discharged and left the room. The young
wife lingered behind to sob out a few sentences of
gratitude. Judge Noah spoke to her a few kind
words, and enquired of her “are you really so des-
titute as you appear, and is that your child?” “As
there's a God<u title=",” "> </u>replied the poor creature<u title=", “">” </u>it is all true.
Since my husband has been in prison for triflingly
offending against the dignity of our Landlord the
latter, the inhuman monster, had turned me and my
child out of doors, and retained for his rent, as he
claims our all—little all. For four days I have with
my child subsisted in the open air, depending wholly
upon the cold charity of such as chanced to pass by
betimes<u title=".”">.</u>
   This was more than Judge Noah could stand with
his face concealed from the gaze of the spectators,
to conceal an evident emotion, he beckoned to the
pour woman, who, as she approached him, he slipped
into her hand a <i>five dollar note</i>, which he drew from
his pocket, and wishing her better success and hap-
piness hereafter. She left the Court with an altered
countenance. The Judge adjusted his spectacles,
called the Court to order, and the business pro-
ceeded.

   <i>Ezra White</i>.—This distinguished individual, who
has recently taken up his residence at Sing Sing, has
proved himself a most expert workman, in the line of
carpet weaving. Capt. Smith of the Police, on Thurs-
day brought down a specimen in the form of a hearth
rug of the most exquisite workmanship and finish.—
The article may be seen by the curious in such mat-
ters, at the store of Lemuel Philips, 235 Pearl street.

   <i>Sing Sing Statistics</i>.—Officer A. M. C. Smith,
who yesterday returned from the State Prison at Sing
Sing, reports that during the month of June ultimo,
six persons were discharged, their time having ex-
pired. There were remaining in Prison, men 766,
women 68—total, 834.

   <i>Inquest</i>.—The Coroner, yesterday, held an inquest
at the City Hospital, on the body of John Campbell,
a laborer, born in Ireland, aged 40 years. Deceased
was on Thursday employed upon a church in pro-
gress of erection, corner of Broome and Elizabeth
sts. He became very much heated and drank freely
of cold water, after which he was taken suddenly ill,
with fits and spasms. He was taken to the Hospi-
tal, where he shortly after expired—Verdict, death
from congestion of the brain, caused by drinking
cold water.

			<b>General Sessions.</b>
<m9>Present the Recorder, Judges Lynch and Noah, and two
			Aldermen.
   The following gentlemen were sworn of the grand
jury:
   Philip Henry, foreman, Calvin Candit, Saml. F. Mott,
Charles Sandford, Joseph Whitfield, Bernard Graham,
Hamilton Murray, Anthony V. Winans, James Paton,
Henry Champrey, Francis Clark, Joseph F. Atwill, John
Milpar, Richard P. Lawrence, Wm. L. Rushton, Saml. S.
Rockwell, James Leary, and Ben. Richards.
   The jurors having been sworn, Judge Lynch procee-
ded to charge the grand inquest on the five statutory pro-
visions which it is incumbent on this court to bring
monthly to the notice of the grand inquest, to wit:—The
gross impropriety of taking more than seven per cent for
the usance of money—the palpable immorality of lotte-
ries—the necessity of preserving the election laws in-
violate—the folly of erecting wooden buildings this side
of the fire limits—and lastly, the necessity of the grand
inquest keeping their own secrets.
   His honor having delivered himself on these fruitful
topics, then proceeded to inform the grand jurors that a
certain newspaper was daily published in this city, cal-
led the Morning Herald. That some reporter employed
on said wicked newspaper, had brought this court into
contempt by misreporting a certain trial of one Thomas
Ritchie. That this court had then, in the exercise of its
sound discretion, proceeded to expel some one reporter of
said Morning Herald from a seat at the reporters' table.
The Court might have acted summarily in the matter, and
committed the author of said report to close custody; but
did not proceed to that extremity. After this, a series of
articles had been levelled at this Court, which had been
noticed in a letter written by the petit jury, which letter
would have been lain before the last grand jury if there
had been sufficient time. The Court would now remark
that in calling the attention of the grand jury to this sub-
ject, that if a true bill should be found against the editor
of the Herald, it would be sent for trial to the Court of
Oyer and Terminer, which tribunal had concurrent ju-
risdictions in such matters.
   And this court could not help remarking that the pro-
ceedings of courts of justice must not be ridiculed by the
press, and that if such ridicule was perpetrated it was the
bounden duty of the grand jury to sustain the dignity of
the courts, and to see that their deliberations were treat-
ed with that forbearance and respect to which they were
entitled.
   Judge Lynch, having made this special charge, left
the Bench to the care of the Recorder, Judge Noah and
Alderman <u>Baylis</u>.
   D<small>ISORDERLY</small> H<small>OUSES</small>.—Mary Layton, an ill-looking
specimen of the softer part of our species, was put to the
bar, charged with keeping a disorderly house in Water
street. Benj. F. Parker, officer of the 4th Ward, proved
that the prisoner kept a house of ill-fame in that Ward. It
was a noisy concern, frequented by sailors and women,
who committed every crime except murder, and even that
crime might have been perpetrated, for the Coroner had
been called to the house.
   District Attorney—Is she married?
   Witness—Well, I know Layton, and I know another
man who has lived with her.
   Prisoner—Come, Mr. Parker, don't you be too hard,
for you know I was respectable a year ago, at Brooklyn.
   Witness—Oh! I don't know as how I can be too hard,
Mary.
   The prisoner made no defence on the merits, and the
jury found her guilty.
   William Langdon was next put to the bar for a similar
offence, and acquitted through a flaw in the indictment.
   Their Honors then adjourned.</m9>

<b>Amusing Business in the Sessions—A New
			<u>Bull</u> against the Herald.</b>
   The unconstitutional portion of the Court of Ses-
sions (that portion not recognised by the Corporation)
composed of two worn-out politicians, Messrs. Noah
and Lynch, presented a curious scene yesterday.
   It appears by our report in another column, that
Judge Lynch charged the Grand Jury to bring in a
bill of indictment against the Herald, because it had
brought his side of the Court into contempt—and
also, because our reports of their petit larceny pro-
ceedings are incorrect and erroneous.
   If the Grand Jury examine the matter closely, we
imagine they will find that Judges Noah and Lynch
have brought themselves into contempt, if such be
the fact in the case as they <u title="=allege">alledge</u>. They made them-
selves ridiculous by issuing a pompous bulletin against
a reporter, for some mistake they alleged he made
in a report of the trial of a common thief, and now
they have followed this Pompolino business up, by
charging the Grand Jury to indict the Herald for
publishing these mistakes and errors.
	...
   The Corporation of this city denies the legality of
the appointment of Noah and Lynch—and will not
pay their salaries, except on compulsion. In this
opinion they were sustained by a large majority of the
people at the last election. Is this indictable? And
will the grand jury indict 23,000 voters? We have
no doubt, but, at the next session of the legislature,
that body will abolish the offices of Noah and Lynch
outright. Is this opinion also indictable?
	...
He is totally unfit for the seat he fills. Judge Lynch
is a little more of a lawyer, but he wants the temper
and attainments to place his portion of the Court of
Sessions as high in reputation as Judge Mansfield
once did his Court. On many occasions he admits
persons to bail, on writs of <i>habeas corpus</i>, that he
ought not to have done either in equity or in law.
Such is our belief—is that a crime? We go no fur-
ther than the recent case of the person accused of
burning the National Theatre, which we believe is
not a bailable offence in law, and yet was bailed for
$1,000 by Judge Lynch, so that any other theatre
that is ready to be burned down, can now have a
chance to effect such a piece of business.
	...
We yield to none in a reverence for an enlightened,
learned, and courteous administration of justice, in
every court and on every bench; but we should be
sorry to think for one moment, that the reputation of
our ordinary courts of law, or the dignity and learn-
ing of our criminal bench, were entirely dependent
on the learning and fitness of M. M. Noah and his
coadjutor. If we are to be indicted and punished
for this opinion, come on at once. We should give
up our life at the stake sooner than believe that the
elevation and dignity of the criminal bench of New
York depended on the learning and sense of the
same individual who attempted, from Grand Island,
a few years ago, to palm a gross imposture on the
Hebrew people—the same individual too, who, du-
ring an editorial life of twenty-five years, did more
than any other man of his age, to bring religion, mo-
rals, politics and society into contempt, by every
species of low wit and ribaldry—the same individual
too, who, no later than last year, while he was editor
of the “Evening Star,” made a series of ferocious
attacks on ex-Recorder Morris, and endeavored to
bring into contempt a man and a judge that is truly
an ornament of society, and of the legal institutions
of the land. If the grand jury find any bill, it ought
to be a bill against this very personage, against whom
there is a sentence still hanging over his head in his
own Court, for breaking open the seal of another
man's letter.
   But we understand all this movement—it is the
last and cheapest edition—a sort of an Extra, price
one penny, of the “moral war,” and it will end as
that did, in the total overthrow of its projectors.—
We shall now go, tooth and nail, for the repeal of
the unconstitutional law, under which these two
judges sit on the bench, and shall never give it up,
until the venerated form of the ancient Court of Ses-
sions be restored to New York.

	GENERAL SESSIONS—Yesterday.
   The following gentlemen were duly <u title="empanelled">enpanel-
led</u> and sworn as a Grand Jury for the term:
     Philip Henry, foreman, Calvin Candit, Samuel F.
Mott, Charles Sandford, Joseph Whitfield, Bernard
Graham, Hamilton Murray, Anthony V. Winans,
James Paton, Henry Champrey, Francis Clark,
Joseph F. Atwill, John Milpar, Richard P. Lawrence,
Wm. L. Rushton, Samuel S. Rockwell, James Leary,
Benj. Richards.
   In the course of the charge to the Grand Jurors,
Judge Lynch (who delivered the charge) called the
attention of the panel to the “Herald” newspaper, in
the following terms.
   “During the last June term, one James Ritchie
was tried and convicted on one indictment for grand
larceny, and on another for receiving stolen goods,
knowing them to have been stolen. In professing to
give a report of the proceedings in one of these tri-
als, a newspaper printed in the city of New York,
called the <i>New York Herald</i>, contained various false
statements, for which this Court unanimously made
an order dismissing from the table, appropriated for
the use of the Reporters, the person who reported for
that paper.
   “In other numbers of the same paper, further false
reports of the proceedings and decisions of this court
appeared, to which were added reflections personally
upon the members of the Court.”
   [Judge Lynch then proceeded to state that he thus
called the attention of the Grand Jurors, at the es-
pecial instance and request of the petit Jurors who
had served during the June term, and who had felt
themselves aggrieved and insulted by the false and
ridiculous reports of the Herald.] He then proceed-
ed as follows.
   “In this country, it has seldom been found neces-
sary for Courts to protect themselves against such
publications by punishing the guilty parties for a con-
tempt. It has generally happened that a portion of
the press which is properly conducted, has furnished
a corrective, sufficient for all useful purposes,
against the licentiousness of any other portion of it,
by exposing the offender at the bar of public opinion.
But when an Editor has placed himself or is placed
by circumstances, in such a situation that the press
at large will not notice his effusions, and particular-
ly in cases palpably false, where statements of the
proceedings and decisions of this court are published,
by which a portion of the public might be misled,
the Court do not feel themselves at liberty any long-
er to omit to notice such libellous publications, low
and vulgar though they be.
   Taking into consideration the complaint made by
so respectable a portion of our citizens as the mem-
bers of the petit Jury, I have referred to, and also that,
if the accused should be convicted on an indictment,
the law provides a greater latitude of punishment, and
therefore that the measure of it might be better adapt-
ed to the degree of the offence, the Court instead of
adopting summary proceedings as for a criminal con-
tempt, have thought proper to call your attention to
the subject, and have directed the District Attorney
to lay the papers before you, in full confidence that
you will give it the consideration to which it is enti-
tled. If a bill should be found it will best comport
with the wishes of this Court, that it should be sent
to the Court of Oyer and Terminer, for trial, which
has concurrent jurisdiction.
   In every well ordered community, Courts and Ju-
ries should be protected in the fearless and conscien-
tious discharge of their duties; if those who are
charged with the administration of the laws, may be
assailed with impunity, with the shafts of malice or
ridicule, good order and decorum will be violated and
the ends of justice may be defeated<u title=".”">.</u>
   Mary Layton was tried and convicted of keeping a
disorderly house.
   William Langdon was tried on a similar charge and
acquitted, and there being no other cases ready for
trial, the court adjourned.

   J<small>UDGE</small> L<small>YNCH</small>—A<small>NOTHER</small> C<small>ONTEMPT</small>.—On refer-
ence to the report of the proceedings in the “Board
of Supervisors” yesterday, it will be seen that that
body refused, by a vote of 11 to 8, to pay Judge
Lynch any salary for his services in the Sessions.—
This refusal is made on the ground that his appoint-
ment was unconstitutional, and that he has earned
no salary. Judge Noah has not yet presented his
claim, but when it is, he will meet with the same re-
fusal.
   If the Grand Jury be now deliberating on the
subject of “contempts of courts,” here is a case for
them. How can a judge be treated more contempt-
uously than to be refused his salary—to be told,
“Sir, your services are useless—your appointment
is illegal, and you yourself not wanted—make your-
self scarce.” This would seem to be the acme of
contempt—and if the charge of Judge Lynch be
followed, the Grand Jury ought to indict the “Board
of Supervisors” at once, for committing a most hein-
ous contempt.

<d>[Col.4]</d>
			<b>Board of Supervisors.</b>
<m9>   Yesterday at 12 o'clock this body convened. Present
his honor the Mayor, his honor the Recorder, and seven-
teen Aldermen. His honor the Mayor took the chair,
and directed the minutes of the last meeting to be read.
   There being no objection to the minutes, they were
confirmed.
   His honor the Mayor said he had a communication
from John C. Spencer, in relation to the persons to be
elected to the Asylum for the Blind—Referred.
   An application from A. M. C. Smith, for the payment of
$249 38, being expenses incurred in relation to the trial
of James B. Glentworth. Several members objected to
the charge as <u title="exorbitant">exhorbitant</u>, and the application was re-
fused.
   His honor the Mayor said he had a claim from the
three judges of the Common Pleas, for serving on the
bench of the Court of Sessions from the time Judge Sand-
ford resigned until Judge Noah was appointed. These
claims were as follows:<table style="white-space:normal;font-size:90%;margin-left:3em">
<tr><td style="width:15em">Judge Ulshoeffer,</td> <td align=right>$176</td></tr>
<tr><td>Judge <u>Ingliss</u>,</td> <td align=right>244</td></tr>
<tr><td>Judge Ingraham,</td> <td align=right>108</td></tr>
<tr><td> </td> <td align=right>——<br>$528</td></tr></table>
   This claim was referred to Aldermen Leonard, Purdy,
and Kimball.
   An application was made from Edward Sandford, ex-
judge of the Sessions, for the payment of $719, being the
amount of his salary due, together with the costs incur-
red in the prosecution of a suit against the Corporation.
   This claim was referred to Aldermen Leonard, Purdy,
and Kimball.
   An application was made from Charles Taylor, for the
payment of $80, being his charge for ten days board for
four police officers, during the Aqueduct riots, at <i>two dol-
lars per diem for each police officer</i>. A member asked if the
$2 per diem included every charge, as he believed it was
more than was charged at the first hotels in the city.
   Another member said this was one of the most out-
rageous charges he had ever met with; police officers,
employed at $5 per day, to send in a bill of $80 for their
ten days' feed at a tavern!
   The application was then <u title="referred">refered</u> to a committee.
   His honor the Mayor then introduced the following
preamble and resolution:—
   Whereas, the law establishing the offices of associate
judges of the Court of General Sessions of the Peace, in
and for the city and county of New York, and giving to
each said Judge the annual salary of $2000, was passed
without being applied for by the city authorities, and is
against the wishes of the inhabitants; and whereas, also,
the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of James
Lynch vs. the Aldermen and Commonalty of the city of
New York, indicates that the law, so far at least as the ap-
pointment of said judges and the payment of said sala-
ries, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=iXZZAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA257" title="Chap.311, §5: ...associate judges...shall receive each a yearly salary of two thousand dollars, to be paid...out of the city treasury in quarterly payments...">is obligatory upon the city of New York</a>, and the sala-
ry may be by suit recovered against the city of New
York, with costs; and whereas, also, it is the duty of the
Board of Supervisors to obey the law, when constitution-
ally made, and prevents costs being made to the city, so
long as said law exists.
   Now therefore,
   Resolved, That we do not approve of nor sanction said
law, and hope for its repeal.
   Resolved, That the comptroller of the city be and
hereby is directed to pay the salaries of said Associate
Judges of the Court of Sessions, in accordance with the
act entitled “<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=CZ1DAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA265" title="Chap.276, §4: The arrears of salary of the associate judges...shall be deemed county charges...and the mayor...shall audit and allow the account for such arrears...">An act to enable the Supervisors of the City
and County of New York to raise money by tax</a>” passed
May 26, 1841.
   Alderman Purdy said, he agreed partly with the
preamble, and he denied part. For instance, he denied
that the Supreme Court had passed on this matter at all.
   The Mayor said the preamble only said the Court had
indicated such an opinion.
   Alderman Purdy thought the Judge should be left to
his remedy at common law, for if the City Authorities
held themselves to be governed by constitutions or char-
ters, then they were not bound to pay the Judge. Here
the worthy Alderman cited the city charter, and con-
tended that, under that instrument no money could be
drawn from the City Treasury, unless previously ap-
propriated by the Common Council. He also contended,
that no such money could be legally paid, even if all
the judicial tribunals, and all the lawyers in the world
were to say the contrary.
   A number of amendments to the original preamble
were then read, discussed, and passed, which resulted
in the following amendments, which were adopted by
eleven ayes and eight nays.
   First. It was moved and carried, to strike out all that
part of the preamble after the word “authorities” in the
fifth line down to the word “costs.”
   Secondly. To insert the words people of the city and
county of New York, or the representatives in the State
Legislature from this city.
   So that the preamble when amended, would read,
   Whereas, the law establishing the offices of associate
judges of the Court of General Sessions of the Peace, in
and for the city and county of New York, and giving to
each said Judge the annual salary of $2000, was passed
without being applied for by the city authorities, the
people of the city and county of New York, or the re-
presentatives in the State Legislature from this city; and
whereas, also, it is the duty of the Board of Supervisors
to obey the law, when constitutionally made, and pre-
vents costs being made to the city, so long as said law
exists.
   Alderman Benson moved to strike out the whole of the
preamble, which was lost.
   Alderman Purdy moved, that as amended it be adopted.
Carried, 11 ayes to 8 nays.
   Alderman Lee moved to strike out the two resolutions,
and to insert as an amendment the following:—
   Resolved, That inasmuch as the law creating the two
Associate Judges of the Court of Sessions, passed 1840,
was in violation of the rights of the city of New York,
guaranteed to it by the State Constitution and City
charter, therefore the Board of Supervisors decline pay-
ing the salaries of the Judges appointed under that law.
   This resolution was lost by eleven nays to eight ayes.
   The question was then taken on the adoption of the
two resolutions appended to the preamble of his Honor
the Mayor, when it appeared that both were negatived
by a majority of <i>three</i>.
   Alderman Purdy moved that the whole proceedings on
this subject, reports, votes, &c. &c. be published, which
motion was carried <i>nem con</i>.
   And the Board adjourned.</m9>

	<b>Governor Seward and his Policy.</b>
   The short-sighted and narrow-minded policy of
Governor Seward is now beginning to <u title="develop">develope</u> their
injurious effects in this city, in the broadest and bold-
est characters.
   His illegal and unconstitutional interference with
the Court of Sessions—his arbitrary removal of Re-
corder Morris and Judge Scott—his appointment of
Noah and Lynch to offices for which they are unfit,
both in temper and attainments—his other appoint-
ments to office, of men notoriously unfit in every
point of character—his attempt to destroy the integ-
rity and efficiency of the Fire Department—but,
above and beyond all, his effort to subvert the pre-
sent Public School System, and to set all the differ-
ent sects of Christianity at variance with each other,
are some of the evils of his administration of the
State government.
   On the last subject, an event has taken place that
would signalize the middle ages better than the pre-
sent day, in the midst of an enlightened community.
   A Protestant clergyman, discussing a public ques-
tion, in one of his own churches, has been assailed
with hisses, and forced to leave the pulpit, in conse-
quence of a crowd of persons, principally of Catho-
lics, differing in opinion with him, and thus resent-
ing his attacks on their creed and their sect. The
spirit of religious agitation and religious persecution
has been revived in our day, in almost as violent a
manner as in that of Luther or Calvin.
   This unfortunate state of things has been entirely
produced by the folly and weakness of Governor
Seward, in attempting to legislate for the gratifica-
tion of a sect instead of a whole people. He has
thrown into the public arena the hand grenade of
religious agitation, and who can now tell when it is
to cease?
   On this, and on several other accounts, we are
afraid that the period of Mr. Seward's term in office
will only be remembered for its folly, its rashness,
its unthinking attempt to meddle with sound princi-
ples and established institutions, merely to subserve
the fleeting popularity of a sect, a clique, or a day.

	COURT OF SESSIONS—Yesterday.
Before the Recorder, Judges Noah and Lynch, and

   Peter E. <u>Burton</u> (boy) was next tried for a burglary
in the 3d degree, in breaking into the store of Wm. S.
Wooster, No. 308 Second st., on the night of the 13th
of June last, and stealing therefrom $<u>5</u> in copper

the act, and in extenuation said he found the store
door open; but on examining him at the watch
house, a skeleton key was found upon him, which
fitted the lock of the store.
   For the defence Alfred Crommelin deposed that he
has known the prisoner for a number of years, and
has always found him to be perfectly honest. Mr.
Shaler as counsel for the accused, contended that
there was no proof that the accused opened the door
of the store. And under the charge of the Court the
jury found the prisoner guilty of petit larceny only.

   G<small>OVERNOR</small> S<small>EWARD, AND THE</small> A<small>NTI</small>-M<small>ASONIC</small> F<small>AC-
TION</small>.—The detestable, religious agitation encou-
raged and fomented by Governor Seward, is begin-
ning to open all eyes to his course of policy, to his
advisers—and to their origin and character in for-
mer days.
   The Seward <i>clique</i> is only the old anti-masonic
faction, whose hypocrisy, tyranny, folly and reck-
lessness, formerly marred the prosperity of western
New York for many years. The same spirit has
characterised the state government since their ac-
cession to power in Albany.
   Seward and his <i>clique</i> first passed the Free Bank
Law, which destroyed the currency of the State,
blew up twenty-three banks, and saddled the peo-
ple with millions of dollars in losses—in broken bills,
and fraudulent post notes. Secondly—they have
increased the State debt nearly $30,000,000 in three
years, without any increased advantage. Thirdly,
they have wasted the credit of the state upon spe-
culative railroads, and denied it to those that were
useful. Fourthly, they have appointed persons to
lucrative offices, for violating the laws, and pipe-
laying at the polls. Fifthly, they have impaired the
respectability of the Court of Sessions, and violated
the charter, by appointing two incompetent men,
Noah and Lynch, to act as judges. Sixthly, they
have attempted to destroy, by making it political,
the Fire Department of New York. Seventhly,
they have opened the floodgates of religious excite-
ment, and sought to break down the Public School
system, in order to gratify a single sect, at the ex-
pense of all the rest. And eighthly, they are now
seeking to enact an alien and <u title="seditious">sedition</u> law against
the liberty of the press, through the operation of a
pair of incompetent and unconstitutional judges of
the Sessions, who have the audacity to charge jurors
to bring in bills for contempt.
   If ever a great city and a mighty state have been
disgraced by a faction, it has been the city and
state of New York, by the wicked and unprincipled
measures and appointments, proceeding from Go-
vernor Seward and the anti-masonic faction that
rules at Albany.

	<b>Meeting of the Board of Supervisors.</b>
   A meeting of this body took place yesterday, and
as a long and violent discussion was expected, rela-
tive to the payment of the salary of Mr. Lynch, cal-
led by some Judge Lynch, there was a full attend-
ance.
	...
   Here some one presented a bill from John Davis,
<i>for cleaning, sweetening and purifying the Court of
Sessions. Price</i> $23.
   This bill raised a pretty general laugh; and some
one said, “Well then, it appears, after all, that the
remarks of the “Herald” were right; that the ses-
sions was a dirty and disagreeable court, if it cost
$23 to clean it!”
   Ald. Lee—For cleaning what sir? (Laughter.)
   Mayor—The Court of Sessions!
   Voice—That wanted cleansing.
   Alderman—Who certifies to it, sir.
   Mayor—Recorder Tallmadge. (Laughter.) What's
the pleasure of the board.
   Alderman—Move paid. Carried.
   Mayor—Here's a bill of the Coroner.
   Aldermen—For how much.
   Mayor—$1,236 12¼, and here's $5 added.
	...
   Finally, it was referred to a committee, with pow-
er to pay. Aldermen of the 10th, 14th and 15th
were the committee.
   Ald. Purdy.—I have here a bill from Ex-Sheriff
Acker for $1,196.
	...
   Benson.—Move—referred—same committee.
   Mayor.—With power?
   Benson.—No, sir, (rather roughly, but good hu-
moredly.)
   Purdy.—I should have no objection; but part of
it is due to the newspapers for advertising, and the
printers want their money, and I want them paid.
   Mayor.—We shall meet again to-morrow.
   The bill was referred, and then re-considered.
   Ald. Purdy.—The printers want their money, and
I want to see them paid; therefore I want the bill
acted upon.
   Ald. Lee.—So do other people want their money,
I suppose.
   Ald. Leonard.—There's none due any one else;
all the rest goes to the Sheriff, for charges. And I
understand he's in arrears to the Corporation some
$3,000 or $4,000; and it's time he paid that, before
we vote him any more money. (Laughter.)
	...
   Here Ald. Bradhurst made his appearance; and
presented a bill for carriage hire, for taking Justice
Murphy and men out to the Harlem war. It was
referred.
   Here the Lynchites were afraid the defenders of
the city charter and state constitution would outvote
them on the subject of <i>Mister</i> Lynch's (commonly
called Judge Lynch) salary, and they moved a re-
cess till to-day, at 12 o'clock; which was carried.
After which, the meeting adjourned, and then there
was a great deal of chaffing among the members of
the Board.

================================================================
<d>[Col.4]</d>
   <i>Trial of Madame Restell</i>.—The District Attorney called on
the trial of Caroline Lohman, alias Ann Lohman, alias Madame
Restell, indicted for a misdemeanor in producing a premature
and unnatural birth of Mrs. Ann Maria Purdy, wife of William
W. Purdy, late of the corner of Broome-street and the Bowery,
on the 20th July, 1839; and after the formality of swearing triers,
challenging jurors, &c., in order to obtain impartial men to try
the issue, a jury was at length obtained to try the case. Mr.
La Forge, associate Counsel, opened the case on the part of the
prosecution, and stated that the indictment contained two counts,
one for administering medicines on the 2d June to produce the
effect sought, and the other for producing the premature birth,
on the 20th July, 1839.
   William W. Purdy deposed that he was the husband of Ann
Maria Purdy, and was married the 26th November, 1837; that
she is now dead, having died at Newark, N. J., on the 28th of
April last. Saw her affix her name to certain depositions taken
before Justice Merritt on the 22d March last, and also to another
affidavit sworn to on the 5th April last. He lived with his wife
up to the time of her death, and was never absent from her a
single night, except when she went to Philadelphia last sum-
mer, by the advice of a physician, for the benefit of her health.
She had a gold watch and some gold rings when witness mar-
ried her. She was a clerk in a confectionery store in Pearl-st.
Had one living child by her. She was never well after the
miscarriage with the second, in July, <u title="1839">1830</u>.
   Henry W. Merritt, Police Justice, deposed that the two de-
positions of Mrs. Purdy, dated the 22d March, 1841, were taken
and subscribed before him at the residence of Mrs. Purdy, cor-
ner of Broome st. and the Bowery, in the presence of the accu-
sed, who was informed of her right to have counsel and to cross
examine Mrs. Purdy, who was sick and confined to her bed.—
The accused said her counsel, (Mr. <u>Morrell</u>) would come; but
he did not, and she asked Mrs. P. several questions (substan-
tially only one) which were not taken down, as the same ques-
tion had been asked Mrs. Purdy before in her direct examina-
tion. The object in taking the accused to Mrs. Purdy's resi-
dence was that the latter might identify the accused.
   [The District Attorney then proposed to read the affidavits of
Mrs. Purdy, taken before Justice Merritt on the 22d March last,
to which Messrs. Jordan and <u>Morrell</u>, the counsel for the accu-
sed objected, and the argument as to the admission of the affi-
davits as evidence, is to come <u>on on</u> Thursday (this day) at 11
o'clock. On the admission of these the whole case rests. The
Court then adjourned.]

			<b>General Sessions.</b>
Present—the Recorder, Judge Noah, and two Aldermen.
   J<small>ULY</small> 14.—Ezekiel Petty, indicted for a misdemeanor in
selling lottery policies, pleaded guilty to the charge. Sa-
rah Purnell also pleaded guilty to a similar charge.
   <i>Madame Restell's Case</i>.—Caroline Ann Lohman, alias
Madame Restell, came into Court and was arraigned in
due form. The fair accused was attired in the most ele-
gant manner, in a black satin walking dress, white satin
bonnet, of the cottage pattern, and a very elegant white
veil of Brussels lace. In her hand she carried a parcel
of printed papers, which made some persons mistake her
for the lady Presidentess of the Tract Society.
   Messrs. <u>Jordon</u> and Morrill, counsel for the accused
said that as this case had made some noise in the world,
it was their intention to examine the Jury pretty strictly,
and they wished to have <u title="triers">tryers</u> sworn as to the compe-
tency of the jurors.
   The Court appointed and swore Charles O'Conner and
Mr. E. J. Porter as <u title="triers">tryers</u>.
   William K. Asher was then called, and examined
touching his competency to serve as a juror.
   Asher said he had read a good deal against the accus-
ed, and nothing in her favor; but he was not prejudiced
either pro. or con.—so he was admitted.
   Horace Hays was next called and admitted, as also Je-
remiah R. Field.
   James E. Rogers said he had formed an opinion, and
was rejected.
   William Brown had formed an opinion, so he was let
off.
   George Andrew had no prejudice, and was sworn.
   Moses B. Depau said he had not heard much about the
lady, and hardly knew there was such a person. He
was sworn.
   William A. Tyler had formed an opinion, and was re-
jected.
   Elijah Haller had no opinion about it, so he was sworn.
   Bernard Sheridan said the matter had been much talk-
ed over in his family, but he had so little recollection
about it, that he had no opinion at all—so he was sworn.
   William T. Hemmingway had no prejudice, and was
admitted.
   Elisha P. Delaplaine said he had read a good deal of
stuff about it, which had influenced his mind. So he
was let off.
   James Cowles said he was quite indifferent—and he
was sworn.
   Lathrop L. Sturgiss confessed to a prejudice, and was
excused.
   Ezekiel Weed had no prejudice, so he was sworn.
   John C. Dowling had made up his mind, and was
let off.
   Israel Isaacs had not a thought unfavorable to Madame
Restell—so he was taken.
   Richard Elsey, had made up his mind—so he was ex-
cused.
   William K. Shaw had formed his opinion, and was also
excused.
   John Conway said he was prejudiced, and was excused.
   John Duncan had got an opinion ready made. He was
let off.
   Charles Crane had read newspaper reports somewhat
unfavorable to Madame Restell, but they did not make
much impression on his mind. He was admitted to serve
on the jury.
   As he was the twelfth man, the jury was held to be
complete, and all sworn.
   The indictment was then read to the jury. It contains
two counts, charging the accused with a misdemeanor,
in attempting to produce an abortion on the person of
Anna Maria Purdy, on the 2d of June and 22d of July 1840.
   William W. Purdy examined by the District Attorney.
—I was the husband of Anna Maria Purdy. She died at
Newark the 28th of April last. I was present at the ex-
amination taken by Justice Merritt.
   District Attorney—Did you see your wife sign this de-
position?
   Jordan—He saw her sign the paper shown him,
perhaps.
   District Attorney—Well, what does it matter? He saw
her sign the paper. Now will the officers send for Jus-
tice Merritt?
   Jordan—Mr. Purdy, I'll take the liberty of asking you
a few questions: did you and your wife live together in
1839.
   Witness—Why, we never lived or slept apart, sir.
   Jordan—What, did you live together before you were
married?
   Witness—No Sir.
   Jordan—When were you married<u>.</u>
   Witness—The 26th November, 1837.
   Jordan—Where did you live in June, 1839<u>.</u>
   Witness—Either in May or June we broke up house-
keeping and went to board in Mott street. Before that
we lived at 200 Elm street.
   Jordan—What business were you in?
   Witness—I was in the smoking line.
   Jordan—What did you smoke?
   Witness—Meat, and fish sometimes.
   Jordan—Were you at home pretty constantly?
   Witness—I was at home pretty much in the day, and
always of a night. I used to go to fires though, some-
times.
   Jordan—Did you know, in May or June 1839, there was
such a woman as Madame Restell?
   Witness—No sir.
   Jordan—Was your wife in the habit of being absent
from home?
   Witness—Oh! she was in the habit of going round for
shopping if she wanted any thing. She was not in the
habit of running about, if that's what you mean. She
went once to the dress maker's, and once to the Bowery
to buy a dress. If she wanted to go out she went out like
other women.
   Jordan—Do you know if she ever went out at all?
   Witness—Well, I know she went to 200 Bowery.
   Jordan—<i>How</i> do you know?
   Witness—Because I went after her, and paid for the
dress she bought.
   Jordan—Do you know she did not go somewhere else,
now?
   Witness—Why, sir, she went and came back, and I
went to the Bowery, and I guess that's enough, for my
sister said—
   Jordan—Stop, sir, or I shall ask the Court to order you
into custody. For, your honor, I intend to treat this wit-
ness fairly, but at the same time I stand here, knowing
what I'm about, and if the gentlemen on the other side—
   Recorder—Now, Mr. Purdy, listen to the counsel, and
respond to his question, and nothing more.
   Here the District Attorney got up and charged Jordan
with abusing the witness, and Jordan replied, that if the
witness would let his tongue run with the rapidity of a
mill tail, it was the duty of counsel to stop him. He felt
as good natured as the District Attorney, and wanted to
go on.
   Recorder—There, go on, gentlemen; attend to the
question, Mr. Purdy.
   Jordan—Now, Mr. Purdy, you did not go with your
wife to the Bowery, I suppose, after all?
   Witness—No, sir.
   Jordan—Did you go out with her at any other time?
   Witness—Yes, sometimes.
   Jordan—Did she ever go out without you?
   Witness—Yes, sometimes.
   Jordan—Had she company when she went out?
   Witness—Well, I believe she went alone.
   Jordan—Did she ever go out with company to your
knowledge?
   Witness—Once she did, when I could not go; she went
with a young man of my acquaintance, of the name of
Mowbray.
   Jordan—What was he?
   Witness—A painter.
   Jordan—Oh! then we have it at last. Young painter
Mowbray went out with her!
   Witness—Yes, they went for a walk on a fourth of
July night, and came back again in a short time.
   Jordan—Did any body else go with them on that night?
   Witness—Yes, I think Mowbray took his lady; her
whom he since married.
   Jordan—Did you, sir, see the lady and Mowbray with
your wife at all<u>.</u>
   Witness—No, sir, but I saw Mowbray, and the servant
girl said—
   Recorder—Never mind the girl now.
   Jordan—Where is this Mr. Mowbray now, sir<u>.</u>
   Witness—I don't know.
   Jordan—How long is it since you saw him?
   Witness—One day last week, I think.
   Jordan—Have you ever been in the employ of the Har-
lem Railroad Company?
   Witness—Yes, for two years<u>?</u>
   Jordan—When did you quit?
   Witness—Why, I get paid up to—
   Jordan—I don't want to know when you get paid up to,
sir.
   Witness—Well, will you tell me this, sir.
   Jordan—No, sir, I'm not under an examination, and
won't tell anything.
   Witness—Then, Sir, I was paid up to the first of May,
but I left off going on the cars some time before that.
   Jordan—Well, it's a mighty small thing to tell, I should
say.
   Witness—Then I can't tell.
   Jordan—Oh, I understand you, sir. Now sir, you must
tell me when you quitted working for the Rail company.
   Witness—I can't tell. It might be in March or April,
but I got paid up to the first of May.
   Jordan—Were you engaged by the month or year?
   Witness—By the month.
   Jordan—Why did they pay you up to the first of May, if
you were engaged by the month?
   Witness—Well, you must ask Mr. Wigham. I suppose
they kept me as an extra hand.
   Jordan—That's all, I believe. Oh no, I want to ask
another question: have you ever been in Pennsylvania
for the last year or two?
   Witness—I've been in New Jersey.
   Jordan—Ah! I didn't say anything about New Jersey,
I said Pennsylvania.
   Witness—Well, where is Pennsylvania?
   Jordan—Well, it's not in New Jersey.
   Witness—Well then, I never was there; I've been to
Newark and up the North River, and about Orange co.
   Jordan—Had your wife ever been to Pennsylvania<u>.</u>
   Witness—She went to Philadelphia once.
   District Attorney—Purdy, how do you know your wife
went to Philadelphia?
   Witness—Oh, Mr. Black said, and the Doctor said she
must go somewhere.
   Jordan—We don't want to know what Mr. Black or
Mr. White said.
   District Attorney—Well, he only knew that she went
away unwell.
   Witness—That's all, sir.
   District Attorney—Had she generally good health?
   Witness—Yes, previous to her premature delivery.
   Jordan—What time did she go to Philadelphia?
   Witness—Why, last summer.
   Jordan—In 1839 were you the owner of a gold watch?
   Witness—Yes.
   Jordan—And chain?
   Witness—My wife had one, and other trinkets.
   Jordan—How long had she been the owner of those
articles?
<d>[Col.4]</d>
   Witness—Why, she had them when I married her. The
chain I bought last summer.
   Jordan—Did you know of her pawning them?
   Witness—No, sir.
   Jordan—What has become of the watch?
   Witness—It is eat up, I believe.
   Jordan—Now, be careful, or you let out something.
   Witness—Well, if I let out anything, you'll catch it up,
won't you?
   Jordan—Exactly so, my friend—<u title="you're">your</u> getting sharp.
   Witness—Well, then, I've not seen it since it came from
Mrs. Restell.
   Jordan—When did you see the rings?
   Witness—I saw some of them this morning.
   Jordan—Now, you've said something about the pawn-
ing business. Do you know of your own knowledge that
the watch was pawned?
   Witness—Well, I <u>dont</u> know how you want to get round
it. I saw what satisfied me, that—
   Jordan—I <u>dont</u> want what satisfied you.
   Witness—Well, then, I didn't know.
   Jordan—Was your wife a lady of property when you
married?
   Witness.—No: she tended store at a confectioner's in
Pearl street.
   Jordan—Are you a married man now, sir?
   Witness—No, I'm not.
   Jordan—Did you live with a woman, or are you in the
habit of sleeping with one, at this time, sir?
   Dist. Att.—He is not bound to answer.
   Rec.—I doubt the pertinency of the question, gentle-
men.
   Witness.—Well, I shall not answer that, at all.
   Jordan.—How large a woman was your wife?
   Witness.—She was not so tall as me by a head and a
half.
   [The witness himself is considerably under the mid-
dle size.]
   Jordan.—That's all, sir.
   Henry W. Merritt called and sworn.—I am one of the
magistrates of the city. I was called upon to take the
examination of Mrs. Purdy. The papers I hold are depo-
sitions taken before me on the 24th of March last, and a
subsequent one on the 22d. They were taken in the
presence of Madame Restell.
   Jordan.—Now, sir, we propose to object.
   Dist. Att.—I only want the preliminary question now,
if the Court please.
   <u>Jordon</u>.—Well, if you reserve our rights, I've no ob-
jections.
   Recorder.—O, of course sir.
   Merritt.—It was taken in her presence, and I told her
she might have counsel. She said Mr. <u>Morrell</u> would be
there, and she would go with me. Mrs. Purdy was con-
fined to her bed, at the corner of Broome and the Bowe-
ry. She was told that she might cross-examine the wit-
ness, and she did put a number of questions to her.
   Dist. Att.—Did Mrs. Purdy answer the questions, and
were they put in the affidavit?
   Merritt.—They were not; I didn't think—
   Jordan.—Well, sir, why not?
   Merritt.—Why, now I remember, it was but one ques-
tion, which she repeated several times.
   Jordan.—Well, sir, I want to know if Justice Merritt
has a right to determine what he will put down? for if
so, the Lord preserve me from Justice Merritt!
   Merritt—Stay till your time comes.
   Recorder—It will become a question by and by, Mr.
Jordan, if the question ought to be put down.
   Jordan—Did you put down the question she put to the
woman?
   Merritt—Not from her mouth; it had been put down
before.
   Jordan—Well, it could be put by no other mouth. She
had no counsel.
   Merritt—Well, it was not.
   Jordan—Did she send out for counsel, to your know-
ledge, sir?
   Merritt—No.
   Jordan—Was it stated that the sole object was to get
her identified?
   Merritt—I <u>dont</u> know that it was so stated, but that
was the object.
   Jordan—Was she told what the object was?
   Merritt—I presume she did know. I've no doubt I told
her so, indeed.
   <u>Morrell</u>—How long after her arrest was it before she
was carried to the Bowery?
   Merritt—Why, she was not carried at all.
   <u>Morrell</u>—Well, before you went there? Was it half an
hour?
   Merritt—I think not.
   <u>Morrell</u>—Was it twenty minutes?
   Merritt—I <u>dont</u> know anything about minutes.
   <u>Morrell</u>—Well, did you not say that it was only for
identification, and that she would not want counsel?
   District Attorney—We propose to read the paper,
now, sir.
   Jordan—Well, we object to it, sir; and I think we are
entitled to the warrant before we go into the argument.
   Recorder—Well, gentlemen, we will leave off now,
and hear the argument to-morrow. Adjourn Court, Mr.
Hays.

   T<small>URNING THE</small> T<small>ABLE</small>.—On Tuesday, two men, named
Willard and Wood, were arrested on a bench warrant,
which charged one of them with obtaining a large quan-
tity of property, under false pretences. They were
brought into Court of Sessions, where Wood gave
bail, but, on going out, he was again arrested by the or-
ders of Justice Parker, and a large sum of money taken
from him. Willard and Wood were then taken before
Chief Justice Jones, at his chambers in the City Hall,
yesterday morning, and both again liberated. A civil
writ was then got out against Justice Parker and four of
the police officers, and all of them held to bail. How this
matter will terminate, remains to be seen.
   T<small>HAT</small> S<small>ILVER</small> P<small>ITCHER</small>.—Yesterday afternoon, his honor
the Mayor, surrounded by the whole corps of indefatiga-
bles, presented that silver pitcher to the venerable High
Constable, Jacob Hays. His honor made a brief but
touching speech to “the old boy in specs,” and remarked
that he felt a high satisfaction in being made the instru-
ment through whose hands the compliment was to pass,
inasmuch as whilst he, the Mayor, had been connected
with the criminal jurisprudence of the city, he had met
with various instances of corruption and malfeasance on
the part of the police officers, but that not a whisper or a
suspicion of any kind, had ever been cast upon the fair
fame of Jacob Hays.
   The High Constable having received the pitcher, took
a piece of manuscript from his pocket, and read his reply
to the Mayor's speech; thanking his Honor and his staff
officers for the honor conferred on himself. After which
<u title="the">tho</u> corps of indefatigables bade the Mayor good day, and
all went to take a drink.

  COURT OF GENERAL SESSIONS—Tuesday.
   <i>Before the Recorder, Judges Lynch and Noah, and
Aldermen Balis and Woodhull.</i>
   <u>Madam</u> Restell, alias Ann alias Caroline Lohman,
was placed at the bar, charged with a misdemeanor,
in producing abortion upon Mrs. Ann Maria Purdy,
living at the corner of the Bowery and Broome street,
on the 2nd day of June, 1839. Some length of time
was taken up in the <u title="empanelling">empannelling</u> a jury, as the
greater portion of our citizens already made up
their minds as to the guilt of the prisoner. After the
Jurors was sworn in, C. B. Laforge, Esq. as counsel
for Mr. Purdy, husband of the deceased, opened the case
to the jury, and stated that the indictment contained
two counts, one of which was, that the accuses admin-
istered to Mrs. Purdy certain Drugs, for the purpose
of producing abortion, the other was that the accused
had used a certain instrument to consummate the
same. Mrs. Purdy died at Newark, N. J., on the
28th of April last, and the present indictment against
the prisoner was founded on the above charges, in
producing the death of Mrs. Purdy.
   The principal witnesses sworn were the husband of
Mrs. Purdy and Justice Merritt, who took her exami-
nation while in a dying state, which set forth that the
accused had administered the drugs, and used the in-
strument in question. The two different examina-
tions were taken by Justice Merritt, in the presence
of the accused and Mrs. Purdy.
   Mr. Whiting, the District Attorney, proposed to
read the affidavit of Mrs. Purdy, taken before her
death, which was objected to by the counsel for the
accused, as illegal, and they were reserved for argu-
ment until Thursday, 11 o'clock, A. M. to which time
the Court adjourned.

<b>The Court of Sessions, and our Police and
		Criminal System.</b>
   We particularly ask the Grand Jury, now in ses-
sion, to take up the whole system of our Criminal,
Police and Sessions Courts, review all the errors,
follies, vices and corruptions growing out of the
same, and present the whole as a nuisance to the
city. The whole system is wrong, and it is high
time it should be reformed.
   In the police office we have six or seven magis-
trates, (remember that, tax-payers!) heaven knows
how many officers—some forty or fifty; one hundred
marshals, all or nearly all continually presenting hea-
vy bills to the Board of Supervisors—and yet not a man
employed as a preventive police. Indeed, said the Dis-
trict Attorney, if the police officers, &c., put a stop
to stealing and stool-pigeons, under the present sys-
tem, they will starve.
   Let the Grand Jury look at the case of our police
officers disgraced and dismissed; let them look at
the high-handed measures of Justice Parker, for
which he was arrested himself; look at Justice
Wiley's case; look at the Boston robbers and high
constable Clapp, convicted of compounding and con-
federating with a villain; look at one of our police
magistrates, tried, and only not broken because of a
change in the Common Council; look at the sloven-
ly mode of managing our criminal business; look at
the disgraceful anomaly of <i>five Judges</i>, at an average
of four or five dollars a day, each sitting on the Sessions
bench, all to try perhaps a petty larceny thief for
stealing a few pounds of pork—the Aldermen not re-
cognizing their two associate Judges, and the latter
not recognizing the Aldermen; each at one time
prepared—as in the case of Ferris, Lynch and Nash
—to commit each other to jail for contempt, and
wrangling for a chair on the bench of a criminal
court.
	...
   Look at Noah; sometimes he looks as if he was
half asleep for half a day; and then, while his as-
sociate is charging the jury in relation to himself, he
is actually scribbling scurrilous paragraphs for the
“Star,” abusing his brother editors, and even the
Aldermen sitting on the same bench with him. How
very dignified is such conduct in a judge. Can such
a judge be brought into contempt, especially when
we add to it his mountebank tricks on Grand Island,
dressing himself in the soiled garments of the Park
Theatre wardrobe (the Lord Mayor's dress in
Richard the Third) and going ashore, as Ald. Banks
the bookseller, describes him, arm-in-arm with Red
Jacket, singing “Hi Betty Martin,” to take posses-
sion of Grand Island. Then again remember his
trial in the very court over which he now presides,
for breaking the seal of another man's letter. Who
can respect such a judge?
   We ask the grand jury whether such a court can
be brought into contempt? We ask them to re-
member the recent charge of Judge Lynch, in re-
lation to himself and Noah. Governor Seward,
when he removed Recorder Morris, assigned, as the
principal reason for so doing, that Morris charged
the grand jury in relation to himself, thereby pre-
judging his own case. For this, Morris was vio-
lently removed. At that time, Lynch rose, and in
the most coarse and violent manner, told the grand
jury he never heard such an outrageous thing as the
Recorder's charging the jury in reference to himself.
And yet, in the face of all this, he charges the jury to
indict a paper that dared to say what it thought of
him, viz: that he is a very poor lawyer.
   In his recent charge to the grand jury, he told
them they must not hear evidence at all in relation to
a defendant, because it was, he said, contrary to
law. In this, he said what was false. Recorder
Tallmadge says that the contrary is the law of the
land; and he gave a charge to the jury, last term, en-
tirely contrary to Lynch's; and therefore Lynch is
either ignorant of the law, or, knowing it, he wil-
fully told a falsehood from the bench to a grand jury.
Take which horn of the dilemma he pleases, in either
case he is unfit to be a judge. If the grand jury have
any doubts about it, we ask them to look at the re-
cords of the Court of Chancery. If then, they believe
him capable, we ask them to summon the Sessions'
clerk to produce the records of the various criminals
Lynch has let out on bail; not forgetting Butcher
Joe, whom it cost $300 to catch again, and who is
now in the State prison.
   In many cases of felony, in which the Police Ma-
gistrates have refused to liberate on bail notorious,
bad characters, the friends of the felons have taken
them before a convenient legal functionary, termed
“a Supreme Court Commissioner,” by which <i>ruse</i>
the ends of justice have in many cases been defeated.
These occurrences have induced us to refer to the
records in the office of the Clerk of the Sessions, for
the names of the persons bailed, and the Judge who
has been liberal in this mode of dispensing justice to
the people.
   The Clerk of the Sessions has no record which dis-
tinguishes the names of persons admitted to bail by
Judge Lynch, on writs of Habeas Corpus, prior to
the April term. On referring to his record, kept du-
ring the months of April, May and June, we find
that the following persons, all charged with felony,
have been liberated on bail, by this high legal func-
tionary, at his office, sitting as a Supreme Court
Commissioner:—
<table style="white-space:normal;font-size:90%;line-height:90%;">
<tr><td>Michael Driscoll—no recognizance.</td> <td align=right> </td></tr>
<tr><td>Jeremiah Freeman, bailed in the sum of</td> <td align=right>$100</td></tr>

<tr><td>Joseph Morrison alias Butcher Joe—this fellow<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   fled, his bail was estreated, and the surety ap-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   plied to the Recorder for relief. The Recor-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   der declined to interfere, a reward of $300 was<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

   the Police Justice refused to take bail. A ha-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   beas corpus was got, and Kennedy carried be-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   fore Judge Lynch, who took one Robert Ste-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   venson, a man of straw, who hangs about the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Tombs, as surety for Kennedy in the sum of<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

   There are doubtless a number of other cases
which we shall hunt up in a few days. In the mean
time we ask the Grand Jury to do Judge Lynch
justice; because we shall.

			<b>General Sessions.</b>
Present, the Recorder, Judge Noah and two Aldermen.
  J<small>ULY</small> 15—<i>Madame Restell's Case</i>.—The fair accused, with
her two learned counsel, took their seats at 11 o'clock,
and the bench being full shortly after, the jury was called
over by the Clerk.
   Mr. <u>Morrell</u> said the first paper he offered to the atten-
tion of the court was as follows:—
<span style="border:dotted .4em;display:inline-block;padding:.2em">   The Keeper of the City <u title="Prison">Pprison</u>, <u title="&o. ?">&c.</u> &c. will secure
and safely keep for examination, the body of
		ANN LOHMAN alias RESTELL.
   (Felony.)				March 22, 1841.
	New York Police Office.
					H. W. MERRITT.
   Officer, G. Hays.	(No. 145.)</span>
   The next was the commitment of Madame Restell to
the custody of the keeper for a felony.
   The next was a notification from John A. Morrill, of
counsel for the accused, to Hyde, the keeper of the pri-
son, warning that officer against the consequences of per-
mitting her to be illegally taken from the prison for any
purpose.
   The next was her protest against the legality of the ex-
amination, and also against her being present thereat
against her wishes and consent. This document was ad-
dressed to the Recorder, Tallmadge.
   William C. Betts called, and examined by Mr. Morrill—
I was a clerk in the office of John A. Morrill in March,
1841. Remember an application to act as counsel for
Madame Restell. I went with the applicant, but could
not find Mr. M. The applicant said Mr. Morrill must come
to the police office, or the Sessions directly, or it would
be too late. It was between 3 and 5 in the afternoon, and
I found Mr. Morrill and went in half an hour.
   John A. Morrill called, and examined by Mr. Jordan—
The moment my clerk had told me that I was wanted to
act as counsel for Madame Restell I proceeded to the po-
lice office, and saw the lady either immediately or in
a few minutes afterwards. I think it was just before she
returned from Mrs. Purdy's.
   The District Attorney objected to any thing that might
have been said after the return from Mrs. Purdy's.
   His Hon. the Recorder held that the question was inad-
missible in relation to the subsequent conversation with
Mr. Morrill.
   Mr. Jordan contended the examination was in violation
of the Statute, and that the whole was a farce from be-
ginning to end, she being deceived from beginning to
end.
   The deposition being <u title="= already">all ready</u> drawn, and the only
question put to deponent being “is it all true as here
stated.”
   Recorder—The District Attorney now offers to read
the deposition taken before Justice Merritt.
   District Attorney—Yes, sir.
   Jordan—No, sir, I deny it to be a deposition taken be-
fore Justice Merritt. It is only a paper purporting to be
in “the Sessions” where Justice Merritt has no jurisdic-
tion.
   Recorder—Gentlemen, I'll call it <i>a paper</i>.
   District Attorney—We call it a deposition, your honor.
   Jordan—Your honor's right it is only <i>a paper</i>, and I'm
particular about it, because the course taken yesterday
was calculated to entrap us.
   Recorder—Let Mr. Morrill proceed.
	...
   Mr. Morrill then cited a case tried in North Carolina on
a charge of a rape, where the deposition of the girl had
been ruled out on the trial, she having died shortly af-
ter making it. Mr. Morrill cited some other cases, and
sat down.
   Mr. Jordan said he intended to take stronger ground,
and show that no preliminary enquiry or deposition
made could be given in evidence if the party making it
was dead.
   Mr. La Forge and the District Attorney were heard on

concluded when the court rose and adjourned.

   C<small>OURT OF</small> S<small>ESSIONS</small>, July 15.—Before the Recorder, Judges
Lynch and Noah, and Aldermen Balis and Woodhull.
   The trial of Madame Restell was resumed.
   Mr. Morrill, for defence, read the original commitment, by
Justice Merritt, of the accused on the 22d March, for a <i>felony</i>,
for examination; also a full commitment for the accused for a
<i>misdemeanor</i> on the 1st April; also an order of Court for con-
ducting of the accused from the prison to the residence of Mrs.
Purdy, to be present at the examination of Mrs. Purdy, or for
identification; also the protest of Mr. Morrill, one of her coun-
sel, against the taking of the accused to the residence of Mrs.
Purdy.
   It was proved by W. C. Betts, clerk of Mr. Morrill, that Mr.
Lohman called at the office of Morrill to return the latter as
counsel; and witness went and found Mr. Morrill, who proceed-
ed to the Police Office to see Mrs. Restell in half an hour after
Mr. Lohman had called at his office. Mr. Morrill corroborated
the statement of his clerk.
	...
   Mr. Whiting, the District Attorney, followed on the same
side, in an able and erudite argument, tending to show that the
depositions were legally taken, and must by law and precedent
be admitted as evidence. Mr. Jordan concluded the argument
against the legal right to admit the affidavits, in an able and lu-
cid speech, and adduced, as evidence of the rightfulness of his
positions, numerous authorities.
   The Court will decide the question relative to the admissi-
bility of these depositions this day at 11 o'clock.

			<b>General Sessions.</b>
Present—The Recorder, Judges Noah and Lynch, and
			one Alderman.
   <i>Madame Restell's Case</i>.—His Honor the Recorder said
that in this case the jury could be liberated until Mon-
day, as it would certainly take the Court until that time
to make up their opinion on the question of law, involv-
ing a very important principle, which had been submit-
ted to them.
   <i>Sentences</i>.—Ann Foster, a well dressed, middle aged,
lady like woman, convicted of forgery in the third de-
gree, passing bills purporting to be $20 bills which had
been altered from twos, was put to the bar. The Record-
er, in passing sentence, said that it was one of the illus-
trations of the cunning and adroitness of counterfeiters
in the employing of a respectable looking woman, like
the prisoner, and it was known to the Court that the pris-
oner had been so employed for a series of years. Her
crimes were not limited to this transaction—giving false
relations when asked where she had resided, and the ob-
jects she had in view; and it is the regret of the Court
that the prisoner did not inform the public authorities of
her employers, for then, instead of the heavy punishment
falling on the weaker vessel, it would have fallen on the
real offenders.
   The judgement of the Court was, that Ann Foster be
imprisoned in the state prison for five years.
   ...
   Peter E. <u>Bertram</u>, a small, innocent looking boy, tried
for burglary and convicted of a petty larceny, was sent
to dig stone for six months.
   Mary Layton, convicted of keeping a disorderly house,
was adjudged to sit on the stool of repentance on Black-
well's Island for sixty days.
   <u>Bernard</u> Gallagher, convicted of whipping a man, but
he, Gallagher, having a good character, was only mulct-
ed in the sum of five dollars.
   John Graves, for the like offence—nothing said about
John's character—was fined fifteen dollars.
	...
   John Small, “a very good young man,” who had
horsewhipped a very poor young woman in the presence
of Judge Noah, in a most unmerciful manner for not pay-
ing for a glass of liquor which she had drank, was next
paraded, lectured on the enormity of his offence, and
<i>fined fifteen dollars</i>.
	...
   <i>Justice Parker vs. Willard and Wood—Novel Application</i>.
Mr. W. M. Price and Mr. Russell applied to the Court, on
an affidavit from Willard for an order calling on Justice
Parker to show cause why he should not return to Wil-
lard or the assignee of Wood, a sum of money amounting
to $11,000, in notes of one of the banks of this city, a $200
due bill, a gold watch, diamond pin, and other property,
which had been taken from the person of Wood by two
Police Officers, in the presence of Justice Parker, and by
him retained or handed over to some third party. The
affidavit, which was very long, alleged a variety of very
extraordinary matters, and amongst other things, stated
that application had been made for the return of this pro-
perty, but that the Police Magistrate had stated that he
should continue to hold it, because he had the sanction of
this Court.
   At the reading of this part of the affidavit the Recorder
stated that there must be some mistake in it, for the Court
had had no consultation on the matter and given Justice
Parker no such direction.
	...
   His Honor, the Recorder, then discharged the Petty
Jury, with the exception of those sworn on the Restell
case, for the term, and adjourned until Monday.

			<b>Special Sessions.</b>
		Before Judge Noah and two Aldermen.
   J<small>ULY</small> 16.—John Smith and Dan Miller, negroes, for
stealing a brace of hams, were sent to dig stone for sixty
days.
	...
   John Dougherty, for whipping a man, was sent to the
Tombs, for 30 days.
   Mary Ann <u title="O'Kearden ?">O'Keardon</u>, for whipping a woman, was
sent to the Tombs for 30 days.
   William Mack, for violating Matilda Evans in a stable,
and not paying said Matilda, was sent to dig stone for 60
days.
   Some loafers were discharged, and the Court adjourn-
ed.

   M<small>ORE OF THE</small> W<small>ILLARD</small> C<small>ONTROVERSY</small>.—Justice Par-
ker was yesterday arrested on a capias from the Circuit
Court, on an action of damages for false imprisonment,
at the suit of Henry Willard. The damages, in this case,
are lade at $10,000, and Judge Edwards held Justice Par-
ker to bail in $1,000. This freak of Justice Parker's will
cut out plenty of work for the lawyers, that's certain.
We do not know if that will be of much satisfaction to the
magistrate or not.

================================================================
<d>[Col.3]</d>
   C<small>OURT OF</small> S<small>ESSIONS</small>, July 19.—Before the Recorder, Judges
Lynch and Noah, and Aldermen Balis and Woodhull.
   <i>Case of Madame Restell</i>.—At the opening of the Court
the Recorder delivered a long and learned Opinion, in
which both the other Judges concurred, of which the following
are the main points: The question presented is whether the de-
position of Mrs. Purdy taken on the 22d of March, 1841, upon
which a warrant was issued against the accused is admissible
in evidence on the trial of this cause. It is clear from the
statutes that a mere ex parte deposition taken without affording
the accused an opportunity of cross examining the witness, can-
not be read upon the trial. In the present case, however, it is in
proof that the deposition was read over to the deceased in presence
of the accused, and that she, being apprised of her rights,
was also offered the opportunity of cross examining the witness.
	...
the statement of the Justice that the question put had been re-
sponded to in the body of the deposition. The Court was
therefore clearly of opinion that the deposition was admissible.
   Gilbert F. Hays, sworn for defence, deposed that he arrested
<d>[Col.4]</d>
the accused at her house in Greenwich-street, in March, on the
warrant of Justice Merritt on this charge, and took her to the
Police Office, where her husband, Mr. Lohman, accompanied
her. The latter asked witness where he could procure counsel.
Witness told him, and he went for counsel. The accused was
left in the Police Office with witness, and in about five minutes
they proceeded to the house of Mrs. Purdy. Justice Merritt
asked her, before going, if she had any objection to go to the
house of Mrs. Purdy; she answered she had none. Did not
hear Justice Merritt say that the object in taking the accused to
Mors Purdy's house was for the purpose of having her identi-
fied. Justice Merritt told her she was entitled to counsel, and
witness told the Justice that Mr. Lohman had gone for counsel.
After reaching the house of Mrs. Purdy, Justice Merritt told
accused to pay attention to the reading of the affidavit, first ask-
ing Mrs. Purdy “if this was the woman.” Mrs. Purdy answered
“Yes.” The Justice then cautioned Mrs. Purdy, telling her
she was on her dying bed, and to be careful if she had made any
mistake. The affidavit was then read to Mrs. Purdy and sworn
to by her, in presence of accused.
   Cross-examined.—When witness arrested accused, she read
the warrant, and said her name was not Madame Restell. Wit-
ness told her she was the one he wanted. Nothing was then
said about counsel; at the house of Mrs. Purdy the accused
said nothing about counsel; she said something to Mrs. Purdy,
but witness cannot say what it was. The charge was stated to
accused by Justice Merritt at the Police Office.
   Henry W. Merritt, Esq. recalled—deposed that when ac-
cused was brought to the Police, he stated to her in substance
what the affidavit contained. Witness told her that Mrs. Purdy
was sick and confined to her bed, and it was necessary to go up
there. At the house, witness told accused he was about to read
the deposition of Mrs. Purdy, and suggested to her to pay at-
tention to it. It was read, and sworn to by Mrs. Purdy in pre-
sence of accused. After the affidavit was read and sworn to,
the second affidavit was taken of Mrs. Purdy, identifying ac-
cused. I told accused she might ask Mrs. Purdy questions.
   Cross examined—We were at Mrs. Purdy's house from half
to three quarters of an hour. When witness returned, Mr.
Morrill was at the Police Office—told him as soon as Counsel
were ready I would proceed to examine the accused under the
statute. Mr. Morrill did not express a wish to go back and cross
examine Mrs. Purdy.
   Direct resumed—Witness wished the Counsel, Mr. Morrill,
to fix a day for the examination of the accused, and the 24th
March was fixed. On that day Messrs. Jordan and Morrill at-
tended, and in the presence at the accused, witness asked them
if they wished a week to go and cross examine Mrs. Purdy;
they said nothing, declining to answer. Witness then told them
he would proceed to the examination of the accused, and did
so. Judge Lownds was present at the conversation.
   The District Attorney then proceeded to read the depositions
of Mrs. Purdy, some parts of which, viz: conversations with a
third party, (colored Rebecca,) were ruled out. The substance
of the affidavits having been fully published before, it is need-
less to repeat them here. They testify to the fact of the applica-
tion for and the receipt of drugs from the accused, the want of
effect and the subsequent manipular operations to produce the
effect, and the actual production of that effect, contrary to law,
with the resulting deleterious effects to the health of Mrs.
Purdy, the witness.
   Lucinda Van Buskirk sworn—Is a married woman; was ac-
quainted with Mrs. Purdy when alive; saw Madame Restell
once at her residence in Greenwich st.; went with Mrs. Purdy
there in July, 1839, after her miscarriage. Mrs. Purdy wanted
Madame Restell to give her the watch and chain and rings, &c.
which she had left there, without her husband's knowing it.
Madame Restell said she could not give them up until she gave
her the rest of the money, saying 'we have done it very low,
much lower than we are in the habit of doing it, and I have
given $5 of the $6 to the doctor.' She said 'if you had gone
your full time, it would have cost you a good deal more.' Mrs.
Purdy said, 'then I shall be obliged to tell my husband.' Ma-
dame Restell replied, 'Oh, you cannot do that, for it will be a
State Prison offence for you as well as for me.' She did not give
Mrs. Purdy the watch and other articles at that time, but asked
her the number of her boarding house, which Mrs. Purdy gave.
Madame R. Said she would send up for the money.
   Cross examined—Never saw Madame Restell but that time
and now; went to oblige Mrs. Purdy and to gratify an idle cu-
riosity in seeing Madame Restell, of whom she had heard much.
Never went there afterwards. Saw one lady there whom wit-
ness thought was a married woman, who came in and sat down,
and soon after two other women came in and sat down. Two
men also came in, but went away before witness did. Madame
Restell said they had often given her 40, 50, and sometimes as
much as $100, and she had done the thing for $20. Madame
Restell said she would come up to her boarding house and get
the money—she handed each of the ladies a circular to read,
which I have mislaid. Witness did not hear half the conversa-
tion between Mrs. Purdy and Madame Restell. A gentleman
purchased some medicine of accused and gave her $5 for it.
   After a recess of an hour and a half, the Court again assem-
bled at 5 1-2 o'clock.<a id="Tribune-1841-07-20-Dr-Marvin"></a>
   Dr. David D. Marvin testified that he was a physician, resi-
dent No. 80 Greene st., that he attended Mrs. Purdy from the
21st to 29th July, 1839. He found her laboring under severe
pains, and it was one or two days after he first saw her that her
child was born, and he was inclined to believe from her previous
good health and the suddenness of her delivery that it was pre-
mature.
   Cross examined by Counsel for Accused—He was first ac-
quainted with Mrs. P. in the spring of 1838. After her delivery
she recovered, but was more exposed to inclement weather
than is consistent with health, until her sickness prevented her
being out of doors. Mrs. P. was a woman of ordinary intellect,
of fickle disposition, not illiterate for her station, but easily in-
fluenced. She was in the habit of visiting her neighbors con-
siderably. Witness has seen deceased and one Mowbray to-
gether, both in the presence and absence of her husband. She
assigned, on the 21st, severe exertion in washing, as the cause
of her premature delivery, and repeated this once or twice af-
terward within the two days succeeding. He remembers her
once making affidavit with reference to a certain pawn ticket,
and he went with her to a pawn-broker's either in Chatham
square or in Division st. with the affidavit and got a watch, brass
chain and some rings, which she had pawned. [The counsel
were here called upon by the Court to produce the affidavit,
but were unable. The counsel for accused wished to convict
Mrs. P. by it of having sworn falsely.] The watch was given
to witness for safe keeping, because she was afraid of losing it:
it was destroyed by accidentally coming in contact with quick-
silver. The rest of the jewelry entrusted to witness was re-
turned to Mrs. Purdy. Witness has no knowledge of Mr.
Purdy's having been out of the State for the last three years.
Witness does not know that Mrs. Purdy ever went to Madame
Restell's with the watch. Neither witness nor his lady ever
accompanied Mrs. P. to Madame Restell's. The deceased was
able to be about until the winter of 1840. Her complaint then
was pulmonary consumption.
   Here the prosecution rested.
   The defence was commenced, and Mr. Morrill offered ad
evidence the examination of Madame Restell held March 24th,
1841, but it ruled out by the Court.
   Barrow A. Cohen was sworn. Witness attends the pawn-
broker's store of Mr. Levy, No. 5 Division-st., and did in 1839.
Does not recollect Mrs. Purdy or Dr. Marvin. He has an affi-
davit made by the former. [He here gave it, with a paper at-
tached, to counsel for the accused. Mr. Morrill read the pa-
pers. They were a list of articles pledged, as the paper says
Feb. 12, 1839, and an affidavit, signed by Emeline Purdy,
swearing that the pawn ticked for those articles had been lost.
The goods pledge were a watch, pencil case, and two rings,
worth $16.] Witness does not know the handwriting, and does
not recollect positively the articles he gave up at the time of re-
ceiving the affidavit.
   W. W. Purdy testified that he never called at Mad. Restell's
for the goods. He now lives at Harlem, where he keeps a ho-
tel, and has been married since his last examination. Witness
never wrote or caused to be written a letter to Mad. Restell,
nor has he ever called on her to pay money, nor has he ever
said to any one that he would compromise this matter for any
sum of money. Witness has been to newspaper offices to state
that he had been discharged by the Railroad Company because
he had had Mad. Restell arrested; John S. Wigham told him
so. He had been on the car on which he was employed for
some days, and called upon Mr. Wigham, who told him the
President of the Company had said that, as the Restell affair
had made so much noise, and as witness had 'run low' for a
month or tow, (i. e. his receipts were less than before,) they
could not have him any longer. Immediately after this he sta-
ted the fact at a number of the newspaper offices. The Presi-
dent of the Company then requested him to stop the publication
of it, which he did. The reason of his not having collected as
much as others was his wife's illness, which made it necessary
that another man should run his car for him. The President
never intimated that he had appropriated any part of the money
to his own use.
   Dr. Marvin recalled.—Stated that he believed the Commis-
sioner wrote the affidavit presented, which is the one that Mrs.
Purdy carried to the pawn-brokers in company with witness.
   The testimony was here concluded, and on application of the
counsel for the accused, the Court was adjourned to 11 o'clock
this morning, when the summing up will commence.

			<b>General Sessions.</b>
Present—The Recorder, Judges Noah and Lynch, and
			two Aldermen.
   J<small>ULY</small> 19—<i>Madame Restell's Case</i>.—The fair accused
came into Court at 11 o'clock and took her seat at the
table by the side of her counsel.
   The Recorder delivered the following decision as the
opinion of the Court, none of the bench dissenting:—
   <i>The People vs. Restell, alias Lohman</i>.—The prosecution
in support of the indictment, offers to read the deposition
of Ann Maria Purdy, taken before Justice Merritt, a Po-
lice Magistrate, on the 22d March, 1841, upon which a
warrant was issued against the accused.
	...
   Purdy, late husband of the deponent, testified to the
death of Mrs. Purdy on the 28th day of April last.
   It was also proved, on the part of the accused, that the
Magistrate omitted to insert in the deposition, or to an-
nex to it, certain questions put by the accused to Mrs.
Purdy, and her answers to those questions, he alleging
that he did not deem them material, and that they had
been substantially answered in the deposition previously
taken.
   The question that is presented by the argument is: Is
this deposition thus taken, admissible in evidence on the
trial of this cause?
	...
   I am therefore clearly of opinion that the deposition is
admissible.
   Some little dispute then took place between the Dis-
trict Attorney and Mr. Jordan as to the right of the pro-
secutor to re-examine Justice Merritt, but owing to the
noise in the court, it was impossible for the reporters to
hear what was said.
   Mr. M. said that before the deposition was gone into
they had a witness to examine.
   Gilbert Hays, examined—I arrested Madame Restell at
her house in Greenwich street some time in March, on the
charge contained in this warrant. Her husband asked me
where he could get counsel. I told him there was plen-
ty of counsel. She was by. Her husband then left.—
Justice Merritt was in the office, but I cannot recollect if
he was close enough to have heard it. In a few mo-
ments after Lohman started, we left with the prisoner
for Mrs. Purdy's. I should say it was about five minutes.
Justice Merritt asked her if she had any objections to go
up and see Mrs. Purdy. She, Restell, said “No.” I don't
know that any thing was said in relation to identity.
   Jordan—Did he say what the object was?
   Hays—I didn't hear him say what the object was, but I
considered it was for identity.
   Jordan—Did <u title="Callender">Calender</u> or Merritt say if she was not the
woman she would be discharged?
   Hays—I didn't hear it.
<d>[Col.6]</d>
   Jordan—Did he tell her she had a right to counsel?
   Witness—I believe he did, but I heard nothing about
counsel after her husband went away. I told the Justice
she had sent for counsel. We were at Mrs. Purdy's on
that occasion from twenty minutes to half an hour. Di-
rectly we got there Justice Merritt proceeded with the
business he went on. He told Mrs. Restell to pay atten-
tion, as he was going to read over an affidavit to her. He
asked Mrs. Purdy first, if “this was the woman?” She
said “yes,” and then said to Mrs. R. “to pay attention,”
&c. He then cautioned her to be very careful, and if she
had made any mistake to have it rectified. He then pro-
ceeded to read it. I do not know if another affidavit was
taken. <u title="Callender">Calender</u> was there, and used pen and ink.
   <u>Jordon</u>—I now understand you to say I've related sub-
stantially all that took place, although I do not remember
every word that was said. Is that so?
   Hays—Yes. I showed her the warrant when I arrested
her. She read it and she said she was not Madame Restell.
I said she was the person we wanted. She said she did
not know Mrs. Purdy.
   Whiting—Did you find her husband at her house<u>.</u>
   Hays—Yes; and he read the warrant. Nothing was
said about counsel until we got to the police office.
	...
   H. W. Merritt re-called by the District Attorney—
When Mrs. Restell was brought to the office I told her
that Mrs. Purdy was sick.
   Whiting—Tell us what you said to her.
   Merritt—I didn't read the affidavit, but I told her in
substance what the charge was, and what the affidavit
contained. I told her that Mrs. Purdy was confined to
her bed.
   Here the District Attorney proposed to re-examine the
Justice as to talk about identity, and if anything was
said, which proposal called up Mr. <u>Jordon</u>, who deliver-
ed one of his aquafortis <u title="philippics">phillipics</u> against the way in
which things were managed by the Police Justices.
	...
   Merritt—I told her up to Mrs. Purdy's that I was about
to read the examination of Mrs. Purdy, and she must pay
attention to it. The examination was then read and
sworn to by Mrs. Purdy. I told her she could put any
question she thought proper. Mrs. Purdy was examined
as to the identity.
	...
   Morrill—Did you state the charge?
   Merritt—Well, I said she was charged with producing
abortion.
   Morrill—Did you not find me waiting at your office
when you came back?
   Merritt—Yes, I believe I did.
   Morrill—Did you not state that she had been taken
merely for identity?
   Merritt—Something of the kind.
   Morrill—Did I not say you proceeded on a very extra-
ordinary errand?
   Merritt—Something of that sort.
   John. B. LaForge, sworn—Mr. Jordan objected to the
testimony about to be given by this witness.
   The Recorder and Judge Noah sustained the objection,
but Lynch wanted it gone into.
   Merritt was then re-called, for the purpose of showing
that at a subsequent period an offer was made of liberty
to cross-examine Mrs. Purdy.
   To this Jordan objected. The court overruled and the
counsel excepted.
   Merritt—The 24th of March I fixed for the examina-
tion of Mrs. Restell, and <u>Morrell</u> and Jordan both came.
I asked the counsel if they wished the witnesses on the
part of the prosecution to be produced.
   <u>Jordon</u>—What did they say, sir?
   Merritt—They did not say any thing, sir. I then pro-
ceeded to take the examination.
   <u>Jordon</u>—Did not you and us go into the private room,
and talk it over?
   Merritt—Very likely we did.
   <u>Jordon</u>—Had you not told us, that you had made up
your mind as to the amount of bail, and did you not say
that you had made up your mind to commit her?
   Merritt—Very likely I did, for I made up my mind when
I issued the warrant as to committing her. I don't know
as to the bail.
   (Here Mrs. Purdy's deposition was read under objec-
tions and exceptions. As this has all been published
over and over again, it would be futile to repeat it.)
   Lucinda Van Buskirk examined—I'm a married wo-
man, and knew Mrs. Purdy. Have seen Madame Restell
once, saw her at the office in Greenwich street. I think
the same person is in Court. I went to her office in
Greenwich street about two years ago last July. We
went about the things. Mrs. Purdy wanted to get the
things without Mr. Purdy knowing they had been there.
I mean the watch and chain and some rings. Mrs. Res-
tell said she could not give them back, because she had
given the money to the Doctor, who had done it very
low. She said she had been sick and obliged to have a
doctor, and Madame Restell said, “Oh, it would have
cost you a great deal more, if you had gone your full
time.” Mrs. Purdy said “she must have them back, for
otherwise she must tell her husband.” To this Madame
replied, “Oh! you musn't do that, or it would be a State
Prison for me, as well as for you.”
   <u>Jordon</u>—How came you to go down with Mrs. Purdy?
   Witness—Why, I'd heard a great deal of Madame Res-
tell, and was very anxious to see her. I had two reasons
for going—one was idle curiosity, and the other a desire
to oblige Mrs. Purdy.
   <u>Jordon</u>—Was there any body else there?
   Witness—Yes, a lady who was a married lady. I'm sure
of that. Then two other ladies came in. Two gentle-
men also came in, but they went off again, and left all the
ladies behind. They then talked about the watch chain
and other things, and Madame Restell stated that she
could not give them back without the rest of the money,
which I think was $20. She said also that it had been
done very low, as they frequently had $100, and the $5
she paid had been given to the doctor.
   District Attorney—Did the ladies buy any of the medi-
cines?
   Witness—No, but the gentlemen did, and paid five dol-
lars for it, too.
   <u>Jordon</u>—Oh, the gentlemen were in trouble then?
   Witness—No, but they had ladies in trouble, I dare say.
   <i id="Herald-1841-07-20-Grand-Jury">Grand Jury</i>.—On motion of the District Attorney, two
more members were added to the Grand Inquest. About
two hours after, the Grand Jury came into Court with a
number of bills of indictment, among which it was un-
derstood were three charging James Gordon Bennett
with libelling the judicial characters of James Lynch
and M. M. Noah.
   The Grand Jury asked to be discharged, but the Re-
corder refused to comply, because the business before
them was incomplete, many witnesses being yet to be
examined. The Jury then left the Court.
   Their Honors adjourned at half past three.

	GENERAL SESSIONS—Yesterday.
   <i>Trial of <u>Madam</u> Restell, resumed</i>.—At the opening
of the Court the Recorder proceeded to read the deci-
sion of the Court, which was that the deposition of
Mrs. Purdy should be admissible as evidence on trial
of the accused. The first witness sworn was Gilbert
F. Hays, who deposed that he arrested the accused
	...
   Lucinda Van Buskirk, deposed that she went with
Mrs. Purdy to Mad. Restell's, for the purpose of get-
ting the watch and chain she had pledged for the
payment of her bill, the accused refused to give them
up as she had performed the operation at a low price.
Mrs. Purdy said she would tell her husband. Mrs.
Restell said it would not do, as it would be a State
Prison affair for both of them. A number of males
and females were there for advice.
   Mrs. Restell finally said she would take $35, but
would not give up the trinkets, as she had paid the
Dr. $5.
   Nothing was elicited on the cross examination of
this witness which went to prove either the innocence
or guilt of the accused.
   The Court then took a recess until 5½ P. M. The
proceedings after that time we are compelled to defer
until to-morrow.

Lynch and Noah, and Alderman Balis.
   <i>Madame Restell's Trial, continued</i>.—Huron Betts, sworn for
defence, deposed that he knew W. W. Purdy; that he request-
ed witness two or three weeks ago to go to Madame Restell and
ask her if she would give him so much money to keep his wit-
nesses away from Court. He did not name any particular sum.
Witness went with Purdy from the Bowery down Chatham st.,
from Chatham st. to Broadway, and from Broadway down Ce-
dar to the corner of Cedar and Greenwich sts. where Purdy
left witness, promising to meet him at a barber's shop at or near
the corner of Courtlandt st. Witness went into the house of
Madame Restell and saw a woman.
   Cross-examined—Purdy first proposed to witness to go; never
saw Mr. Lohman. Witness knew of the prosecution by seeing
the Recorder, District Attorney and Justice Merritt go there.
Purdy told witness he had got an indictment against Madame
Restell.
   The testimony then closed on both sides. Mr. Morrill com-
menced and concluded an able and forcible summing-up speech
to the Court and jury for the defence. He was followed by Mr.
Jordan on the same side, in an eloquent and argumentative
speech, and Mr. J. B. La Forge and the District Attorney with
great ability and power, summed up for the prosecution.
   The Recorder then charged the jury at length as to the law
and facts of the case, after which they retired to their chamber.
   After an absence of about five minutes the jury returned into
Court with a verdict of GUILTY—on the third and fourth
counts of the indictment, which charge the operation with in-
struments.
   Mr. Jordan moved an arrest of judgement, to give time to pre-
pare for carrying up the case to the Supreme Court, and the
Court gave time to the first day of the next term.
   The accused was not in Court at the rendering of the ver-
dict, nor at any time during the summing up of yesterday.
   The peroration of the summing-up speech of Mr. Whiting,
the District Attorney, was exceedingly eloquent, powerful and
pathetic, and drew tears of the eyes of Court and jury, and
also from his own. He spoke full three hours and a half.
   The Grand Jury came into Court with a number of bills, re-
ceived the thanks of the Court and were discharged. They
found 70 bills during the term, and dismissed 26 complaints.
   The jury were discharged for the term, and the Court ad-
journed to this day 11 o'clock.

	GENERAL SESSIONS—Yesterday.
   Before the Recorder, Judges Lynch and Noah, and
Ald. Balis and Woodhull.
   The Grand Jury came into Court and presented a
number of bills, and were discharged with the thanks
of the Court, for the term.
   In the case of <u>Madam</u> Restell, Mr. Morrill, her
associate counsel, stated that since yesterday, he had
received information that a certain person had been
requested by the husband of Mrs. Purdy, to call on
the accused for the purpose of asking her if he,
Purdy, would absent himself and his witnesses from
the city and not bring the case to trial, if she would
give him a certain amount of money.
   Mr. Whiting the District Attorney, objected to the
testimony being taken, as the whole of the evidence
was closed. The Court however decided that it
should be admitted.
   Huron Betts (sworn,) was requested by Mr. Purdy
to go to the house of <u>Madam</u> Restell, three or four
weeks ago, and ask her if she would pay a certain
sum of money if Purdy would withdraw himself from
the city. He went and saw a lady there.
   The Counsel, <i>pro</i> and <i>con.</i> then commenced sum-
ming up the case, which under the charge of the
Court was given to the Jury at 8 o'clock, P. M.
   The Jury retired and after being absent about five
minutes returned with a verdict of G<small>UILTY</small>. Mr. Jor-
dan moved that Judgment be suspended until next
term, in order that the objections raised during the
trial might pass the ordeal of the Supreme Court.—
The motion was granted, and the Court adjourned.

   The Court announced that the Grand Jury having
found three bills of indictment against James Gordon
Bennett, Editor of the Herald, for libels, he would be
required to give bail to answer in $1000 on each
charge.

<b>The Three Indictments—or Grand Farce for
			1841.</b>
   At the instigation of Mordecai <u title="Manasseh (a.k.a. Manuel)">M<s>anassa</s>h</u> Noah,
formerly Judge in Israel, on Grand Island, now a
Judge of the Sessions, for trying petty rogues in New
York, we have been indicted by the Grand Jury, on
three several bills, for reporting the proceedings of
that Court erroneously, and for bringing two of its
judges, Noah and Lynch, into contempt with the
people.
	...
   Seriously, however, this affair is one of the most
farcical that ever took place. Ever since we started
the Herald, and gave signs of success, Noah, as edi-
tor of the “Evening Star,” has done all he could to
break down our establishment, and destroy our char-
acter. On two or three several occasions, this amia-
ble man, the same who traversed Grand Island in a
tragic costume from the Park, instigated the un-
thinking portion of the press, to denounce the Herald
and its editor. Last year he started and kept up the
“moral war” by every kind of libel and falsehood,
in order to break us down. Failing before this dis-
criminating public, he has, on the first occasion,
seized on a report of a petty larceny trial, issues an
informal edict against our reporter, and gets the
grand jury to indict us for contempt of him and his
talents. Be it so. It will, indeed, be a trial—not a
trial of us—but the veritable trial of Noah and Lynch,
to ascertain whether they have the right or the capa-
city to sit on that bench, and set as they have done.
We deny both, and shall calmly furnish the proof,
under the constitution of the state, which allows
<i>the truth to be given in evidence in all such cases</i>. It is,
therefore, in fact, the trial of Noah and Lynch—no
more—no less.
   The following is a copy of the indictment No. 1:—
<m9>	<b>True Copy of Bill of Indictment.</b>
  (Taken in District Attorney's Office, July 20th, 1841.)
C<small>ITY AND</small> C<small>OUNTY OF</small> N<small>EW</small> Y<small>ORK, SS</small>.
	...
   That James Gordon Bennett, of the City of New York,
editor, printer, and publisher of the New York Herald,
well knowing the premises, <i>being a person of a depraved
and wicked mind, and of a malicious temper and disposition</i>,
disregarding and despising the laws of this State, and
most unlawfully, wickedly, maliciously, and deliberate-
ly, devising, contriving, and intending to traduce, vilify,
and <i>bring into contempt and detestation</i>, the said M. M. Noah
and James Lynch, associate Judges as aforesaid, and to
insinuate, and as far as in him (the said James Gordon
Bennett) lay, to cause it to be believed <i>that the said M. M.
Noah and James Lynch were unfit to preside at the said Court</i>,
and to hold them up to public ridicule and scorn, and to
bring them into ridicule, scandal, contempt, and disgrace
on the 17th day of June, in the year 1841, <i>with force* and
arms</i> at the Second Ward of the City and County of New
York, most unlawfully, wickedly, and maliciously, did
print and publish, and cause and procure to be printed
and published in a certain newspaper, entitled the
“New York Herald,” of and concerning the said M. M.
Noah and James Lynch, so being such associate judges,
as aforesaid, in their office of associate judges, as afore-
said, respectively as aforesaid, and also of and concern-
ing their respective acts and doings as such associate
judges, a certain, false, wicked, scandalous, infamous, and
malicious libel, entitled “Court of Sessions,” in which
said libel are contained, among other things, divers
false, scandalous, and malicious matters, according to the
tenor following, to wit:—
   * Note—Probably meaning steam power.
———
			[Copy from paper of June 17.]
   “ The proceedings in this miserable hole yesterday,
which is called by some the 'Henroost Court,' (meaning
the said Court of General Sessions of the Peace,) were of
little interest. George Rankin, the witness introduced
in Noah's (meaning the said M. M. Noah, associate
Judge aforesaid) celebrated <u title="No COFFEE in Herald-1841-06-17">coffee</u> trial, was tried and
convicted of burglary, in breaking into and stealing cof-
fee from Mr. Merle's store.”
   <u title="And">An</u> in another part of the same libel are contained di-
vers other false, scandalous, and malicious matters, ac-
cording to the tenor following:—
			[Copy from paper of June 17.]
   “ A motion was made and argued at some length by W.
H. Attree, that the Court (meaning the said Court of Gen-
eral Sessions of the Peace) do rescind the order made in
relation to him the day before, because it was, as the Re-
corder said, informal, i. e. illegal, done without evidence
or notice to show cause; <i>was written by Noah</i> (meaning
the said M. M. Noah, associate Judge aforesaid) <i>alone</i>, the
Recorder considering it informal, and the two Aldermen
dissenting from it. The Court (meaning the said Court
of General Sessions of the Peace) will doubtless take
time to consider of it before they (meaning the said Court
of General Sessions of Peace) expunge their illegal
and ridiculous act. We (himself the same James Gor-
don Bennett meaning) shall give full particulars hereaf-
ter. M. M. Noah, (meaning the said Mordecai M. Noah,
associate Judge aforesaid,) <i>the so-called Judge, for a very
short period</i> shook like an aspen leaf, and <i>was as red as an
old turkey hen</i> (meaning the said M. M. Noah was red like
a turkey hen) the whole day, on account of what appear-
ed in the Herald, (meaning the said newspaper entitled
the 'New York Herald.') He (meaning the said M. M.
Noah, associate Judge as aforesaid) denied, like a false
old fool as he (meaning the said M. M. Noah was a fool)
is, that he had any thing to do with the 'Star,' and said
nothing till towards night, when he (meaning the said
M. M. Noah) fell asleep. Mr. Lynch (meaning the said
James Lynch, associate Judge as aforesaid) <i>looked ridicu-
lous the whole day</i>, and was laughed at by Tallmadge,
Whiting, the Aldermen, and all the lawyers <i>for his folly</i>,
(meaning the said James Lynch's folly)—to the great
scandal, infamy and disgrace of the said M. M. Noah and
James Lynch, so being such associate Judges as afore-
said, in manifest perversion and violation of the laws of
this State, and to the evil and pernicious example of all
others, and against the peace of the People of the State of
New York and their dignity.
				“ WHITING, District Attorney.</m9>
   Such is the first Indictment. We desire, there-
fore, the whole country to prepare for this funny,
curious, wonderful, strange, witty, legal, pitiful, far-
cical, philosophical, and poetical trial—not, in fact,
our trial, but the trial of Noah and Lynch for hold-
ing seats on the bench, to which they have no right
under the constitution of the State or the corpora-
tion immunities of this city. Our reporters are all
ready—their lamps trimmed and their lights shining.

			<b>General Sessions.</b>
Present—The Recorder, Judges Noah and one Alder-
				man.
   J<small>ULY</small> 20—<i>The Restell Case</i>.—David D. Marvin examin-
ed by the District Attorney. I am a physician, residing
at No. 80 Green street. In the month of July, <u title="1839 in Tribune-1841-07-20">1837</u>, at-
tended Mrs. Purdy. Found her laboring under severe
pains. It was one or two days before she was delivered,
and I am inclined to believe that it was premature.
   Cross-examined by <u>Jordon</u>—First knew Mrs. Purdy in
the spring of 1838. After her premature delivery she
partly recovered, but from exposure to inclement wea-
ther and other imprudent causes, was again laid up.—
She was a woman of ordinary intellect, very fickle mind-
ed, not illiterate, but easy, and in the habit of visiting
her neighbors considerably. I have seen her with a man
of the name of <u>Moubray</u>, both with and without her hus-
band. She said her premature pains had been brought
on by severe washing. I remember she made an affida-
vit about a pawn ticket, and I accompanied her to the
pawnbrokers for the purpose of getting some trinkets
and a watch which had been pledged. The Court call-
ed on the learned counsel to produce the affidavit. I had
the watch placed with me for safe keeping, but<u> </u>was de-
stroyed by accidentally coming in contact with quicksil-
ver. I do not know that the watch was ever taken to
Madame Restell. Neither myself nor my wife ever went
with Mrs. Purdy to see Madame Restell. Mrs. P. was
about until the winter of 1840—41, and her complaints
was pulmonary consumption.
   The District Attorney rested his case.
   John A. Morrill opened the case for the defence, and
offered the examination of Madame Restell, which the
Court overruled.
   Barrow A. Cohen examined—I am a clerk in the pawn
shop of Mr. Levy, No. 5 Division street; was there in
1839. I do not recollect either last witness or Mrs. Purdy.
I have an affidavit made by Mrs. P. This document was
handed to Morrill, who read the papers. They were a
list of articles pledged, as the paper says, Feb. 12, 1839,
and an affidavit, signed by Emeline Purdy, swearing
that the pawn ticket for those articles had been lost. The
goods pledged were a watch, pencil case, and two rings,
worth $16.
   W. W. Purdy recalled and examined—I never called at
Madame Restell's for the articles left with her. I now
live at Harlem and keep a public house, having <i>been wor-
ried since my last examination in this case</i>. I have often
been to newspaper offices to state that I had been dis-
charged by the Rail Road Company in consequence of
this charge against Madame Restell. Wigham told me
this. The President never charged me with embezzling
the monies of the company. I never offered to settle
this charge with Madame Restell for money. I never
sent any one to her to make such an offer, nor author-
ized any body to go on such an errand.
   At this point of the case the testimony was said to be
closed, but on the Grand Jury coming into Court at a
subsequent period, Mr. Morrill applied to the Court for
permission to examine Mr. Huron Betts, a member of their
body, as to a particular fact deposed to by Purdy.
   The District Attorney said this permission could not be
granted. First, it was irregular; secondly, it was irrel-
evant; and thirdly, the testimony was closed by the
consent of both sides and could not be re-opened.
   The Recorder said that in a case like this even if there
was a little irregularity he should consent to the exami-
nation of the witness, for he should prefer erring on the
side of the defendant, than to shut out any portion of
testimony.
   Huron Betts examined—I know W. W. Purdy. Saw
him yesterday, and have seen him occasionally for the
last three or four months. About three weeks since he
asked me if I would go to Madame Restell's for him. I
said yes. He then said if she would give him some mo-
ney he would leave the city himself and keep his wit-
nesses out of the way also. He did not tell me the price
he wanted. Purdy and myself accordingly started from
the Bowery, and went down Chatham square to Cedar
street, where he said he would wait for me in a Barber's
shop. I went to Madame Restell's house and saw the lady
to whom I delivered the message.
   Cross-examined by the District Attorney—I had known
Purdy long before he asked me to go to Madame Restell.
I don't know Restell's husband.
   The case was here closed.
   Mr. Morrill then addressed the Jury on behalf of the
accused, and went over all the law applicable to cases of
this kind. The learned gentleman cited numerous au-
thorities from the books, and instanced numerous cases,
which he brought to bear on the case before the Court
and Jury, and wound up by a powerful and eloquent ap-
peal to the Jury to exert their judgement, and not permit
either passion, prejudice, or feeling to influence them in
condemning an innocent woman.
   Mr. <u>Jordon</u> followed, in his usual eloquent invective,
and gave one of the witnesses such a dose of bitter aloes
as must have produced a very uncomfortable state of
feelings.
   Mr. LaForge and the District Attorney performed their
parts, and then the Court charged the Jury that the first
and second counts in the indictment were bad, and that
if the accused was convicted at all, she must be under
the 3d and 4th counts, which charge the procuring of
abortion by instruments; and it would become a question
for the Jury, whether that charge was supported. His
Honor then took a review of the case, and left it for the
Jury to say whether the accused was innocent or not.
   The Jury retired for about twenty minutes, and found
a verdict of G<small>UILTY</small>.
   The counsel for the accused moved for a suspension of
judgement until the August term, which was granted.
   And the Court adjourned.

<b>The Great Indictments of 1841—The Real
			Pickwick Papers.</b>
   The publication of the first indictment against the
Herald, for ridiculing Noah and Lynch, which in-
dictment, for distinction's sake, may be called the
great “Turkey Hen” indictment, (as the saying that
a similitude between a highly respectable old turkey
hen and the Judge is the <i>gravamen</i> of the libel) had
produced a wonderful sensation in this community.
Every body is asking—“who was the grand jury that
presented that bill?” “They have outstripped Field-
ing or Dickens in true literary genius.” “These in-
dictments are the real Pickwickian papers—yes,
even Pickwick himself must have been chairman,
and had a hand in them.” God bless this grand jury,
says poor I.
   Be all this as it may, we give on this occasion the
second of these inimitable papers, which, for dis-
tinction's sake, may be called the “Grand Pork In-
dictment for 1841,” and the putting the word (not
the steak) pork into the mouth of a Hebrew judge
is the gist of the charge. [See Laws of Moses—also
Talmud, &c.] Here it is:—
<m9><b>Second Indictment—or the Pork Indictment.</b>
   C<small>ITY AND</small> C<small>OUNTY OF</small> }
	N<small>EW</small> Y<small>ORK</small>,	} <small>SS</small>.
   The jurors of the people of the state of New York, in
and for the body of the city and county of New York, on
their oath, present: That long before, and at the time, of
composing, printing, and publishing the several scanda-
lous and malicious libels, hereinafter mentioned, and long
before, and at the several times and occasions, in and by
the said libels mentioned and alluded to, Mordecai M.
Noah was an Associate Judge of the Court of General
Sessions of the Peace, in and for the city and county of
New York, and as such Associate Judge, was duly em-
ployed and engaged in the exercise of his judicial duties,
in the said Court, as such Associated Judge; that the said
Court of General Sessions of the Peace was duly held in
and for the city and county of New York, at the Halls of
Justice of the said city, in the first Monday of June, in
the year one thousand eight hundred and forty-one, and
was continued, from day to day, from the first Monday in
June to and including the fourth Wednesday thereafter,
before the judges thereof; that the said Mordecai M.
Noah presided at the said Court, during the said term, as
such Associate Judge, as aforesaid; that James Gordon
Bennett, of the city of New York, editor, printer, and
publisher of the New York Herald, well knowing the
premises, being a person of depraved and wicked mind,
and of a malicious temper and disposition, disregarding
and despising the laws of this state, and most unlawful-
ly, wickedly, and maliciously, and deliberately devising,
combining, and intending to traduce, vilify, and bring in-
to contempt and detestation the said Mordecai M. Noah,
Associate Judge as aforesaid, and insinuate, and, as far as
in him, the said James Gordon Bennett, lay, to cause to
be believed, that the said Mordecai M. Noah was unfit to
preside at the said Court, and to hold him up to public
ridicule and scorn, and to bring him into ridicule, scan-
dal, contempt, and disgrace, on the sixteenth day of June,
in the year one thousand eight hundred and forty one,
with force and arms, at the second ward of the city
	...
infamous libel, entitled, “Another curious scene in the
Court of Sessions, in which Noah (meaning the said M.
M. Noah), the new judge in Israel, figures largely,” in
which said libel are contained, among other things, di-
vers false, scandalous, and malicious matters, concerting
to the tenor following, to wit:—
				(Copy.)
   “ No stranger should leave this city without paying a
	...
				(Copy.)
   “ On this Judge Noah, (meaning the said M. M. Noah,
&c.,) <i>who is so fat, and sleek, and slippery</i>, that he frequent-
ly almost tumbles asleep on the bench, or looks like it,
which is much the same, roused himself, and cried out—
'<i>Pork! pork! what's that about pork?</i>' The Recorder,
who loves a joke as dearly as any man living, and who
frequently <i>laughs in his sleeve at the ignorance of law dis-
played by his associates</i>, turned round to Noah, (meaning
the said M. M. Noah,) and observed, 'Brother Noah,
(meaning the said M. M. Noah,) as this case of stealing
pork seems to lay legitimately on your side of the bench,
suppose you try it.' 'Pork! pork!' said Noah, (meaning
the said Mordecai Manasseh Noah said 'pork,') '<i>who'd
ever think of stealing pork?</i>' to the <i>great scandal, infamy
and disgrace of the said</i> Mordecai Manasseh Noah,” &c.
&c. &c. &c. &c. &c.		WHITING, District Attorney.</m9>
   Here is a mess of pork steaks, fried and peppered
by the Pickwickian jury, which beats any thing in
Dickens, including Barnaby Rudge and all the num-
bers yet to be published by the New World or the
Brother Jonathan. To represent the venerable and
amiable Judge Noah, as using the word “pork” on
any occasion, is just as libellous as to force pork
steaks into his mouth to allay his hunger. Both are
contrary to the Talmud, which, in book 10, chapter
42, verse 101, sayeth—“He that tasteth pork is a
brute—he that toucheth pork is a beast—and he that
nameth pork is damned.” It must have been an
error, therefore, in our reporter, ever to have repre-
sented the mild and sweet-<u>tem-pered</u> Judge as using
such words.
   To enter into a minute legal analysis of all the
various points in these indictments, would occupy
more time than we can spare to-day. If, however,
to charge those individuals, whose appointments as
judges are not recognised by the Corporation, with
being “red in the face like an old turkey hen”—or
“indifferent lawyers”—or using the terms “pork!
pork!” or any, or all the matters therein enume-
rated—if these are indictable for contempt, what
shall be said of the charges made, within a year and
a day, of Ex-Recorder Morris by all the respectable
papers in Wall street? Can any lawyer answer this
question? “Thief”—“paper snatcher”—“violator
of a man's hearth”—“midnight robber”—and scores
of such epithets were applied to the late Recorder
by the “pipe-laying press<u title="”—">—</u>to a judge too, of whose
authority and appointment no one else disputed—
whose legal attainments all believed. Why have not
the grand jury presented these much more malig-
nant cases? Noah and Lynch are not considered le-
gal or constitutional judges. Their appointment was
predicated on a law which violated the “vested
rights” of the city of New York. It is a sacred prin-
ciple of the whig party that a legislature cannot
annul or change a charter without the consent of
the chartered party, whose rights are touched upon.
This principle has been violated by the last two
legislatures—for to this day the Corporation of New
York refuses to sanction these two appointments.
If Noah and Lynch are not legal and constitutional
judges, what then?
   This we shall examine hereafter.

<b>The Opening of the Third Seal—The Grand
	Coffee, or Tom Ritchie Indictment.</b>
   If the good, old, venerable Recorder Riker be
alive,—
		“Blessings on his frosty pow,”
We trust and hope he will put on his silver specs,
and read these famous indictments from beginning
to end.
   Recorder Riker was a choice one in his day.—
With extraordinary knowledge of criminal law—
great honesty and humanity—he, nevertheless, loved
a joke as he did his own soul—it was his bread, his
butter, his bitters and all. Yet he always preserved
the dignity of the bench and his own reputation,
amid all the shafts of opposition, envy, or malice.
Even the inimitable Halleck himself, gave immorta-
lity to “Dear Dick Riker” in <a href="http://archive.org/details/poeticalwritings00halluoft">his verses</a>, and the
venerable X read and enjoyed them as much as any
body.
   When we supported and recommended Noah for
the seat he fills, we thought and hoped that the
mantle of “Dear Dick Riker” would have fallen
upon him, and that he would have made a truly
great man in mind, as he is in fat. Alas! what a
vain hope! For some cause or other, probably be-
cause the Corporation, “being of a depraved heart,
wickedly, maliciously, and with malice aforethought”
refuses to pay his salary, our old friend and fellow
sufferer gets up indictments against us, of which the
annexed is the third, <i>alias</i> the great Tom-Ritchie,
or wig-shaking indictment:—
<m9>   <b>The Coffee, or Tom Ritchie Indictment.</b>
C<small>ITY AND</small> C<small>OUNTY OF</small> N<small>EW</small> Y<small>ORK, SS</small>.
   The jurors of the people of the State of New York, in
	...
Court, and James Pollock and Frederick R. Lee, Alder-
men of the said city, Judges of the said Court, one James
Ritchie, who stood indicted before the said Court, on a
charge of felony, receiving stolen goods, knowing them
to have been stolen, which goods, it was alleged, con-
sisted of a large quantity of coffee, contained in a large
number of bags, was arraigned at the bar thereof, and
put upon his trial, by a jury, before the said Court, ac-
	...
certain newspaper, entitled the New York Herald, New
York, Tuesday morning, June 15, 1841, of and concerning
the said trial, and of and concerning the said Judges of
the said Court, and of and concerning the said M. M.
Noah, so being such Associate Judge as aforesaid, and of
and concerning the evidence given upon the said trial,
and of the questions put, and observations made, by the
said M. M. Noah upon the said trial, a certain false, ma-
licious, wicked, and scandalous, and infamous libel, en-
titled,
   “<a class="l" href="#Herald-1841-06-15">A curious trial for receiving stolen <u>goods</u></a>.”
   In which said libel are contained, among other things,
divers false, scandalous, and malicious matters, to wit:
“Judge Noah—(meaning to designate the said M. M.
Noah as the person putting a question)—How's that?
Did you, (meaning George Griffin, who was sworn and
then under examination as a witness on the said trial,)
steal the coffee?” “Surprised,” (meaning that the said
M. M. Noah appeared or looked surprised.) “Griffin—
(meaning to designate the said George Griffin as the per-
son answering)—I'll tell you; (meaning the said M. M.
Noah,) the first I (meaning himself, the said George Grif-
fin) saw of any coffee being stolen from Merle's store, was
when I saw George Rankin and Tom Ritchie.” “Judge
Noah—(meaning the said M. M. Noah)—laughing and
looking with a knowing nod and a chuckle towards the
Recorder, (<i>meaning that the said Mordecai Manasseh Noah,
whilst presiding as judge on said trial, was laughing and
looking, with a knowing nod and a chuckle, towards the Hon-
orable Frederick A. Tallmadge, Recorder of the City of New
York, then also presiding as a judge of said Court on said
trial</i>,) what's that you say?—Tom Ritchie?” “Grif-
fin—(meaning to designate the said George Griffin as the
person answering)—Yes, sir, Tom Ritchie.” Laughter,
(meaning that there was laughter in the court.) “Judge
Noah—(meaning to designate, &c.)—Did Tom Ritchie
steal any coffee?” (Laughter.) “Hays—(meaning Ja-
cob Hays, High Constable of said court, &c.) (Angrily,)
Silence in court. Gentlemen, this is no laughing matter,
if Tom Ritchie did steal coffee.” “Recorder—(meaning
the said F. A. Tallmadge,) to Noah (meaning, &c.)—Hays
calls you to order, Brother Noah,” (<i>meaning that the said
Hays had called the said Mordecai Manasseh Noah to order</i>,)
“Judge Noah—Oh, I (meaning, &c.) only laughed to
think that there is so little in the name of citizen Ritchie.
Go on.”
   And in another part of the said libel are contained di-
vers other false, scandalous and malicious matters, ac-
cording to the tenor following:—
   “Noah—Stop—not so fast—I want to get all this down
about Tom Ritchie.
   Griffin—James Ritchie was not present.
   Noah—But Tom Ritchie was. (Laughter.)
   Griffin—Yes. The next time George and I went and
got six bags of coffee; and Tom remained below and took
them.
   Noah—Tom Ritchie was on the ground that time<u>?</u>
	...
   “Judge Noah (meaning, &c.) we (meaning the judges
of the said court) <i>found it difficult to identify the pork the
other day</i>. (Roars of laughter.) And the man was dis-
charged. Coffee kernels are queer things to recognize.”
   To the great scandal, infamy, and disgrace of the
Judges of the said Court, and <i>particularly to</i> the said
<u title="Mordecai">Mordeica</u> Manasseh Noah, &c. &c. &c., and against the
peace and dignity of the people of the State of New
York.				WHITING, District Attorney.</m9>
   Here closes the third and last of these inimitable
papers. Talk no longer of the Glentworth papers—
the indictment papers take the rag off the bush en-
tirely. So exquisite are they, that we should not be
surprised to see some poetic genius transfuse the
whole into poetry, and give them to fame and to eter-
nity at once. In the meantime, we shall call upon
the next Grand Jury to indict the whole Wall street
press, for a worse contempt upon Ex<u> </u>Recorder
Morris.
   Seriously, however, these indictments have pro-
duced such a singular effect upon the community,
that the “Evening Star,” Noah's old paper, for
which he yet writes, has to come to his rescue, and
try to give a tragic air to this curious farce. But it
will be seen that its terrible, violent, foolish tirade,
in only a re-hash of the old falsehoods and libels
which Noah published in the same paper last year.
<i>There is not one word of truth in this tirade, from be-
ginning to end</i>. We could enter into details, but it is
useless and unnecessary. The weak attempt to get
up indictments on such flimsy charges, cannot be
propped up by a whole column of libels. This is the
fourth, the last, and the cheapest edition of the
“moral war,” to put the Herald down—the mana-
ger's last kick, and it will end as that did.

of July been pretty much used up for the season; but this
year it grows greener and fresher with each succeeding sun
and shower. Hundreds, who have hitherto gone into the
Country during the dog-days, this year stay at home, enjoy
its comforts, and add those of the Country to them by spend-
ing now a morning and then an afternoon at 'green Hoboken,'
and taking their lemonade amid the deep, delicious shades
surrounding Castle Point. In this way, they enjoy the plea-
sures and health-bearing breezes of the Country without pur-
chasing them at the dear rate of sweating over dusty roads,
up rugged steeps, in shackling vehicles, eating food that the
dog would not touch at home, and sleeping in temporary
quartes that do not bear to be thought of. The change is a
judicious one, and we commend the example to others.

   On Sunday evening, during the thunder shower,
the house of Mr. Stuart D. Howe, in Thirty-sixth

lightning, which tore up several of the shingles of
the roof of the house, but did not communicate fire
to the building. Several individuals in the house
were stunned by the shock. Mr. Howe saw the

blasphemous and filthy article entitled “Fanny <i>Divine</i> and the
Sculptor,” when it arrested our attention in <i>The Sun</i>. We spoke of
that article and <i>The Sun</i>'s agency in circulating it as they deserved;
and for this the <i>Advertiser</i> (which we had never mentioned,) falls
foul of us, and basely accuses us of advertising Mad. Restell's medi-
cines, because we allowed a person on whose conduct we had severely
commented, and who had been convicted of misdemeanor, to request
through our columns a <i>suspension of the public judgement</i> upon her case
until her application for a new trial should be decided on. Could we
have decently refused this poor privilege to the vilest human being?
—But what had this to do with advertising her <i>medicines</i>? And yet
for admitting this Card, the Advertiser basely charges us with “<i>advo-
cacy and support of Madame Restell!</i>”—After this, who will wonder
at the impudent standing lie of that paper that it prints and circulates
“<i>Ten Thousand Copies Daily?</i>” Why not say 100,000 at once?

   C<small>OURT OF</small> S<small>ESSIONS</small>, July 20.—The case of <u>Mad-
am</u> Restell closed in her conviction on the third and
fourth counts of the indictment, which charge the
procurement of abortion with instruments. The
Court charged that the two first counts were not sup-
ported. It occupied the Jury only five minutes to
decide upon a verdict. Motion was made by pris-
oner's counsel that the sentence should be suspended
until the August term; and the Court so ordered.
   In conducting this case the counsel on both sides
have shown great legal skill and industry; and the
court has evinced s leniency to the prisoner which
leaves her on no ground to complain. The husband
appears to have suffered as much by the evidence,
nearly, as <u>Madam</u> Restell, for evidence was addu-
ced that he has made distinct overtures to <u>Madam</u> to
go out of town, and withhold his witnesses for a

   A H<small>ORRIBLE</small> M<small>URDER</small>.—On Sunday morning week, Miss
Cecilia Rogers, (who formerly attended John Anderson's
Tobacco Store in Broadway, and was known as 'The beauti-
ful Cigar Girl,') left her home, 126 Nassau-st., for a walk;
and at the corner of Theatre Alley she was met and accosted
by a young man, apparently an acquaintance, with whom she
proceeded toward Barclay-st. as if for an excursion to Hobo-
ken. Nothing farther was heard of her that day by her
friends; and, alarmed by her non-appearance, they advertised
for her in Tuesday's papers. Still nothing was seen or heard
of her till Wednesday, when Mr. H. G. Luther and two other
gentlemen, who were passing the Sybil's Cave, near Castle
Point, Hoboken, in a sail-boat, were shocked by the sight of
the body of a young female in the water. They brought it
ashore, a Coroner's Inquest was summoned, and it was proved
to be the body of Miss Rogers, and it was evident that she
had been horribly outraged and murdered! The Inquest re-
turned a verdict of Murder by some person or persons un-
known.
   We understand that the deceased was a young woman of
good character, and was soon to have been married to a
worthy young man of this City. It is added that suspicion
rests on a young man who has absented himself from the City
since the murder was committed.

   C<small>ORONER'S</small> O<small>FFICE</small>.—An inquest was held on Saturday
on the body of William Henry <u>Plugh</u>, aged 25. It ap-
peared that the deceased was a native of New Jersey,
and worked on board of steamboats. On Wednesday
night he went with a friend to the fire in Desbrosses
street, being a little the worse for liquor. While at the
fire he worked with one of the engine companies and his
friend could not get him away from that exciting amuse-
ment and left him there. Plugh was to have slept that
night on board the steamer Providence, but did not, and
was not heard of until Friday night, when his body was
found in the North River with a cut across the lower
jaw. After a patient investigation, it was the opinion of
the Jury, that the deceased was accidentally drowned
while endeavoring to get on board the steamer. A ver-
dict was therefore recorded in accordance with those
facts.</f>

has been seduced from her home and murdered within
hail of this very populous place. The city was full of
rumors yesterday, got up for the basest and most merce-
nary matters, but on inquiry in quarters likely to be well
informed, we could not find that any of these catchpenny
stories had the least foundation in truth. Some persons
even went so far as to say, that a young gentleman well
known in the fashionable world, had been arrested at a
brothel and had confirmed his guilt to one of the New
York Police, but this, like the other <i title="hearsay">on dits</i>, proved to be
a mere fabrication. Another story afloat was, that the
services of the city Police have been for some days in
requisition, and in order to ensure the arrest of a suspect-
ed person, when in point of fact our vigilant Police were
ignorant of the fatal occurrence until yesterday.

   <b>The Late Murder of a Young Girl at Ho-
		boken.</b>
   It is now well ascertained that the unfortunate
young girl, named Mary Rogers, (who three years
ago, lived with Anderson, the cigar man) has been
cruelly murdered at Hoboken. Nothing of so horri-
ble and brutal a nature has occurred since the murder
of Miss Sands, which murder formed the basis of the
story of Norman Leslie. This young girl, Mary
Rogers, was missing from Anderson's store, three
years ago, for two weeks. It is asserted that she
was then seduced by an officer of the U. S. Navy,
and kept at Hoboken for two weeks. His name is
well known on board his ship.
   Be that as it may, the mother of Mary kept a re-
spectable boarding house, for the last two years, at
126 Nassau st. Here Mary lived ever since the
house was opened, and was the main stay of her
mother. She did all the marketing, and conducted
herself with the utmost propriety. She has not
been at Anderson's hole for nearly two years.—
On Sunday <u title="sennight, se'nnight">sen'night</u>, she left her mother's purposing
to go to church with the children of her aunt, who
lives in Greenwich street. As all the family were
out of town, the aunt does not know whether she
called there or not. The next time she was heard
of was on Wednesday last, when she was found
dead,—murdered,—near the Sybil's cave, at Hobok-
en. It now remains for the mayor of New York and
Jersey cities to do their duties.

<d>[Col.1]</d>
   Under our Police head, we yesterday reported the
murder of a young lady of this city, at Hoboken.—
There are circumstances connected with this bloody
deed of unusual atrocity, and we are therefore indu-
ced to call public attention more pointedly to it, than
in our wont with the crimes, of which unfortunately
this city, like all large cities, is so often the theatre.
The unfortunate girl, as far as we can learn, was of
blameless character, but was induced, probably in a
thoughtless moment, to accompany a young man to
Hoboken, where she was decoyed to a secluded spot,
violated and murdered. This could not have been
the act of one; it must have been committed by
more; it has every appearance of having been concert-
ed, and thus almost stands unparallelled among the
deeds of blood of which we read.
   It seems incredible that men could deliberately plan
and commit a murder for such a motive, yet the facts
inevitably lead to the conclusion that this is one of
those unnatural instances of horrid crime, which sets
all reason at defiance. Ten days have now elapsed
since its commission; hitherto the tracks of its fero-
cious perpetrators have not been discovered, and the
blood of the hapless female will probably pass unre-
venged, unless the public authorities evince more than
ordinary activity. It would seem impossible that
their vigilance should sleep on an occasion which so
loudly calls for its exercise as this, yet we much fear
that unless some strong inducements are offered, the
diabolical crime will pass undetected.
   Whilst writing, we receive the following letter from
the Coroner of Hoboken:
	<i>For the Courier and Enquirer</i>.
   C<small>OL</small>. W<small>EBB</small>:—In consequence of the great, though
just excitement prevailing in this community, relative
to the mysterious and desperate murder of Mary C.
R<small>OGERS</small>, at Hoboken, and in answer, once for all, to
the many inquiries addressed to me, concerning this
most wretched tragedy, I must say, that it is far from
my duty as a Magistrate to give information, or to
answer questions of idle curiosity. On the other
hand, I deem it the duty of every individual that has
the least regard for the well being of society, possess-
ing any knowledge in the matter, to furnish me with
all the facts (however remote they may be,) relative
to her absence and her murder.
   In the mean time, I will assure any one, giving
me information, that their communications shall be
held sacred and confidential, until after an interview,
or until restriction is withdrawn.
			With respect Sir, Yours,
				GILBERT MERRITT,
August 2nd, 1841.			of Hoboken.
   N. B. The character of M<small>ARY</small> C. R<small>OGERS</small>, was

be irreproachable—any published slander to the con-
trary, notwithstanding.

			POLICE—Tuesday.
   Nothing new has been developed, tending to un-
ravel the mystery which hangs about the fate of the
unfortunate girl, Mary C. Rogers, whose dreadful
end has been already chronicled.
   Mr. Justice Merritt, of Hoboken, came to this city
yesterday to consult with our Mayor and Police Ma-
gistrates upon the best means of detecting, if possi-
ble, the perpetrators of this dreadful outrage, but we
could not learn that any immediate success was an-
ticipated. Blank warrants signed by Justice Merritt,
of New Jersey, and countersigned by our acting
Mayor, Ald. Purdy, have been left in this city, to be
used as occasion may require. The main difficulty
now existing, is the fact that the identity of the per-
son, with whom the unfortunate girl was last seen,
cannot be sufficiently made out to warrant positive
proceedings, and it is hoped that any persons having
any information which may aid the authorities in
their efforts to bring the guilty to punishment, will
come forward at once and give it.
   As some of the papers in this city seem to have
forgotten that <i>de mortuis nil nisi bonum</i> should guide
them now, it is due to the memory of the unfortunate
girl to state that several gentlemen gave evidence be-
fore the Coroner's Jury that she was in every re-
spect an estimable girl.
   Two young men were arrested yesterday by officer
A. M. C. Smith, on suspicion of being concerned in
the murder, but as there was no ground to warrant
their detention they were subsequently discharged.
It remains now for our authorities, and others more
directly interested, to offer such rewards as shall
arouse our officers to use all their efforts to discover
the murderers.<f>
   Officer Tappan yesterday brought up four young
market loafers, who had been detected in stealing a
pocket book, containing $37 in money and about $100
worth of pledge tickets, from a woman who keeps a
birds stand in the Washington market. Two or three
of the gang (for these young scamps work in gangs)
managed to engage the owner's attention, and while
thus employed, some one more adroit than the rest,
made off with her pocket book. They are remanded
for examination.
   A man, apparently a German, who was either ex-
cessively stupid, or excessively <u title="tipsy">tipsey</u>, was brought
in last evening by some citizens, whose limbs and
lives he had endangered by driving on the side walk
in Pearl, near Fulton street. After a severe admoni-
tion from the sitting magistrate, he was discharged,
with a caution not to attempt such feats of horse-
manship again.
   Two or three very small larcenies filled up the ba-
lance of the day; and beyond those, nothing at all
occurred worthy of mention.</f>

   T<small>HE</small> H<small>OBOKEN</small> M<small>URDER</small>.—There were a number of
gossipping rumors and much twaddle afloat again yes-
terday, respecting the perpetrators of this <u title="horrid">horried</u> deed.
It would be worse than useless to give currency to
these mercenary lies, and therefore we refrain from ei-
ther repeating or revamping them. We know, on the
authority of a gentleman who went twice yesterday to
the residence of Gilbert Merritt, the Coroner and Ma-
gistrate of Hoboken, that nobody is in detention on that
side the water and it is equally certain that no person is in
custody here, although two young men were taken before
Elijah F. Purdy, Esq. yesterday on some pretence or
other, but discharged. Blank warrants, bearing the
signature of Judge Merritt, of Hoboken, have been for-
warded to the acting Mayor of this city, and by him en-
dorsed, in case suspicion should alight upon any indivi-
dual. We know this is a dangerous if not an illegal re-
sponsibility for a magistrate to assume, but the emer-
gency will go far in extenuation at the bar of public opi-
nion. It is satisfactory also to know that the warrants
thus endorsed in blank have been confided to the care
and custody of a magistrate, in whose hands they are
safe. From the time which has now elapsed since the
perpetration of this daring murder, we fear that it will
ever remain clouded in impenetrable mystery.

 <b>The Murder of Mary Rogers at Hoboken—
	Crowds Visiting the Scene.</b>
   The excitement which prevails in this city and in
Hoboken, relative to the bloody and mysterious mur-
der of Mary Rogers—the crowds daily hurrying to
the Sybil's Cave, to look on the scene of the deed,
and the shore where her body was first discovered—
are beginning to rouse the attention of the public au-
thorities to this foul outrage upon a civilized com-
munity. The coroner at Hoboken is even waked
up, and has published the following curious note:—
<m9>   C<small>OL</small>. W<small>EBB</small>:—In consequence of the great, though just
excitement prevailing in this community, relative to the
mysterious and desperate murder of Mary C. Rogers, at
Hoboken, and in answer, once for all, to the many inqui-
ries addressed to me, concerning this most wretched tra-
gedy, I must say, that it is far from my duty as a magis-
trate to give information, or to answer questions of idle
curiosity. On the other hand, I deem it the duty of eve-
ry individual that has the least regard for the well being
of society, possessing any knowledge in the matter, to
furnish me with all the facts (however remote they may
be,) relative to her absence and her murder.
   In the mean time, I will assure any one, giving me in-
formation, that their communications shall be held sa-
cred and confidential, until after an interview, or until
restriction is withdrawn.
		With respect, sir, yours,
			GILBERT MERRITT,
August 2nd, 1841.		of Hoboken.</m9>
   How utterly ridiculous is all this! It is now near-
ly a week since the dead body of this beautiful and
unfortunate girl had been discovered, and yet no
other steps have been taken by the judicial authori-
ties, than a brief and inefficient inquest by Gilbert
Merritt. One of the most heartless and atrocious
murders that was ever perpetrated in New York, is
allowed to sleep the sleep of death—to be buried in
the deep bosom of the Hudson.
   The murder of this girl must have been a horrible
affair. It was late in the afternoon of last <u>Thursday</u>,
that we were taking a walk along the sea shore, in
Hoboken, towards that beautiful promontory where
the Sybil's Cave pours forth its cool waters to lave
the parched lip of youth. It was a little before sun-
set. The last beams of day were struggling through
the groves above the high cliffs, and shedding a rosy
light across the broad Hudson, to New York. We
met several groups of people coming down. A man
stepped up—“Sir, there is a woman murder-
red up yonder.” “A woman found murdered!—
Where? who?” “I do not know who she is. You
will find the poor creature's corpse just beyond the
point and the cave<u>. “</u>Let us go—let us,” said our
companion.
   We proceeded in the direction. The walk is
beautiful. On the left are the steep marble cliffs,
bare in most places, and overhung with deep green
trees of the forest. On the right, the waves of the
Hudson, rippling up the shore with a gentle murmur.
Beyond the promontory, about half way to the Ely-
sian Fields, there is a green bank that the tide em-
braces up to the edge, at high water. Here, after
jumping down from the bank, groups would stop a
while, stoop over the remains of Mary Rogers, and
pass along. When we saw her, she was <u>laying</u> on
the bank on her back, with a rope around her, and
a large stone attached to it, flung in the water. The
first look we had of her, was most ghastly. Her
forehead and face appeared to have been battered
and butchered to a mummy. Her features were
scarcely visible, so much violence had been done to
her. On her head she wore a bonnet—light gloves
on her hands, with the long watery fingers peering
out—her dress was torn in various portions—her shoes
were on her feet—and altogether, she presented the
most horrible spectacle that eye could see. It al-
most made our heart sick, and we hurried from the
scene, while a rude youth was raising her leg, which
hung in the water, and making unfeeling remarks on
her dress.
   We hastened from the scene. The coroner's jury
was held afterwards, and the result is known.
   Since that day, the crowds flocking to Hoboken
have been immense, and the legends circulated have
been innumerable. Only a few days ago, it is sta-
ted that a poor young man committed suicide, in
the woods above the Elysian Fields. The other day
a man fired a pistol on his wife, who barely escaped
with a deep laceration. All the unfortunate beings
that crowd a large city, seem to go to Hoboken to
get red of their sorrows, or rid of their lives. The
beauty of its groves—the picturesqueness of its cliffs
and creeks—the deep mystery of its wild woods
seem to charm all unfortunates to find their solace
there. It was but the other evening, that, while
wandering ourself under the frowning cliff, with the
big, bright, broad moon, just rising over New York,
and tipping with silver her spires and steeples, that
a poor youth accosted us—“Gentleman, will you
give money to pay my ferriage? I can find now work,
nor have I any thing to eat.”
   We have not heard where Mary Rogers has been
buried.

   <i>The Case of Mary C. Rogers</i>.—Notwithstanding the
vigorous efforts of the authorities here and in New-
Jersey, we regret to state that no clue has as yet been
discovered to the perpetrators of this dreadful tragedy.
The two young men who were arrested here have
been examined and nothing being elicited to warrant
their detention, they were discharged. Justice Mer-
ritt, of Hoboken, caused a young man in Jersey City
to be arrested on suspicion, but after a tedious and
protracted examination he was discharged on Tuesday
night.
   Justice Merritt has addressed a letter to Governor
Pennington, of New-Jersey, and there is no doubt
that he will at once offer a suitable reward for the de-
tection of the murderers. Our Mayor is only await-
ing the action of Gov. Pennington in the premises,
as he conceives that the first offer of a reward should
come from him.
   In a conversation with Dr. Cook, of Hoboken, we
learned that the body of the unfortunate girl showed
evident marks that the most brutal violence had been
resorted to, one of her wrists having been clasped so
tightly, as to leave a mark as of a rope. There were
besides other marks and bruises, showing that the
poor girl had fallen into the hands of some worse than
brutes. It is now generally supposed that the de-
ceased was thrown from the cliff near the Sybil's
Cave, and that the marks on her face were not made
by fists, as was at first supposed, but by coming in
contact with the rocks in her fall.
   As the public mind is generally and justly excited
on this subject, we have transcribed and annex here-
with the main part of the evidence adduced before the
Coroner's Jury, suppressing only such portions as
would, by being made public, interfere with the ends
of justice.
   Since writing the above, officers John Davis and
Colvin have arrested a young man (whose name it is
not necessary to mention,) on suspicion of being con-
cerned in the murder. He was examined, but imme-
diately sent on board the U. S. ship North Carolina,
on board which ship he enlisted the day the body was
found, there being no evidence to warrant his deten-
tion.
		J<small>ULY</small> 28th, 1841—8 o'clock, P. M.
   An inquisition taken at Castle Point, Hoboken, on
the body of a female, found fastened by a rope and
stone, near the shore—by a jury of thirteen men
duly summoned and qualified by Gilbert Merritt, a
Justice of the Peace—
   When Alfred <u>Cromeline</u>, was duly sworn, saith,
that he recognises the deceased, and was well ac-
quainted with her. That her name is Mary C. Rogers,
a resident of No. 126 Nassau street, New York. That
he has known her for a considerable time—having
boarded in her mother's house about six months—
while deceased was the officiating manager of the
family and the main support of an infirm and aged
mother—with the whole charge of conducting the
boarding house.
   Cross-examined by the Justice. The deceased was
seldom in the habit of going out on the Sabbath, ex-
cept to church, and then, not frequently with young
men. Witness is unable to account for her being at
Hoboken on Sunday, the 25th of July, except
decoyed there by artifice. The deceased was
formerly much attached to a young man in New
York,—but has some time since discarded him.
I had no knowledge of her going to Hoboken on the
25th of July—was generally at home and domestic.
To whom was she attached? She was for some time
attached to Mr. *******, but for some time past has
rejected him, and is now attached to Mr. *******, to
whom it was supposed she would have been married.
The deceased has, during the whole time the witness
has known her, borne an irreproachable character for
chastity and veracity. She was amiable and pleas-
ing, and rather fascinating in her manners. Never
heard her virtue questioned in the least.
   Archibald Padley being sworn, saith—The deceased
has a strong resemblance to and no doubt is Mary
C. Rogers; that he has boarded in the house with
Mary C. Rogers, No.126 Nassau street, New York;
that she was a worthy girl, of irreproachable charac-
ter, was attached—[similar to former witness]—had
heard that she was at Hoboken on Sunday, the 25th
of July, but has no knowledge of her associates or
company on that occasion; and that the deceased has
been absent since some time on Sunday last, which
has caused great anxiety and alarm in the family.
Has no knowledge of hostile feeling or ill-will on the
part of any one towards deceased. She was respect-
ed and much esteemed. Cross-exam. Cannot ac-
count for the cause of her absence or murder.
   John Bertram, being sworn—first saw the body
between 3 and 4 o'clock, P. M. in the River, a short
distance from the shore. Was not acquainted with
the deceased—nor had he any knowledge of the mur-
der.
   William Waller, being sworn—saith, that he first
saw the body about half past three o'clock, P.M.,
and caused it to be secured by a rope and stone, until
the Coroner or Justice could be seen. Cross-exam-
ined. Has no knowledge of the deceased—or the
cause of her murder.
   Richard F. Cook—when it was proposed, that Doc-
tor Cook's testimony should be written out by him-
self—and that he, together with Abraham L. Van
<u>Boskirck</u>, two of the jurors, should particularly exam-
ine the whole body, and report the result of such ex-
amination to the inquest, which proposition was duly
accepted by the same, and after a reasonable time, the
deputation reported to the inquest—that “in the per-
formance of their duty, that from marks and bruises,
and * * * * * there were evident signs of the body
having been violated; that * * * * *; and that, the
bruises about the head and face, as well as * * *
* * was sufficient to cause death. * * * .” (<i>a</i>)
   The verdict, as recorded, in the Clerk's office of the
county of Hudson, New Jersey. Signed by the
Magistrate and thirteen Jurors.
   (<i>a</i>) Dr. Cook's written testimony is in the posses-
sion of the Justice, and can be seen by proper appli-
cants, and only such.
   The testimony withheld, the magistrate deems
improper to publish.

   T<small>HE</small> H<small>OBOKEN</small> M<small>URDER</small>.—Yesterday afternoon a fur-
ther examination was held before Justice Merritt and
Parker into the charge brought against the young man
who was suspected of participating in the murder of
Mary Rogers, from the fact of his having entered as a
seaman on board the U. S. ship North Carolina, and go-
ing to do his duty the next day. The circumstances
which are said to implicate this man, are first, that he is a
relation of John Anderson, the cigar man, and had boar-
ded with Mary's mother. He admits the knowing of
Mary, but says very frankly that the last time he saw
her was before he went to New Bedford. That he was
there the day the deed was committed, and returned to
this city on the 27th from Boston. The same day he
went to a shipping agent and said he wanted to ship. The
man said in reply something about it being impossible to
get a ship that night and the next day, which was the
28th, the accused went to the Rendezvous, and enlisted,
got his fit out, with his advance money, and went on
board the same afternoon. This is said to have been the
day the body was discovered, and because sailors do not
usually go to their duty until they have spent their ad-
vance money, this is taken as <i>one very suspicious circum-
stance</i>.
   He denied ever taking Mary out, or having been in the
habit of going out with young men who did. He says
that he never asked her to go out, because he had a girl
whom he was attached to, and he took her out if he took
any one. He says that he always had enough of rowing
and sailing in boats when at sea or on service, and con-
sequently had no inclination to go on the river in boat-
ing excursions when on the shore. He did not go out in
any small boat on Sunday week, and he asserts that he
has <i>not been to Hoboken at all</i> for more than a year.
   On the other hand, John R. Robinson, of 319 Water
street, the shipping agent and boarding house keeper, to
whom this young man applied for a ship on the 27th,
produces a pair of blue canvass trousers and a jack knife,
such as used by sailors, which Robinson says this young
man left behind him. These articles are said to be
stained with something, but with what it would be diffi-
cult to say.
   Then again the appearance, deportment, and mode of
answering questions put to him, and the quiet manner
of this young fellow, are all in his favor. His eye does
not quail nor his cheek blanch while under examina-
tion, and it was the opinion of the police magistrate and
of the majority of the persons admitted to the examina-
tion, that there was no foundation for the charge. Being
of this opinion, we shall not publish his name, unless
there is something more adduced against him.
   As to the other two young men who were arrested on
Wednesday, it is now confidently asserted that their ar-
rest was brought about by the basest and most malignant
means. If this is the case, it is to be hoped that the
grand jury will immediately present the cause thereof
to a public nuisance.<f>
 C<small>ORONER'S</small> O<small>FFICE</small>.—An inquest was held at No. 330
Water street, on the body of Ellen Long, a native of Ire-
land, aged <u title="Age is from Tribune-1841-08-06">32</u>—had been an habitual drunkard for many
years, and died from the effects of her intemperate habits.

loot <s>of 16</s>th street, and had not returned when our re-
porter left the Egyptian Tombs.</f>

   M<small>URDER OF</small> M<small>ARY</small> R<small>OGERS AT</small> H<small>OBOKEN</small>.—This
awful atrocity still continues to be agitated among
all classes. The following is a report of the Coro-
ner's Inquest at Hoboken:—
			I<small>NQUEST</small>.
	H<small>OBOKEN</small>, July 28th, 1841—8 o'clock P.M.
   An inquisition taken at Castle Point, Hoboken, on the
body of a female, found fastened by a rope and stone,
near the shore—by a jury of thirteen men, duly sum-
moned and qualified, by Gilbert Merritt, a Justice of the
Peace—
   When Alfred <u>Cromeline</u>, was duly sworn, saith, that
he recognises the deceased, and was well acquainted
with her. That her name is Mary C. Rogers, a resident
of No. 126 Nassau street, New York. That he has known
her for a considerable time—having boarded in her mo-
ther's house about six months—while deceased was the
officiating manager of the family, and the main support
of an infirm and aged mother—with the whole charge of
conducting the boarding house.
   Cross-examined by the Justice. The deceased was
seldom in the habit of going out on the Sabbath, except
to church, and then, not frequently with young men.—
Witness is unable to account for her being at Hoboken
on Sunday, the 25th of July, except decoyed there by
artifice. The deceased was formerly much attached to a
young man in New York—but has some time since dis-
carded him. I had no knowledge of her going to Hobo-
ken on the 25th of July—was generally at home and do-
mestic. To whom was she attached? She was for some
time attached to Mr. *******, but for some time past has re-
jected him, and is now attached to Mr. *******, to whom
it was supposed she would have been married. The de-
ceased has, during the whole time the witness has known
her, borne an irreproachable character for chastity and
veracity. She was amiable and pleasing, and rather fas-
cinating in her manners. Never heard her virtue ques-
tioned in the least.
   Archibald Padley being sworn, saith—The deceased
has a strong resemblance to, and no doubt is Mary C. Ro-
gers; that he has boarded in the house with Mary C. Ro-
gers, No.126 Nassau street, New York; that she was a
worthy girl, of irreproachable character, was attached—
[similar to former witness]—had heard that she was at
Hoboken on Sunday, the 25th of July, but has no know-
ledge of her associates or company on that occasion; and
that the deceased has been absent since some time on
Sunday last, which has caused great anxiety and alarm
in the family. Has no knowledge of hostile feeling or
ill-will on the part of any one toward the deceased. She
was respected and much esteemed.
   Cross-examined—Cannot account for the cause of her
absence or murder.
   John Bertram, being sworn—first saw the body be-
tween 3 and 4 o'clock, P. M. in the river, a short distance
from the shore. Was not acquainted with the deceased,
nor had he any knowledge of the murder.
   William Waller, being sworn, saith—that he first saw
the body about half past three o'clock, P.M., and caused
it to be secured by a rope and stone, until the Coroner or
Justice could be seen.
   Cross-examined—Has no knowledge of the deceased,
or the cause of her murder.
   Richard F. Cook—when it was proposed, that Doctor
Cook's testimony should be written out by himself, and
that he, together with Abraham L. Van <u>Boskirck</u>, two of
the jurors, should particularly examine the whole body,
and report the result of such examination to the inquest,
which proposition was duly accepted by the same, and
after a reasonable time the deputation reported to
the inquest—that “in the performance of their duty, that
from marks and bruises, and * * * * * there were evident
signs of the body having been violated; that * * * * *; and
that, the bruises about the head and face, as well as * * *
* * was sufficient to cause death. * * * .”
   The verdict, as recorded, in the Clerk's office of the
county of Hudson, New Jersey. Signed by the Magis-
trate and thirteen Jurors.
   From this evidence it seems probable that after the
poor girl was violated, she was thrown from the high
cliffs near Castle Point, and thus precipitated into the
water. There must have been several to perpetrate
this foul outrage. Can no discovery be made of the
felons?

   ☞ The terrible Murder of Miss Rogers excites daily a
deeper and wider interest in our city. Well may it do so.—
A young woman leaves her home on Sunday morning, and is
unheard of till the following <u>Thursday</u>, when she is found
horribly outraged and murdered at Hoboken. A week has
since passed, and no clue to the perpetrator of the awful
crime is yet found. Our police are now on the alert, but we
fear too late. What has the Mayor been doing? We hear
that he awaits the offer of a reward from the Governor of
New-Jersey before offering one himself. This is wrong.
The criminal, probably, no more than the victim, belonged to
New-Jersey; the offence strikes at the safety and peace of
the citizens of New-York.—Who saw Miss Rogers at Hobo-
ken on Sunday week? Will any one who did, and hesitates
to go before the Police, please address a note stating the
facts to this office?

   A<small>RREST ON</small> S<small>USPICION OF</small> M<small>URDER</small>.—Yesterday a young
man, a seaman attached to one of our National vessels, was ta-
ken before Justice Parker of the Police for examination touch-
ing his <u title="= participation">participancy</u> in or knowledge of the murder of Miss
Mary Cecilia Rogers. He was supposed to be the person
whom two gentlemen saw walking with Miss Rogers on Sun-
day afternoon or evening; but although he was well acquainted
with the unfortunate young lady, the two gentlemen, on seeing
him, said at once that he was not the man. After long and
critical interrogatories by the Magistrate, in which nothing to
implicate him was elicited—he was discharged. Mystery, there-
fore, still broods over this dark tragedy, though some of the
Police Officers are constantly on the alert to find out and arrest
the murderer. It is stated that the Governor of New-Jersey is
about to offer a reward for the discovery and arrest of the au-
thors of the bloody deed.

   C<small>ORONER'S</small> O<small>FFICE</small>.—The Coroner yesterday held an inquest
at 330 Water st. on the body of Ellen Long, a native of Ireland,
aged 32 years. The deceased was very intemperate, and had
indulged in excessive drink for a considerable time past. Her
husband left home on Wednesday morning and returned about
<u title="5 in EVENING POST">7</u> o'clock in the evening, when he found her stretched out on
the floor, entirely dead. Dr. W. S. Tompkins executed a post
mortem examination on the body and found the mucus coat of
the stomach, also the intestines much congested, as in cases of
confirmed intemperance, and from his advisory statement, the
jury found a verdict of died from intemperance.
   Also, at the corner of 10th avenue and 16th street, on the
body of Robert Lynn, a native of Ireland, aged 31, a milkman
by occupation. The deceased, in a state of apparent health, on
Tuesday night at 11 o'clock retired to a hay loft in the 10th
avenue, where he was wont, in warm weather, to sleep, and
where he was found dead on Wednesday morning. Dr. W.
S. Tompkins made a post mortem examination, and from the
state of the brain, liver, heart, &c. deduced the opinion that the
deceased died of congestion of the brain and lungs. Verdict
accordingly.
   Also, at the foot of Clarkson st. on the body of a dead infant:
found in the water at the foot of said street. Verdict, still born.

		<m8>Reported for the Courier & Enquirer.</m8>
			POLICE.
   <i>The Case of Mary C. Rogers</i>.—The young man
from the North Carolina who was arrested on suspi-
cion of being concerned in this dreadful affair, was
yesterday brought up again before the Magistrates, it
having been supposed that he could be identified as
the person with whom the deceased was seen on
Sunday morning when she was last seen alive.
   Several persons were there for that purpose, but
they failed to identify him, and he was sent again on
board the North Carolina.
   The circumstances which led to his arrest, are
these: His brother (it is not deemed necessary to
mention their names) was engaged to, or addressing
the deceased, and as the accused was known to have
lived in the house, search was made for him, and he
was found on board the North Carolina, where he
had shipped on the 28th ult. (the day the body was
found) and contrary to the usual custom of sailors,
he was apparently very anxious to get on board the
ship, and was at once sent on board.
   He underwent a pretty close examination by Justice
Parker, as to his habits, occupation and whereabouts,
for the last few weeks, to which he gave pretty fair
answers. He asserted that he had not seen the de-
ceased since the 3d of July, when he staid a short
time at her mother's house, and that so far from
being on intimate terms with her, he had never walk-
ed out with her in his life.
   If anything should occur which will render his
presence again necessary, he can be readily found on
board ship, but it is the opinion of a gentleman at the
Halls of Justice, well versed in all the art of rogue
catching, that this person is entirely innocent.<f>

   T<small>HE</small> M<small>URDER OF</small> M<small>ARY</small> C. R<small>OGERS</small>.—The in-
vestigations of the police are still going on with a
view of discovering the authors of the murder of
this young woman, whose body was found the other
day at Hoboken.
   There is no probability, it appears to us, that
the crime was committed at Hoboken. It is not
likely that a girl like her, of good reputation and
modest manners, could have voluntarily remained
there to a late hour in the evening, and unless that
were the case, there could have been no opportuni-
ty of committing the murder without alarm and
discovery. It is more likely that she was decoyed
into some of the retreats of infamy in this city,
places of surer concealment than any to be found
at Hoboken, that she was there violated and mur-
dered, her body thrown into the river, and after-
wards washed to the Hoboken shore. The testi-
mony given at the Coroner's inquest, the whole of
which is not of a nature to publish, establishes, in
the strongest manner, the purity of the girl's char-
acter, and adds to the horror of the deed which
has been committed. We find the following para-
graph in the Express of this morning:
   A<small>RREST ON</small> S<small>USPICION OF</small> M<small>URDER</small>.—A young
sea faring man, belonging to one of the United
States vessels here, was yesterday arrested and ta-

examination, touching his participating in, or
knowledge of the death, by murder, of Mary Ceci-
lia Rogers. He was a former acquaintance of the
young lady, and was supposed to be person
who was seen in her company on the afternoon of
her death. Two gentlemen who had seen the lat-
ter, on seeing the prisoner, said at once he was not
the man—and after a long and critical examination
by the magistrate he was discharged, to return on
board his ship. The affair is still enveloped in
mystery; but the officers, or some of them at least,
are continually on the alert to discover and arrest
the murderer if possible. It is understood that
Governor Pennington is about to offer a reward for
the discovery and arrest of the murderer.

in relation to the female who was for several days on board

ten miles from Glasgow, Scotland, and according to her own
account, was treated so harshly by a step-father that she de-
termined at any and every risk to leave the country. She
started from home with but little money and few clothes.
The latter she sold and obtained a boy's suit. She was in
Liverpool several days looking out for a vessel, and during
the whole time readily <u title="succeeded">succeeeded</u> in deceiving those with
whom she came in contact as to her true character. She
got on board the Algonquin without the knowledge of her
officers, and did not make her appearance until the vessel
was fully under way. She then presented herself, and said
she had been a drummer in a Scotch regiment, and was treat-
ed with such severity that she determined to make her escape.
For the first few days she mingled freely with the sailors,
and once or twice slept in a berth with one without the slight-
est suspicion on his part as to the sex of his companion. In-
deed, she is described as decorous in her manner, modest in
her deportment, and exceedingly anxious to avoid any thing
improper, either in language or in action. At home, she
was employed as a housemaid at a shilling per week. Sev-
eral persons who have conversed with her, state that the im-
pression made by her answers and deportment was quite fa-
vorable. She is not handsome, but has a healthy appear-
ance, with a frank, good-humored face. No love story is
connected with her adventure. She has already obtained
employment in a respectable family in this city, and appears
delighted with her situation. On shipboard she went aloft
several times, and was nimble, active and fearless. She had
no clothes whatever but the dress she wore. Capt. Turley's
conduct to her, while on board, was humane and praisewor-
thy throughout.			[Philadelphia Inquirer.</f>

	<b style="font-size:120%;letter-spacing:.15em">IMPRISONMENT OF VAGRANTS.</b>
		OPINION OF THE COURT OF SESSIONS.
   The summary Imprisonment of dissolute and vicious per-
sons by our Police Justices under a general charge of Va-
grancy had deservedly attracted much attention from the Bar
and the Public. On the one hand, it has been claimed as
necessary to the preservation of Morality and Order; on the
other, denounced as dangerous to personal liberty. It must
be obvious to all that such a process is liable to the grossest
abuses, and ought to be very carefully guarded; while, as a
prop to Public Morals, it seems to us exceedingly imper-
fect and unsafe one.
   A case of this kind came up before the Court of Sessions
yesterday, in which, after hearing, Judge L<small>YNCH</small> delivered
the Opinion of the Court, as follows:
<m9>   C<small>OURT OF</small> S<small>ESSIONS</small>—In the matter of <u title="'Matilda' in Herald-1841-08-14">Melinda</u> Hoag, on Habeas
Corpus. Opinion of Judge Lynch.
   The prisoner is brought before me on a Habeas Corpus directed to
the keeper of the City Prison, to which he has returned that he de-
tains her by virtue of a commitment which is in the words following:
   C<small>ITY AND</small> C<small>OUNTY OF</small> N<small>EW</small> Y<small>ORK, SS</small>.—By George W. Matsell, Esq.,
one of the Special Justices for preserving the peace in the City of
New-York, to the Constables and Marshals of the said City, and every
of them, and to the Keeper of the Penitentiary, of the City of New-
York: These are in the name of the People of the State of New-York
to command you, the said Constables and Marshals, to convoy to the
said Penitentiary the body of Melinda Hoag, who stands charged be-
fore me with being a vagrant, viz. an idle person and a common pros-
titute, who, not having visible means to maintain herself, lives
without lawful employment, and whereof she is convicted on
competent testimony. And you, the said Keeper, are hereby com-
manded to receive into custody, in the said Penitentiary, the body of
the said Melinda, and her safely keep for the space of six months, or
until she shall be thence delivered by our course of law.
Given under my hand and seal, this 20th day of July, in the year of
   our Lord one thousand eight hundred and forty-one.
		Copy.		(Signed)		GEO. W. MATSELL.
   The Counsel for the prisoner contends that the prisoner should be
discharged on the ground that the commitment is void for defects ap-
pearing on the face of it.
   1st. That the signature is by Geo. W. Matsell, without stating his
official capacity.
   2d. That the offence of which the prisoner is convicted is not stated
with sufficient precision, and is not within the terms of any statute
defining what constitutes a vagrant.
   3d. That there is no seal to the warrant, although it is stated that
it is under seal.
   4th. That it does not appear by the commitment whether it was
upon confession of the party or competent testimony, and that if on
the latter, the names of the witnesses and their testimony should have
been stated.
   5th. That there is no statement of any adjudication that the pri-
soner was an improper person to be sent to the Alms-House, or that
she was a notorious offender and not a proper object of relief.
   1. There is no force in the first objection. In the body of the com-
mitment George W. Matsell is described as one of the Special Justi-
ces for preserving the Peace in the City of New-York, which is a suf-
ficient allegation of his authority, and it was not necessary to affix to
his signature his official character.
   2. The offence stated in the commitment is that the prisoner is a
<i>vagrant</i> viz: “an idle person and a common prostitute, who, not hav-
ing visible means to maintain herself, lives without lawful employ-
ment.” As the Justice has undertaken to define in the warrant the
particular species of vagrancy of which the prisoner was convicted,
it must appear to be one of the cases which is specified by the statute,
and if it appears that it is not with any of the cases so specified, not
only the commitment but the conviction itself would be void. By the
Revised Statutes, Sec. 1st, Tit. 2d of chap. 20 of part 1st, “all idle
persons who not having visible means to maintain themselves, live
without employment,” are declared to be vagrants, and after con-
viction may be committed to the Alms-House for a term not exceed-
ing 6 months, or to the Bridewell for a term not exceeding 60 days.
   By the 3rd sec. of the act relative to the powers of the Common
Council of the City of New-York and the Police and Criminal Courts
of the said City, passed 1838, it is declared that “all common prosti-
tutes who have no lawful employment whereby to maintain them-
selves, are vagrants,” and may, upon conviction, be committed, if not
a notorious offender, and be a proper object for such relief to the
Alms-House of said City for a term not exceeding six months, or if
an improper person to be sent to the Alms-House, then such person
shall be committed for the like time to the Penitentiary of said City.
   It is obvious that the offence charged is made up partly of a charge
under one and partly under the other of these laws, and if it could
be allowed as contended for by the District Attorney to reject any
part of the description of the offence, (which I very much doubt,)
still there would be an insuperable difficulty in the way of supporting
this commitment. If we should reject the words, “and a common
prostitute,” the offence described would come within the description
of the act in the Revised Statutes above referred to; but as that
Statute prescribes a punishment of sixty days only in the Peniten-
tiary, and this commitment directs an imprisonment of six months—
the commitment is clearly void under that Statute. On the other hand,
if we should reject as surplusage the words “an idle person” and
“not having visible means to maintain herself” so that it would read
“a common prostitute who lives without employment” it is essential-
ly different from the words in the Statute of 1833, which are “a com-
mon prostitute <i>who has no lawful employment whereby to maintain
herself</i>.” Now a common prostitute who lives without employment,
but who <i>has</i> means to maintain herself, is clearly not within this
Statute, and therefore the description of the offence is uncertain and
does not correspond with the description of vagrancy in any Statute,
and the commitment is bad.
   3. The objection of the want of a seal is not well taken. The sta-
tute only requires that the commitment should be under the <i>hand</i> of
the magistrate, and the words “and seal” may be rejected as surplus-
age.
   It is not necessary in a <i>commitment</i> of this kind to state the evi-
dence of the facts in detail, or the names of the witnesses, although
it is indispensably necessary to be inserted in the record of convic-
tion. It is sufficient if the offence is described with certainty in the
commitment, and that the party has been convicted by a person hav-
ing authority for that purpose. 12 East. 69 82.
   There is one other objection which I consider fatal as to the va-
lidity of this commitment.
   If the prisoner was regularly convicted as a vagrant, the punishment
to be inflicted is in the alternative, if she is not a notorious offender,
&c. she is to be sent to the Alms-House, otherwise to the Penitentia-
ry. It is well settled that where imprisonment is inflicted by the
statute as an alternative punishment, or where there is a discretion to
commit either to one place at hard labor for a time not exceeding a
particular period, or to another place for the like time, the commit-
ment ought to notice that fact, 1 Lord Raymond, 545; Paley on con-
victions, 189. And in a case in 2d Burrow's Reports, 1165, the Court
lay down the rule emphatically that where the commitment is discre-
tionary as to length of time or as to place, there must be an adjudi-
cation by the magistrate as to the time and the place, and because
there was no adjudication on that point the conviction was quashed.
The Court said it was a conviction without a judgement. The time
and the duration of the commitment ought to be ascertained upon the
conviction. A conviction is equal to a verdict and judgement. But
this is a verdict without a judgement. The objection taken by the
Counsel for the prisoner on this ground is well taken.
   An examination of the proceedings in the Police Court in this
case, as well as some experience in other cases, has satisfied me that
an idea prevails that in the administration of justice in inferior tribu-
nals, and in cases of the lesser grades of crime, it is only necessary to
have in view the substantial end of justice, and that a regard to forms
is not essential. This I consider to be a radical error. The power of
a Justice to commit a person to prison upon conviction without the
intervention of a jury, is a power which ought to be exercised with
great caution and prudence; it is one which is liable to all the abuse
growing out of an ignorance of duty on the part of the Magistrate—
out of prejudice or personal dislike, or out of interested motives, and
is ought to be sedulously watched by requiring a strict adherence to
those forms of law which have been wisely provided to guard against
those abuses. This exception to the right of trial by jury is founded
only upon the necessity of the case, is intended rather to provide for
the wants or necessities of the Vagrant than as a punishment, and
uses punishment only so far as it is necessary to compel the idle and
dissipated to provide for their own maintenance. The forms of law
make it necessary that the Magistrate should enter in the Record of
Conviction the testimony and the names of the witnesses, so that it
may appear when the record should be submitted for review to the
tribunal which has power to control it, whether the offence proved is
within the jurisdiction of the Magistrate, and to provide the means
of holding the Magistrate responsible for the correct discharge of his
duty.
   We live in a country which has been remarkable for the respect
which is paid to the due and proper administration of justice; and so
long as the law is purely administered and magistrates conform to the
provisions of the law, and keep within the line of their duties, and
submit to the decisions made by the duly constituted authorities, a re-
liance on the virtue and good sense of the people induces the belief
that the same respect will continue to be paid; but if magistrates
choose to make rules for themselves, to depart from the rules settled
for their government, and to set up their own constructions of the
law in opposition to the law as legitimately declared and expounded,
it presents an example and forms an excuse to the depraved to set
the laws at defiance, and would lead to the most disastrous conse-
quences.
   The proper forms are to be found in books of established prece-
dents, and I have no doubts that, if the arduous duties of the District
Attorney will permit, he would cheerfully give such advice as would
enable the magistrates in the Police Office to adopt proper forms, and
enable them to perform their duties in a manner which will be free
from objection.
   The commitment in this case being void for the reasons I have sta-
ted, I order that the prisoner be discharged from custody thereon, and
direct the Keeper of the City Prison to discharge her accordingly.</m9>

<b>The Outrage on Mary C. Rogers, and similar
   Attacks in other places—A Public Meet-
   ing.</b>
   We copy the following account of an outrageous
attack on a Baltimore lady from a Philadelphia pa-
per:—
<m9>   “We are informed,” says the Baltimore Clipper, “by
the watchman of the neighborhood, that on Monday night
last a gentleman called upon him for aid under the follow-
ing circumstances:—The gentleman, accompanied by a
lady, was walking in the vicinity of the infirmary about
nine o'clock, when they were instantly surrounded by
eight or ten young men, some of whom beat him conside-
rably, whilst others forcibly bore the young lady off. He
hastened for the watchman, and on returning, neither the
lady nor the ruffians could be found.”
   “This,” adds the Clipper, “is the second outrage of the
kind that has been perpetrated in our city within a few
days and the <u title="villains">villians</u>, in both instances, have thus far es-
caped detection. From the lawless disposition which has
thus been exhibited, and the perfect impunity with which
crime is committed, it will become dangerous for ladies
to appear in our streets after dark, even when accompa-
nied by gentlemen.”</m9>
   Can this outrage throw any light on the murder of
Mary Rogers? A fortnight has now elapsed, since
the perpetration of one of the most daring and mur-
derous outrages ever perpetrated in a community call-
ing itself civilized. Yet we hear of no clue arrived at,
and but very little exertion made for the discovery
and punishment of the brutal ravishers and murder-
ers. The apathy of the people of this city, in some
cases, is most remarkable. If a great robbery, or a
bare-faced forgery is perpetrated, we find plenty of
people ready to pursue and capture the offender. If
a petty theft is effected, the indignation of the Court
of Sessions is aroused, and should it be a piece of
pork or some old clo', that are stolen, the poor, hun-
gry, half-starved mortal is brought up to the Special
Sessions, and sent to dig stone—but if a human be-
ing is suddenly and ruthlessly severed from the
thread of existence, we see the ministers of Justice
stand with their arms folded, waiting for a price to
be bid for their exertions ere they will start on the
trail of the murderers. Such a system offers an im-
punity to the rich ruffian, it holds a shield over the
<u>violater</u> of female virtue, and in but too many cases,
acts as the stimulant to outrages at which human-
ity shudders.
   It is in vain to call upon the ministers of justice to
step in and stay the plague which is at our doors,
and the community—at least the virtuous portion—
must act for themselves. Let a public meeting be
set a foot, a subscription raised in order to offer a
reward for the murderers of Mary Rogers. We will
give <small>FIFTY DOLLARS</small>; and we doubt not that in less
then 24 hours a thousand dollars may be raised, to be
paid into the hands of the Mayor of New York, for
the purpose of stimulating the energetic and <u title="indefatigable">inde-
fatigible</u> police of this—the commercial and intel-
lectual emporium of these United States.
   If this course is not pursued, no woman will be
safe, even under the protection of a husband or brother.
For other attacks have since come to our knowledge
and although the fellows did not in all the instances
succeed in their brutal object, or take the life of
their victim, still it is evident that nothing but fear
saved them from the guilt of a capital crime. At
Brooklyn, a married lady was seized by a gang
of ruffians and violated. On Coney Island Beach,
two sisters, while bathing were attacked by a
brawny rascal, and but for the nerve and courage dis-
played by the younger of the girls, the brute would
have accomplished his purpose. In Philadelphia
and Baltimore, similar outrages have been attempt-
ed, as will be seen by the extract attached to this
article. About ten days since, a young lady was
violated in the open day light in one of the public
parks of the latter city, in the presence of several
respectable citizens who were unable to save the
daughter of a neighbor from the loathsome contami-
nation of a herd of wretches who are a disgrace to
humanity.
   Let us, therefore, have a public meeting—a volun-
tary effort, to give dignity and force to the admin-
istration of justice. It is time—full time. Here are
our criminal judges making a great noise about petty
offenders—presenting in a breath all the “lower
classes”—but silently skipping over those dens of
assignation, frequented by the respectable classes—
and where it is probable that Mary Rogers was for-
cibly taken—forcibly violated—then murdered to
conceal the crime—and her body consigned to the
Hudson to bury the whole in the deep sea waves.
Yes, on every hand our criminal judges are assailing
the liberty of the press—and getting up indictments
on frivolous pretences, while the liberty, the life, the
virtue of an industrious and respectable young wo-
man, furnishes the staple of no charge to a Grand
Jury—does not excite the slightest attention in the
bosom of the tender-hearted Judge, that talks so
much of duty, character, virtue, and public order.
Out upon hypocrites in high places! Let the people
meet at once in the Park, and get up a subscription
that will make the officers of justice bestir them-
selves. Eight per cent. on the value of a human
life will surely call forth some Bill Wiley, as did the
like percentage in the case of Frederick County
Bank. Really—really, the newspapers are becom-
ing the only efficient police, the only efficient judges
that we have.

   ☞ H<small>OBOKEN FOR EVER</small>.—We have already asserted
that a trip to Hoboken is preferable to any other place,
because there is no need of walking two miles under a
scorching sun in order to find a resting place and a cool

clay, Canal, or Christopher streets, and after having
sailed across to beautiful Hoboken, in three minutes you
arrive at the pleasant, shaded Hoboken house, kept by

		[FOR THE SUN.]
   M<small>R</small>. E<small>DITOR</small>—I was at Hoboken the afternoon
that the murdered body of Miss Rodgers lay upon
the beach, and saw it before the jury of inquest
was held, and am surprised that these is so much
mystery about it, and that even the plain story
has never been laid before the public.
   Upon enquiring of a man who keeps an oyster
stand near the dock bridge, at the Elysian Fields,
he replied that the young lady went out in a small
boat, with a gentleman, his wife, and daughter,
the Sunday previous, and while out in the river
another small boat, with seven men in it, came
alongside, and took her into their boat by force;
and that he (the oysterman) and his child were on
the dock bridge in the evening, and with others
distinctly heard her cries, which the men in the
boat tried to drown by singing and carousing.—
The oysterman stated, also, that persons who
heard her cries wanted to go out to her rescue,
but there was not a small boat about that could be
got.
   Now, who is this gentleman with his wife and
daughter? And why is not this part of the story
published? (as I presume it was told to any others
who enquired.) And why is not a sufficient re-
ward offered for information that might lead to
the discovery of the murderers?
				A<small>NTI</small>-M<small>YSTERY</small>.
   We know not who is the writer of the foregoing,
and consequently cannot say to what degree of
credence it may be entitled. If true, its publica-
tion is all important; and we give it as it was giv-
en to us, in the hope that it may tend to draw the
facts of the fatal mystery to light—[E<small>DS</small>. S<small>UN</small>.<a id="Sun-1841-08-10-TDW"></a>
   ☞ Since the foregoing was in type, yester-
day's Evening Tattler appeared with a communi-
cation, and remarks by the Editor, from which it
appears that the two gentlemen spoken of by his
correspondent were a Mr. Fanshaw and a Mr.
Thomas—the former a brother, the latter a son-in-
law of Mr. Daniel Fanshaw; and that they fully
corroborate the statement of “T. D. W.,” which is
as follows:
T<small>O THE</small> E<small>DITORS OF THE</small> T<small>ATTLER</small>:
   Gentlemen,—If you consider what I am about
to communicate worth publishing it is at your ser-
vice. I have declined coming forward through mo-
tives of a, perhaps criminal, prudence and even
now I dare not reveal my name, because I fear
that by doing so I might become the victim of a
gang, who are all powerful to revenge any injury
that may be done to any members of their body—
such a gang, for instance, as went such lengths for
the release of Ezra White, from an apprehension
that if he came to the gallows he might implicate
many of themselves, in his “dying confessions.”
If you doubt the authenticity of my letter, or sup-
pose it to be a hoax, please keep possession of it,
and advertise for the two gentlemen alluded to in
it, to come forward—who, if they are not also too
fearful of the gang to make themselves known—
will probably call on you and corroborate the fol-
lowing statement:
   On Sunday, the 25th of July, I was sauntering
towards evening on the banks at Hoboken. My
attention was suddenly arrested by a boat rushing
across the Hudson from New York, at great speed;
and when it neared the land, I perceived that there
were in the boat six men, and <i>one young well dress-
ed female</i>, whom I feel confident, from description,
as also from a dim recollection of my own, was
the Cigar Girl. Immediately as they touched the
strand, the six men and the female left the boat
and proceeded towards the woods. I then noticed
that the men were of that class denominated
“rowdies”—such men, for instance, as hang
about the doors of low gaming public houses, wear
flat-brimmed hats, and affect an air of vulgar de-
vil-may-care gentility. At this time I observed
two gentlemen conversing a short distance off.—
These gentlemen also noticed the boat, and I
think from their gestures, made some remarks
about the people that were in it.
   Be this as it may, two of the boatmen lingered
behind and spoke to these gentlemen, for the
purpose, probably, of diverting their attention
from the road the others with the female took;—
and then these two likewise proceeded at a sharp
pace for the woods. I cannot say that the female
made any opposition—I rather think she did not,
or I would have observed it—but at all events she
was there.
   Scarcely had this party passed out of sight, than
another boat came sweeping over the river. This
had three men in it, and when they landed, they
jumped from the boat with great rapidity, and
looked eagerly about them, as if in quest of some
object. The gentlemen I have alluded to before
being nearest these men, one of them asked him<!-- Some text is better visible in Herald-1841-08-12 & Rutland-Herald-1841-08-17 -->
if they had seen a female and several men landing
from a boat? The gentlemen replied in the affir-
mative. “Did you observe,” asked the same man,
“if they used any violence with her?” The <u>gen-
tlemen</u> answered “no.” And then the boatmen
being informed of the route the first party took,
followed after at a rapid stride—almost a run.
   The above is all I know about this affair, but I
am firmly persuaded in my own mind, that the
young lady brought over in the first boat was the
“cigar girl” who was so brutally murdered a few
hours afterwards. I wonder the two gentlemen
have not made their experience in this matter
public, for I am sure that they must entertain the
same suspicions that I do. Yours, T. D. W.

   ☞ There is a circumstantial account in the last Evening

Sunday, July 25th, in company with five young men, while
three more young men landed from another boat soon after,
and inquired for the former party, and also if any <i>violence</i>
had been offered to the girl. They then followed the direc-
tion of the other party.—The inference which alone gives this
story any consequence is that the girl was <i>Mary C. Rogers</i>.
But we have made inquiries, and ascertained to our satisfac-
tion that the woman so seen was <i>not</i> Miss Rogers, but a com-
mon creature of the town, who had been taken out of the
boat of the weaker by the stronger party. It must be ob-

conveyed unless by force, and certainly not without outcry
past several persons who would have aided her rescue.

   We have received a communication, signed
“Chirurgicus” on the subject of “the disgraceful
and unprofessional exhibitions at the Stuyvesant
Institute” and though we fully agree with every
observation of the writer, we cannot publish it
entire, many of his remarks having allusion to an
individual and to a press, so vile and base, that it
is with the utmost repugnance we bring ourselves to
notice either the one or the other. The exhibitions
themselves, our correspondent may rely, will become
objects of disgust not with the profession alone, but
with the whole community: and those who have got
them up, will soon be classed with the traveling
mountebanks, who infest with their booths the fairs
and market places of Europe, and exhibit to the gaping
multitude, the horrid spectacle of human nature suf-
fering under afflictions, which their wondrous skill
alone can cure. Were charity the aim, would it not
be better exercised in private? Were it to impart
surgical skill; is not the secluded room the proper
place, the student alone being spectator. Never be-
fore, that we know of, have regular bred physicians
or surgeons, sought to obtain notoriety, by tricks
which only come within the domain of the charlatan.
   We annex the concluding part of the communica-
tion as it is addressed to one who all respect and who
should not suffer his name and fame to be thus pros-
tituted.—[E<small>DITOR </small>C & E.
   The profession have seen with disgust, this man
[the Herald reporter] prominent among the most fa-
vored guests. He however, appears quite among his
friends, has his joke with one Professor, and grasps
another by the hand.—They assist him in taking
notes. All this degradation is submitted to—for
what? That the University may be lauded in the
same columns with <u>Madam</u> R<small>ESTELL</small>. Among these
Professors there is one of whom his brethren expect-
ed better things. Can it be that the associate of
H<small>OSACK</small>, and P<small>OST</small>, and McN<small>EVEN</small>, and M<small>ITCHELL</small>,
can consent to play hail-fellow-well-met, with such
a vagabond, and all to be puffed in <u>Madam</u> R<small>ESTELL</small>'s
organ? I know he seeks to excuse himself by say-
ing—“I had nothing to do with it!” “I know nothing
about it.” This excuse however, will not avail. He
is art and part, and will be so considered—without
his name the whole fabric of <i>quackery</i> would fall to
the ground. The profession look <i>to him</i>. Of his as-
sociates, as he well knows, they know little and care
less—but <i>to him</i> they look to elevate the standard of
professional character.
   Does he not feel that his fame must be tarnished
and his name soiled by being dragged through the
receptacle of filth and blackguardism, to which I
have alluded? Let him be assured, that if he does
not feel this, the profession do—and they will resent
it. Especially, will this be done by the junior por-
tion of the profession, whose proud aspirations in re-
gard to the future standing of the profession he is so
cruelly sacrificing.		CHIRURGICUS.

			POLICE—Monday.
	...
   One of the evening papers of yesterday mentions
the fact that two gentlemen, Messrs. Fanshaw and
Thomas, on the 25th ult. were witnesses to a circum-
stance which may possibly shed some light on the
deep mystery that now hangs round the fate of Mary
C. Rogers. It is there stated that on Sunday, the
25th, while at Hoboken, they saw a boat containing
six men and one female, all of whom as soon as they
landed at Hoboken, left the boat and started for the
woods. Soon afterwards another boat landed there,
rowed by three men, one of whom asked one of the
above named gentlemen if he had seen a boat with
the six men and a girl in it, and on receiving an affir-
mative reply, he asked if any violence had been of-
fered, to which he answered they had not. The
three last named men then started off apparently in
great haste in pursuit of the men with the young fe-
male.
   This may or may not be the unfortunate girl, whose
fate has created such deep excitement, but at all
events, it is to be hoped that the above statement
(taken from the Tattler,) may be traced out, and if
indeed it was the hapless Mary C. Rogers, there may
<s>be some hope that her murderers will be brought to</s>
justice. We have not heard of any steps taken by
the Police in the matter.

   T<small>HE</small> M<small>URDERED</small> M<small>ARY</small> R<small>OGERS</small>.—Nothing has yet
been found out definitely in relation to this murder;
which was even a far more horrible affair than the
murder of Miss Sands. As far as we know, there
has not even been a reward offered by the authorities
of this city or New Jersey. The whole thing—the
entire proceedings—commencing with the finding
of the body, the inquest, &c., in their manner, have
been most disgraceful. What are our criminal au-
thorities about? It really appears that since the pas-
sage of the new criminal court law, by which so
much milk and water and folly has been infused in-
to the bench, that the true administration of public
justice is shamefully neglected. The police judges
say that as fast as they act in certain cases for the
public good, some one or other of the other judges
of the criminal court undo all they have done; the
two branches of criminal justice are thus made to
war against each other, and in this way we suppose
murders and robberies and outrages of the most hor-
rible kind are perpetrated, and no one is punished or
even arrested therefor. How long is that sad state
of things to continue? How much has Gov. Sew-
ard to answer for, in thus disorganizing our criminal
court, which, when composed of Robert H. Morris,
two Aldermen, and James R. Whiting, was the
most honest and efficient criminal court in the coun-
try. We yet hope that the citizens will take this
matter up, and call a meeting in the Park or else-
where, and subscribe a reward for the detection of
the murderer of Mary Rogers. We do not believe
the story that she was taken out of a boat in the ri-
ver. We have heard that a female was taken out of
a boat on the river on that day or the day after, from
her own father, but that she was not Mary Rogers.
Dr. Cook says that almost every thing thrown into
the North River, near the Battery, floats over to Ho-
boken, and therefore thinks she was murdered in this
city and thrown into the river. We hardly think
this; and A. M. C. Smith says that one or two gen-
tlemen saw Mary Rogers sitting on a bench at Ho-
boken, late on Sunday afternoon, with a young man,
and that they were quarrelling severely. The whole
thing has been most miserably mismanaged. Let
us subscribe for a reward at once.

   T<small>HE</small> H<small>OBOKEN</small> M<small>URDER</small>.—Nothing has transpired at the
Police office worth detailing to our readers on this me-
lancholy subject, notwithstanding the many stories
which are daily dished up for those who like to sup full
of horrors. The young sailor, who was arrested last
week, <i>is staying in the Tombs</i>, at his own request. He says,
that he shall be looked upon as a suspected person if he
goes, as he might, on board the North Carolina, and that
he wishes to remain in custody until the authorities are
fully satisfied of his innocence. We believe that one of
the Magistrates was out all yesterday, in company with
an officer, and that they both returned without obtaining
any clue to the murderers. It is still the prevailing opin-
ion that the deed was effected in this city, and that the
parties immediately fled, leaving no trace of their where-
abouts; and when it is considered that three days elap-
sed before the body was found, and six before any excite-
ment was raised at the atrocity, we <u>thing</u> it is not surpri-
sing that no discovery has been made.

		<i>From the New-York Express</i>.
	AN ATROCIOUS MURDER.
   The murder of the unfortunate girl, Mary
<u>Cecelia</u> Rogers, noticed in another part of
our paper is of such an atrocious character
as to demand that it be taken forth from the
ordinary police Reports to be made a matter
of especial attention, in order, if possible to
arouse inquiry as to the murderers. This
girl has been seen by most persons who have
walked by the Cigar store of Anderson in
Broadway, where she was somewhat con-
spicuous as a vender of Cigars, whence she
obtained the <i>sobriquet</i> of “the Cigar girl.”
This girl was missed by her friends for
some days, who advertised for her at last in
the public prints, but on <u>Thursday</u> last, her
body was found in the water near Hoboken,
by some persons passing in a sail boat. The
discovery of the body bearing evident marks
of violence, aroused inquiry, and the Coro-
ner's Jury, while they bore testimony to her
general good character, also came to the
conclusion that she was murdered.
   Nothing as yet is certainly known of the
manner of her death. According to the New
Era, she was crossing the river to Hoboken
in a small boat with a young man who was
paying her honorable attention, and that hav-
ing proceeded half way over, another boat
in which were 5 complete rowdies and soap-
locks came alongside, and who forced her
into the boat and pushed off, up the river,
and when an opportunity presented, and they
were concealed, as they imagined from ob-
servation, violated her person and afterwards
to prevent their infamous and diabolical acts
from coming to light, threw the unfortunate
victim of their nefarious and unruly passions
overboard.
   The Courier well remarks, it seems in-
credible that men could deliberately plan
and commit a murder for such a motive, yet
the facts inevitably lead to the conclusion,
that this is one of those unnatural instances
of horrid crime, which sets all reason at de-
fiance. Ten days have now elapsed since
its commission; hitherto the tracks of its fe-
rocious perpetrators have not been discover-
ed, and the blood of the hapless female will
probably pass unrevenged, unless the public
authorities evince more than ordinary activ-
ity.

		MARY C. ROGERS
   The murder of this young and beautiful girl, con-
nected as is supposed with the brutal violation of her
person, has created great excitement in the city of New
York.
   This girl was missed by her friends for some days,
who advertised for her at last in the public prints, but
on <u>Thursday</u> last, her body was found in the water near
Hoboken, by some persons passing in a sail boat. The
discovery of the body bearing evident marks of vio-
lence, aroused inquiry, and the Coroner's Jury, while
they bore testimony to her general good character, al-
so came to the conclusion that she had been robbed of
her chastity, and then murdered to conceal the crime.
The examination of persons suspected has as yet elic-
ited nothing that will reveal the mystery of her death.

<h2>A Victim of Lust on the Broad Hudson</h2>

   T<small>HE</small> M<small>URDER OF</small> M<small>ARY</small> C. R<small>OGERS</small>.—Is there to
be no extraordinary incentive offered to stimulate to
the discovery of the authors of this atrocious crime?
Do the authorities of the city where she belonged,
and whence she was probably decoyed, feel no obli-
gation to offer a reward for the detection of the ruf-
fian murderers? Should not the State Executive
issue his proclamation of reward, and pardon, if ne-
cessary, to any accomplice that shall convict the real
criminal?
   We have seen something of these authorities wait-
ing for the action of New Jersey. But why so? It
may well be that the Governor of New Jersey
hesitates about staining the annals of his State with
a proclamation implying that a crime so atrocious
was perpetrated by its citizens or within its borders.
But whether or not she was from New York, the
body was found within the jurisdiction of New York,
which extends for purposes of police and legal service
to low water mark on the Jersey shore, and, more-
over, the more probable conjecture, it seems to us,
is, that this unfortunate victim of unbridled lust was
decoyed into a boat, and that there, on the broad
Hudson, and out of the reach of succor, the crime
was perpetrated, and the body loaded with stones,
thrown over to be sunk, as the murderers (for there
must have been more than one) probably hoped, for-
ever, from the reach of human eye.
   We call, therefore, upon the Common Council—
we call upon the Executive of the State, to be stir-
ring in this bloody business, which cries to Heaven
for vengeance.

   M<small>URDER</small> M<small>OST</small> F<small>OUL</small>.—Miss Mary C. Rogers, of
New-York, well known in town and country as
“the beautiful cigar girl” when attending the To-
bacco Store of John Anderson in Broadway, left
her house No. 126 Nassau street for a walk on
Sunday morning, the 25th ultimo. Shortly after,
she was accosted by a young man, apparently an
acquaintance, with whom it is supposed she went
on an excursion to Hoboken. She did not return,
and on Tuesday her friends alarmed at her pro-
tracted absence, advertised her in the papers of that
day. On Wednesday, two men as they were pass-
ing the Sybil's Cave, near Castle Point, Hoboken,
discovered the body of a woman in the water,
which they anchored by a weight until the Coroner
could be notified, when an inquest was held and
the body was proved to be that of Miss Rogers.—
It bore the marks of violence and it was evident
that her person had been horribly outraged before
she was murdered. The inquest returned a verdict
of “murder by some person or persons unknown.”
   Several persons have been arrested and examined,
but as yet, nothing has been elicited by which the
perpetrator or perpetrators of this foul deed can be
identified. The deceased bore an excellent charac-
ter, and was the main support of a widowed mo-
ther.

within our knowledge, from the Louisville, (Miss.)
Tablet, of the <u title="'29' in Mohawk Courier, '24' in Tribune">24th</u> ult.
   “One of the most awful deeds that has perhaps
ever come within our knowledge of the human race,
was perpetrated in the vicinity of this place, on Sun-

cidate the mystery hanging over the murder of poor
Mary has yet transpired at the Police Office. <i>On dits</i> and
stories, made to suit the <u title="gullibility">gullibillity</u> of the gaping crowd,
there are to be picked up easily enough, but, on enquiry,
they are all found to be like the baseless fabric of
a vision. One fact has come to our knowledge.
Several anonymous letters have been received, all
written in a very neat female hand, pointing out a
young gentleman well known as a sort of genteel
loafer at the theatres, and a frequenter of gambling hou-
ses and other places of public resort, as having been seen
with Mary sitting on a rock—on the other side of the
North River on the fatal Sunday afternoon. We do not
think these letters likely to lead to any discovery, for
the person whom they point at has been guilty of pursu-
ing his usual avocations down town ever since. They
are most likely written by some fair intrigante whom
the party has piqued or made jealous. The Police have
their eye, of course, on the individual, and if he were to
leave the city suddenly he might find himself—in cus-
tody.

   T<small>HE</small> L<small>ATE</small> M<small>URDER</small>.—One of the most singular
scenes in the administration of criminal justice in
this city is to see Judge Noah and Judge Lynch, en-
deavoring to assume the greatest gravity imaginable
in sentencing poor miserable creatures to Blackwell's
Island for six months, for stealing a few pounds of
pork,—no, not pork—beef, an old coat, and old hat,
an old pair of breeches, for blacking an eye, or bruis-
ing another's head, or for stealing something to sus-
tain life, or to cover their nakedness. It is amusing
and yet sorrowful to see these things, and to contrast
them with the apathy exhibited by the adjudicators
of justice here, when a young, lovely and innocent
girl has been ruthlessly torn from the arms of her
mother, violated, murdered, and thrown into the
river. It seems as if we had nothing to hope from
justice; and therefore we hope the citizens will take
this matter in hand themselves.
   Singularly enough, since we penned the above,
we found the following in the “Star” of last eve-
ning:
<l9>   All parties, however much they may differ in other
matters, are determined on the reorganization of the
police. Our safety requires it; and he who opposes
this determination, belong to what party he may,
cannot be a candidate, with any hope of success, for
either the Legislature or Common Council. All the
discreet and respectable part of this city will sacri-
fice all considerations to the safety and well being of
this community. Every friend of law and religion
will give his efficient aid to reform the criminal law
and the police, <i>and to place Judges on the bench compe-
tent to the discharge of their duties</i>.</l9>
  Very well; this is what we want; this is what we
are contending for; and singularly enough, have
been indicted because we contend for it.

New Jersey, to detect the murderers of Mary C. Rogers,
and deeming this matter to be one of the utmost mo-
ment to every parent, husband, and brother, in this com-
munity, do hereby call a primary meeting of their fellow
citizens, to be held at the house of James C. Stoneall, 29
Ann street, on Wednesday, the 11th day of August, 1841,
at eight o'clock in the evening, for the purpose of adopt-
ing such preparatory measures as may be deemed ne-
cessary to bring the perpetrators of the murder to speedy
punishment.

   We have very little to say in addition to the above.
The call of this meeting has been got up in a hurry,
because the nature of the case seemed to require
speedy action. Mr. Aaron Clark has been waited
upon in connection with this matter, and the follow-
ing are his remarks in relation thereto. Mr. Clark
will, however, subscribe to a reward:
<m9>   I am clearly of opinion that the murder of Mary C. Ro-
gers justifies and requires that a suitable reward should
be offered by the proper authority in this city for the ap-
prehension of the perpetrators.		AARON CLARK.

   We have only to add a request that all our fel-
low citizens, who can do so, <i> will attend the meeting
at Mr. Stoneall's,</i> 29 <i>Ann st. to-night!</i> We will give
$50 ourselves towards convicting the murderers;
and, already, with the above names, there are $200
subscribed for this purpose. We call upon Mayor
Morris to move in this matter. What is Governor
Seward doing?

   “One on the most awful deeds that has perhaps ever come
within the knowledge of the human race was perpetrated in
the vicinity of this place on Sunday morning last, by a Mrs.
Roper. <i>She killed three of her own children by cutting
their heads off with an axe</i>. From the information which
we have received on the subject, it seems to have been done
while she was in a fit of mental derangement. It was her
intention to have killed two more in the same manner, and
afterwards hang herself with a hank of yarn, but her husband
waking up, discovered something extraordinary in her actions
and seized her around the waist. After a strong effort on her
part to escape from him, during which she tried to draw one
of three knives from the ceiling, which she had previously
sharpened and put there, they reached the door, when he dis-
covered what she had been doing.
   “She is the mother of eleven children, including the three
which she killed. She appears now to be restored to reason,
and is pitiable spectacle of the deepest and most bitter an-
guish. She says that while under the influence of a distorted
imagination, she thought she was doing a charitable action in
ridding her husband of the burthen of supporting herself and
their five youngest children, as he is a poor and very hard-
working man.”</f>

	THE MURDER OF MISS ROGERS.
			——
	[From the New-York Journal of Commerce.]
   The public mind continues agitated, as well it
may be, on account of the dreadful crimes perpe-
trated, about a fortnight since, upon the person of
Miss Mary Cecilia Rogers, often spoken of as the
“pretty segar girl,”—she having been employed
by Mr. Anderson, a segar dealer in Broadway, to
attend his shop. For a year or two previous to
her death, she, in connexion with her mother,
had kept a respectable boarding house in Nassau
street. It is generally admitted that she was a
girl of good character, and this adds to the mys-
tery of the circumstances connected with her
death. How such a girl could have been <u title="induced">indue-
ced</u> to accompany such a gang of ruffians; or how
they could have got possession of her person, and
compelled her to accompany them without giving
the alarm <u title="when">whe</u> within hail of other persons, it is
not easy to imagine.
   Several persons have been arrested, first and
last, on suspicion of having been concerned in the
affair, but no sufficient evidence appearing against
them, they were discharged. The circumstances
stated in the annexed letter from the Evening Tat-
tler, throw some light upon the transaction,—suf-
ficient, at least, to show that Miss Rogers was the
victim of a horrid conspiracy, in which several
persons were concerned, and that the murder was
committed at Hoboken, and not in this city as
some had conjectured.

   The two gentlemen alluded to in the above, are
William D. Fanshaw, (nephew of Daniel Fan-
shaw, printer to the American Bible and Tract
Societies,) and his brother-in-law, Mr Thomas.
We have called on Mr. Fanshaw, to ascertain the
correctness of the statements in the latter, and he
informs us that they are correct in every particu-
lar. From the clue thus furnished, it is to be ho-
ped that the perpetrators of this diabolical out-
rage and murder will yet be found out. Where
so many are in the secret, some one or more of
them are very liable to reveal it. Let the Police
be on the alert.

FURTHER PARTICULARS—PROBABLE TRACE
		OF THE MURDERERS.
	N<small>EW</small> Y<small>ORK</small>, Saturday, Aug. 7, 1841.
To the Editors of the Tattler:
   G<small>ENTLEMEN</small>.—If you consider what I am about
to communicate worth publishing, it is at your
service. I have declined coming forward through
motives of a, perhaps criminal, prudence, and even
now I dare not reveal my name, because I fear
that by doing so I might become the victim of a
gang, who are all powerful to revenge any injury
that may be done to any members of their body—
such a gang, for instance, as went such lengths for
the release of Ezra White, from an apprehension
that if he came to the gallows he might implicate
many of themselves, in his “dying confessions.”—
If you doubt the authenticity of my letter, or sup-
pose it to be a hoax, please keep possession of it,
and advertise for the two gentlemen alluded to in
it, to come forward—who, if they are not also too
fearful of the gang to make themselves known—
will probably call on you and corroborate the fol-
lowing statement:
   On Sunday, the 25th of July, I was sauntering
towards evening on the banks at Hoboken. My
attention was suddenly arrested by a boat rushing
across the Hudson, from New York, at great speed;
and when it neared the land, I perceived that there
were in the boat six men, and <i>one young well dres-
sed female</i>, whom I felt confident, from description,
as also from a dim recollection of my own, was the
C<small>IGAR</small> G<small>IRL</small>. Immediately as they touched the
strand, the six men and the female left the boat
and proceeded towards the woods. I then noticed
that the men were of that class denominated “row-
dies”—such men for instance as hang about the
doors of low gaming public houses, wear flat-brim-
med hats, and affect an air of vulgar devil may-
care gentility. At this time I observed two gentle-
men conversing a short distance off. These gentle-
men also noticed the boat, and I think from their
gestures, made some remarks about the people
that were in it.
   Be this as it may, two of the boatmen lingered
behind, and spoke to these gentlemen, for the pur-
pose, probably, of diverting their attention from
the road the others with the female took; and then
these two likewise proceeded at a sharp pace for
the woods. I cannot say that the female made any
opposition—I rather think she did not, or I would
have observed it—but at all events, she was there.
   Scarcely had this party passed out of sight, than
another boat came sweeping over the river. This
had three men in it, and when they landed they
jumped from the boat with great rapidity, and look-
ed eagerly about them as if in quest of some ob-
ject. The gentlemen I have alluded to before be-
ing nearest these men, one of them asked him if
they had seen a female and several men landing
from a boat? The gentleman replied in the affir-
mative. “Did you observe,” asked the same man,
“<small>IF THEY USED ANY VIOLENCE WITH HER</small>?” The
gentleman answered “No.” And then the boat-
men, being informed of the route the first party
took, followed after at a rapid stride—almost a run.
   The above is all I know of this affair, but I am
firmly persuaded in my own mind, that the young
lady brought over in the first boat was the <i>cigar
girl</i> who was so brutally murdered a few hours af-
terwards. I wonder the two gentlemen have not
made their experience in this matter public—for I
am sure that they must entertain the same suspi-
cions that I do.		Yours,		T. D. W.

	REMARKS—FURTHER PARTICULARS.
   When we first received the foregoing commu-
nication we gave but little credence to the state-
ments contained in it. On reflection however, not
being able to see that the writer could have any ob-
ject in hoaxing us, we put all the force in our office
on the trail to see if we could not hunt up the “two
gentlemen.” All the evening of Saturday, how-
ever, they were unsuccessful—(or we should have
furnished the particulars to the Sunday papers, as
such important facts cannot be too early known or
widely <u title="disseminated">dissseminated</u>)—but this morning, when
we had almost come to the conclusion to throw the
letter by as an invention, we not only discovered
the fact that two gentlemen had seen the events de-
scribed by our informer, but had also the satisfac-
tion of learning their names. They are, Mr. Fan-
shaw—brother, we believe, of Mr. Daniel Fanshaw,
printer to the Bible Society—and his son-in-law,
Mr. Thomas, who is agent for Dr. Peters, the pro-
prietor of the celebrated Vegetable Pill. These
two gentlemen, we are informed, fully corroborate
the testimony furnished us by our correspondent,
and are likewise impressed with the idea that the
female they saw in the boat, and the “murdered ci-
gar girl,” may be one and the same person.
   Our hurry and anxiety to place these important
particulars before the public, left us no time to go
to quest of Mr. Fanshaw, or Mr. Thomas; but we
shall be much obliged to them if they will commu-
nicate with us on the subject, and correct us if we
have made any mistake.
   If the female and the boatmen spoken of above,
were the cigar girl and her murderers, which we
think more than probable, that diabolical affair will
soon come to light, as six or seven men cannot keep
so dreadful a secret. Some one will surely turn
evidence against the others. At all events, these
disclosures will give the police authorities a clue,
and we trust they may profit by it.

<d>[Col.2. A changed copy from <a href="#Courier-1841-08-05">Courier</a>]</d>
   <i>The Case of Mary C. Rogers</i>.—Notwith-
standing the vigorous efforts of the authori-
ties here and in New Jersey, we regret to
state that no clue has as yet been discovered
to the perpetrators of this dreadful tragedy.
The two young men who were arrested here
have been examined, and nothing being eli-
cited to warrant their detention, they were
discharged. Justice Merritt, of Hoboken,
caused a young man in Jersey City to be
arrested on suspicion, but after a protracted
examination he was discharged on Tuesday
night.
   Justice Merritt has addressed a letter to
Governor Pennington, of New Jersey, and
there is no doubt that he will offer a suitable
reward for the detection of the murderers.
Our Mayor is only waiting the action of Gov.
Pennington in the premises, as he conceives
that the first offer of a reward should come
from him.
   In a conversation with Dr. Cook, of Ho-
boken, we learned that the body of the un-
fortunate girl showed evident marks that the
most brutal violence had been restored to,
one of her wrists having been clasped so
tightly as to leave a mark as of a rope.—
There were besides other marks and bruises,
showing that the poor girl had fallen into the
hands of some worse than brutes. It is now
generally supposed that the deceased was
thrown from the cliff near the Sybil's Cave,
and that the marks on her face were not
made by fists, as was at first supposed, but
by coming in contact with the rocks in her
fall.
   Since writing the above, officers have ar-
rested a young man (whose name it is not
necessary to mention) on suspicion of being
concerned in the murder. He was examin-
ed, but immediately sent on board the U. S.
ship North Carolina, on board which ship he
enlisted the day the body was found, there
being no evidence to warrant his detention.

   Alfred <u>Cromeline</u> duly sworn, saith that he
recognises the deceased, and was well ac-
quainted with her—that her name is Mary
C. Rogers, a resident of No. 126, Nassau
street, New York—that he has known her for
a considerable time—having boarded in her
mother's house about six months, while de-
ceased was the officiating manager of the

and aged mother, with the whole charge of
conducting the boarding house.

   <i id="Corrector-1841-08-11-Friend-to-reform">The Murder of Mary C. Rogers</i>.—This
shocking affair has produced a great sensa-
tion in this city. Every one is enquiring how
it can be that a girl so well known as Mary
was, should have been conveyed to Hoboken
and murdered, and none have seen her.——
There is no doubt that several persons have
been concerned, and the impunity which
seems to attend the act, has stricken terror
into the inhabitants.
   What is the police doing—are they on the <i>qui
vive</i>, or are they waiting for the reward? If
any thing will convince the citizens of
the immediate necessity of a day police and
a new organization of the whole police es-
tablishment, the escape of the boy murderer,
and the murder of Mary Rogers, taken from
the very centre of our city, ought to con-
vince them. The police should be under the
direction of the best talent in the city. The
present plan is all wrong.

   T<small>HE</small> C<small>ASE OF</small> M<small>ARY</small> C. R<small>OGERS</small>.—Yesterday afternoon,
Mr. Daniel C. Payne, of 47 John-street, the young man to
whom the unfortunate Miss Rogers was engaged in mar-
riage, went to the Police Office, at the request of Justice Par-
ker, to state what information he might possess calculated to
throw light upon the mysterious disappearance and murder
of Miss R. The examination, which was long and tedious,
elicited nothing which is likely to lead to the detection of the
murderers. He states that on Sunday morning, about 10
o'clock, she called at his room and stated that she was going
to her cousin's, Mrs. Downing's, and should return in the
evening. She then left, apparently cheerful and lively as
usual. He did not go to see her in the evening, as it rained,
and the next morning her family was alarmed, and he went
in search of her, but found no tidings or trace of her till her
lifeless remains were discovered in the Hudson on the Wed-
nesday following.
   By order of the Acting Mayor, Purdy, her body was yes-
terday disinterred, in order that the deceased might be more
fully identified by some of the witnesses; but decomposition
had already taken place, and no trace of the once 'beautiful
cigar girl' could be recognized in the blackened and swollen
features.
   There is one point in Mr. Payne's testimony which is wor-
thy of remark. It seems he had been searching for Miss
Rogers—his betrothed—two or three days; yet when he was
informed on Wednesday evening that her body had been
found at Hoboken, he did not go to see it or inquire into the
matter—in fact, it appears that he never went at all, though
he had been there inquiring for her before. This is odd,
and should have been explained.

		<b>The Hoboken Murder.</b>
   In spite of the intensity of the public feeling on
this awful outrage, nothing but conjecture is known
of the perpetration, or even of the bloody <i>locale</i> of the
deed. An Evening paper has published the follow-
ing communication:—
<m9>		N<small>EW</small> Y<small>ORK</small>, Saturday, Aug. 7th, 1841.
   G<small>ENTLEMEN</small>:—If you consider what I am about to com-
	...
   On Sunday, the 25th of July, I was sauntering toward
evening on the banks at Hoboken. My attention was
suddenly arrested by a boat rushing across the Hudson
from New York, at great speed; and when it neared the
land, I perceived that there were in the boat six men,
and <i>one young well-dressed female</i>, who I felt confident,
from description, as also from a dim recollection of my
own, was the <u>Segar</u> Girl. Immediately as they touched
the strand, the six men and the female left the boat, and
proceeded towards the woods. I then noticed that the
men were of that class denominated “rowdies”—such
	...
as if in quest of some object. The gentlemen I have allu-
ded to before, being nearest these men, one of them asked
him if they had seen a female and several men landing
from a boat? The gentlemen replied in the affirmative.
“Did you observe,” asked the same man, “if they used
any violence with her?” The <u>gentleman</u> answered “no.”
And then the boatmen being informed of the route the
first party took, followed after at a rapid stride—almost a
run.
   The above is all I know about this affair, but I am firm-
ly persuaded in my own mind, that the young lady brought
over in the first boat was the <i>cigar girl</i> who was so bru-
tally murdered a few hours afterwards. I wonder the
two gentlemen have not made their experience in this
matter public—for I am sure that they must entertain the
same suspicions that I do.</m9>
   On this thin affair a morning paper speculates as
follows:—
<m9>   The two gentlemen alluded to in the above, are Wm. D.
Fanshaw, (nephew of Daniel Fanshaw, printer to the
American Bible and Tract Societies,) and his brother-in-
law, Mr. Thomas. We have called on Mr. Fanshaw to
ascertain the correctness of the statements in the letter,
and he informs us that they are correct in every particu-
lar.</m9>
   There must be some mistake in this statement.
On the Sunday evening in question, there was a vio-
lent thunderstorm, which began before sundown, and
did not clear away till 10 o'clock, P.M. Just before
the storm many left Hoboken for the city. Two gen-
tlemen residing in Hoboken, happened to have been
at the Elysian Fields when the storm began. They
remained till 10 o'clock, when it had cleared up, and
then returned to the village by the sea shore. It was
then clear. They saw no person or boat—heard
none—every thing was quiet. Again, Mary Rogers'
face was well known to all “young men about
town” from her having been in Anderson's store. If
she had been at Hoboken on that day, she would
have been seen by dozens of persons that would have
recognised her.
   The theory, theretofore, that she was carried to
Hoboken and murdered there, is not founded on the
facts of the case. All the known circumstances re-
but such an idea. In this view of the case, another
paper has the following:—
<m9>   Under the present excitement, produced by the mys-
terious outrage committed upon the person of Miss Mary
Rogers, I take the liberty of submitting the following
remarks for your consideration, as from the nature of
the case they have suggested themselves to me.
   It is now a matter of general supposition, that the out-
rage was perpetrated at Hoboken, from the fact of the
body being found in its immediate vicinity, and the vic-
tim having been there during the day upon which it is
conjectured the murder was committed. These opinions,
in connection with the various statements in relation to
the tragedy, tend in a great measure to fix upon Hoboken
as the scene of the bloody affair, but when we take into
consideration the following facts, together with the lo-
cation of the body when found, it serves in my opinion to
lessen the probability of the act having been committed
at the above named place, and fixes an almost equal
amount of suspicion on our city.
   It is well known, that at the time the body was first dis-
covered, there was, and had been a prevalence of north
and north-easterly winds for almost a week previous.
In all such cases a very powerful current is produced,
tending down the river, strikes Glass House Point, and
so sets across with great power, to the exact neighbor-
hood in which the body was found, so that any floating
substance, under such circumstances, would naturally
find its way to the Hoboken shore, and there remain
fixed, until a change of wind, and its consequent current,
should carry it elsewhere. Now then had the murder,
as alleged, been committed at Hoboken, the body could
not possibly have <i>left</i> the shore such a distance, while
so strong a current was setting in against it, and conse-
quently would have been discovered at a much earlier
period.
   For proof of the foregoing argument, it is only neces-
sary to point you to the numerous instances in which de-
composed substances thrown from the docks in the up-
per part of the city, are found lying upon the opposite
shores; and such is the difficulty to remove them, that it
is necessary to tow them out a considerable distance
into the stream, to keep them from the influence of this
current, and give them an opportunity to pass down to
the lower bay, and yet the body of the murdered girl
was found some two or three hundred yards <i>from</i> the
shore.
   With this view of the case, there is (in my opinion) as
great a probability of the murder having been commit-
ted in our city as elsewhere, and there should the pur-
suits of justice be directed, for some trace of the spot
where the tragedy was enacted.			E.</m9>
   This is the most rational conjecture, and is corro-
borated by residents at Hoboken, who state a great
many facts, showing the cause of the current. Doc-
tor Cook, of Hoboken, thinks that a body thrown
into the river near Castle Garden, would float to-
wards Castle Point, near the place where Mary's body
was found.
   Every fact tends to confirm the conjecture that
Mary Rogers <i>was violated and murdered in this city—
and if so, how? when?—by whom?</i> Was it not per-
petrated in some of the hundred assignation houses
which are permitted to exist by our grave adminis-
trators of criminal police? Ought not every one of
these dens to be searched at once, for traces of vio-
lence, murder and blood? More then one person
had been engaged in this horrid crime—it cannot hide
itself forever. The murder will out, but proper
means must be adopted to help it out.
		<small id="Herald-1841-08-12-Daniel-Payne">FURTHER PARTICULARS</small>.
   The following, from our Reporter, throws but
little light on the fate of the poor girl. It shows,
however, that the Police are not idle:—
<m9>   T<small>HE</small> M<small>ARY</small> R<small>OGERS</small> M<small>YSTERY</small>.—Yesterday afternoon,
the body of the unfortunate girl found on the shores of
Hoboken, and supposed to be that of Mary Rogers, was
disinterred for the purpose of identification. It was
brought over under an order issued by Elijah F. Purdy,
Acting Mayor, and placed in the Dead House. Of course,
it is one mass of decomposition, and cannot be identified
except by the clothes.
   The following statement was made by a man who ap-
pears to have been a sort of a lover of the unfortunate
girl.
   A man of the name of Daniel Payne came to the Police
Office at the request of the magistrate, and voluntarily
made a long statement, under oath, from which we have
condensed the following facts:—
   Daniel Payne had been a boarder in the house of Mrs.
Rogers since last October or November, and been so in-
timate with Mary, that they were engaged to have been
married. On the Sunday of her disappearance, Mary
knocked at the bedroom door of Payne, about 10 o'clock,
as he was making his toilet, and told him that “she was
going to Mrs. <u>Downings</u>,” and he replied, “very well,
Mary, I shall look out for you in the evening.” She then
appeared well and cheerful, and Payne has not seen her
since.
   Payne states that he went out about 11 o'clock that
Sunday, and went straight to his brother's in Warren
street, and remained in his company until 1 P. M. Part
of these two hours were spent in the house and part at
Scott's Bazaar, Dey street. After one o'clock Payne
walked up Broadway and thence to Bickford's in James
street, and read the papers until 2 o'clock—then to Ful-
ton street and dined at an eating house. About 3 P.M.
Payne went home and lay down till 6 o'clock, when he
walked to the Battery. As he left he says he met his
brother with his children, spoke to them at the gate and
parted. On reaching Ann street, Payne saw the storm
gathering, and walked to Bickford's in James street,
staid until 9 o'clock, and retired for the night.
   Payne says he thought the <u>omnibusses</u> run on Sunday,
and should have waited for Mary had the night been
clear. Payne says he never knew of Mary keeping com-
pany with any person but himself, nor of any male per-
son calling on her casually. Her habits were domestic,
and she was not in the habit of leaving the house except
to visit her relations.
   On Sunday evening about 9 o'clock, Mrs. Hayes, aunt
of Mary, said to Payne, “it is surprising that she, Mary,
has not returned home,” but added that her mother had
concluded, that she was prevented by the storm, and had
staid with Mrs. Downing all night. Nothing further
transpired that night.</m9>
<d>[Col.3]</d>
<m9>   The next morning at breakfast, Mary's mother said
that Mrs. Hayes had gone home to her house to see if
Mary was there. She returned and told she was not
there. Nothing more transpired until dinner, when
Payne says he heard for the first time that Mary had not
been heard of either at Mrs. Downing's or at Mrs. Hayes.
He then commenced a search for her himself. First
went to a Mrs. Pitcher's, at Harlem, and ascertained she
had not been there—next went to Williamsburg, without
success, and next visited Hoboken, Staten Island, and
the South Ferry without getting any tidings. On Tues-
day put an advertisement in the paper and called
on the keeper of a public house at the corner of
Duane and William streets. Went there in consequence
of a note having been received, stating that a girl had
been to <u>Collins'</u>, with a man, on Sunday afternoon, and
staid there three hours. This proved not to answer
the description of Mary, and Payne went again to Hobo-
ken, and made more particular inquiries—asked several
people at the ferry house, and at three different places
near the landing, and went along the shore to the Ely-
sian Fields, but without success. He returned to the
city, and shortly after heard from Mr. <u title="Luther">Luthur</u>, of No. 90
Chambers street, that Mary's body had been found at
Hoboken, and an inquest was to be held. Mr. Payne did
not go to Hoboken, in consequence of this information,
but a Mr. <u>Cromelin</u> did, and he said it was the body of
Mary, that the inquest was held, and the body buried.
   After this, it would appear that no further inquiries
were made until the press took the matter in hand. Of
course Mr. Payne was not detained, as no suspicion
rests on him.</m9>

<b id="Herald-1841-08-12-PM">Public Meeting in Relation to the Late
			Murder</b>.
   A numerous and highly respectable meeting was
held last night, at the house of James C. Stoneall, 29
Ann street, in relation to the above horrible affair.
   Upon motion of William H. Attree, the meeting
was called to order, by the appointment of Roder-
ick N. Morrison to the chair; Thomas Bell, Vice
President, and Richard Adams Locke and Hugh
Pattinson, as secretaries.
   W. H. Attree then offered the following preamble
and resolutions, which were unanimously adopted:—
   At a preliminary meeting held at the house of James
C. Stoneall, 29 Ann street, on the 11th day of August,
1841, to take measures for procuring the arrest and con-
viction of any or all those concerned in the above mur-
der, the following preamble and resolutions were adop-
ted:—
   Whereas, the members of this meeting view with
alarm and horror the circumstances connected with the
shocking murder of Mary C. Rogers. They also recol-
lect, with deep regret, that within the last few years
several murders has been committed in this city and
neighborhood, for the perpetration of which no one has
been brought to punishment. And without desiring to
cast unnecessary censure upon any of the authorities,
they deprecate the apparent apathy that has character-
ized the Chief Magistrates of the States of New Jersey
and New York, and the authorities of the county of
New York, in not offering a reward for the arrest of any
or all those concerned in the late murder—and believing
that in the present inefficiently organized state of our
Police Department, that little will be done towards de-
tecting the authors or perpetrators of this awful crime,
without a reward:
   Be it theretofore,
   Resolved, That a Committee of Twenty be appointed
by this meeting, to collect subscriptions for a reward to
be placed in the hands of a Treasurer to be appointed in
like manner, the reward to be paid on the apprehension
and conviction of any one of the murderers, with power
to add to their numbers.
   Resolved, That the same committee be called a “Com-
mittee of Safety,” with power to act in aid of the public
authorities, and to take such measures as they shall
deem proper (not conflicting with the foregoing reso-
lution) to effect the detection of the murderer or mur-
derers.
   Resolved, That we earnestly request our fellow citi-
zens to convene in their respective wards, and orga-
nize as they shall deem proper, to co-operate with the
aforesaid Committee in carrying out the object of this
meeting.
   Resolved, That the thanks of this meeting be given to
the public press of this city, for having repeatedly called
public attention to this horrible case; and that all the
editors be requested again to aid the Committee in pub-
lishing these proceedings.
   Upon motion of W. H. Attree, Mr. James C. Stone-
all was appointed the Treasurer.
   The following gentlemen were then appointed:—
				C<small>OMMITTEE</small>.
	Caleb S. Woodhull,		James Nesbitt,
	Revo C. Hance,			William H. Attree,
	William Thompson,		J. C. <u>Stonehall</u>,
	Thomas Bell,			R. <u>H</u>. Morrison,
	Robert <u title="Sinclair">Sinclain</u>,			Mr. Barton,
	Robt. Elton,			Vair Clirehugh,
	Hugh Pattinson,			Amos Leeds,
	William C. Carl,			John Lomas,
	Dudley Pearce,			Aaron Clark,
	E. R. Yale,				Charles H. Lovejoy,
	Daniel D. Howard,		John Cleveland,
	Leonard <u>T. Snithen</u>,		E. <u>G</u>. Paige.

   Mr. Attree then stated, that within the last few
hours he had personally waited upon the following
gentlemen, who had severally agreed to pay the
sums placed opposite to their respective names, upon
the arrest and conviction of any one of the murder-
ers, independent of any reward that might be offer-
ed by the authorities of either State or <u title="county">coanty</u>.
   The reading of this list was received with loud
cheers.

we can tell; for this same Bill Wiley, otherwise Wil-

Courts, was yesterday arrested, on a bench warrant,
and taken before his Honor the Recorder. The
charge against the worthy Justice is, for receiving
valuables, knowing them to have been stolen from
the premises of the President and Directors of the
Frederick County Bank, Md. Justice Wiley imme-
diately proffered Joseph Tucker and Robert Smith,
Esquires, ex-Aldermen of the city, as sureties that
he would appear at the next term of the Sessions,
and these gentlemen having all bound themselves,
severally and individually, in $10,000 each, the Jus-
tice was set at liberty. Officers A. M. C. Smith, and
<s>Jeffers</s> of Baltimore, acting for the Bank Directors,
had the Honor of effecting the arrest of the renowned
“Bill Wiley, of that ilk.” The trial will elicit some
most superlative roguery.

up the young lady, who was taken out of a boat on the

   If there is wanting any evidence of the utter inef-
ficiency of our present Police system, the annexed
statement, which is offered without comment, will
go far towards convincing the most sceptical.
   We yesterday briefly mentioned the case of a girl,
who while in company with one young man in a
boat, was taken thence by a gang of young rowdies,
who took her to Hoboken. It was yesterday under-
stood that no violence had been offered to her, but
since that we have seen the affidavit of the girl, which
is to this effect. On the 25th of July, (Sunday,)
while in a boat on the Hudson with one young man,
another boat came alongside, in which were seven
young men averaging about <i>seventeen years of age</i>,
who beat and maltreated her companion, and forcibly
took her from the boat, landed her at Hoboken and
then took her into the woods, where she was treated
with the most brutal violence by the party. She
was then put back into the boat, and landed in this
city at a late hour. Every one of these hopeful gal-
lows birds had on their <i>braces, backs, or bosoms</i> the
figures 27. Of course they could not be members of
the Fire Department, and the question is who are
they. The girl does not know the name of one of
them. If they are volunteer boys, the quicker they
are turned adrift entirely by any company to which
they may have fastened themselves, the better. We
should judge it might be for the reputation of the
company.

   <i id="Courier-1841-08-12-Daniel-Payne">The case of Mary C. Rogers</i>.—Perhaps not the
least extraordinary feature of this horrid outrage is
the fact, that notwithstanding the most strenuous
efforts on the part of our authorities, not one trace of
the unfortunate girl has ever been discovered after
the door of her mother's house closed upon her forever.
Even up to this moment it is not fully known that
the body of the girl found at Hoboken is that of Miss
Rogers, that having been identified only by Mr. A.
Crommelin, who had boarded with her mother some
six months.
   Yesterday Mr. Daniel Payne voluntarily came to
the Police office, for the purpose of being examined
and of shedding, if possible, some light upon the
darkness that now envelopes her fate. He states
that he had known Mary since October or Novem-
ber last, during which time, up to the past few days
he had boarded with her mother at 126 Nassau street.
That the acquaintance with her soon grew into a
warmer feeling, and they had been engaged to be
married some time previous to her final and myster-
ious disappearance.
   On the morning of Sunday the 25th July, about
10 o'clock, while he was in his room shaving, she
came up stairs and knocked at his door. He opened
it and found her dressed for a walk, and she said she
was going to see Mrs. Downing, an acquaintance, re-
siding at No. 68 <u>James</u> street. He said very well, he
would come for her in the evening—she then appear-
ed as happy and cheerful as usual, and started off and
form that moment, all trace of her has been lost.
   Mr. Payne stated that she had been up to Mrs.
Downing's two or three times, upon which occasions
he would go in the evening to the corner of Broad-
way and Ann streets and watch for her in the <u>Omni-
buss</u>. Upon this occasion he did no go to seek for
her, as a violent storm sprang up, and he felt sure
that she would not attempt to leave Mrs. D.'s that
night.
   The witness then went on and gave a very detail-
ed and circumstantial account of the manner in
which he had passed that Sunday, after parting with
Mary at the door of his room. In the early part of
that evening, while he was up in his room, Mrs.
Hayes, an aunt of Mary's, came up to enquire about
her, saying that Mrs. R. was very uneasy; but he
told her where she had gone, and that from the na-
ture of the weather he did not expect her home that
night.
   The next morning while at work in his shop, he
first heard the intelligence that she had not been
either to Mrs. <u>Downings</u> or to Mrs. Hayes. He
then set to work to discover her if possible, and
went to every place in and out of the city, where
there was any possibility of hearing of her. He went
to Hoboken, to Harlem, to Staten Island, Williams-
burgh, and in fact every where, and he caused ad-
vertisements to be inserted in the papers, noticing
her disappearance. Nothing, however, has to this
moment been heard, tending to throw any light
upon her dreadful end.
   It will be seen that the testimony of Mr. Payne is
unimportant, except as far as it discloses her inten-
tions of visiting a friend on the fatal Sunday.
   The body of the unfortunate girl was brought to
this city yesterday afternoon, upon requisition of the
authorities here, and the shell enclosing it was open-
ed, in order that Mr. Payne or any others might have
an opportunity of identifying her. The body how-
ever was so much decomposed, that recognition of
the features was impossible; but Mr. Payne thought
that the hat in the coffin was hers. One shoe only
was on, the other being in the possession of Mr. Crom-
melin. Such of the clothes as were left upon the
body, (for she was buried with every thing on,) are to
be sent to her mother to know if she can identify
them. It is pretty certain, however, that the body is
that of the unfortunate Mary. As yet, nothing has
been developed, that can at all implicate any person
as being concerned in the horrid outrage. Further
examination will take place this day.

   <i>A Horrible Murder</i>.—On Sunday
morning week, Miss Cecilia <u>Rodgers</u>,
(who formerly attended John Anderson's
tobacco store in Broadway, and was
known as <u>the</u> “The beautiful cigar girl”)
left her home, 126 Nassau st., for a
walk; and at the corner of Theatre
Alley she was met and accosted by a
young man, apparently an acquaintance,
	...
the body of Miss Rogers, and it was ev-
ident that she had been horribly out-
	...
city since the murder was committed.—
<i>N. Y. Tribune</i>.	———
   <i>Later</i>.—Some doubt is expressed now,
(says the N. Y. Express of Monday)
whether Miss Rogers was murdered at
Hoboken, or in this city. It is supposed
that she may have been decoyed into
some den this side the river, violated and
then murdered, her violator subsequently
rowing her body over to Hoboken where
it was thrown into the river.
   Mr. Justice Merritt has said it was a
matter of great regret that the body
was not exposed for a day or two,.to give
an opportunity to those who had seen
her on Sunday, the 25th ult., to identify
her, and perhaps to point out and des-
cribe with whom she was, and under
what circumstances she was seen. It
appears that a rope was tied round her
neck, over the top of her bonnet and
round her body in such a way that it
could easily be carried by means of it,
and <u title="Justice">Justiue</u> Matsell is of opinion, from
the nature of the ties, knots, &c., that
they must have been made by seafaring
men.

terday</u> a meeting was held at Mr. Stoneall's, at
which a committee was appointed to collect sub-
scriptions with the view of offering a reward for
the detection of the murderers of Miss Rogers.
We must confess that we share in the surprise
which has been expressed that the public authori-
ties have not promptly offered a large reward for the
discovery of the perpetrators of a crime which has
filled the community with horror.
   The sum of $<u title="My sum is 457 (from the list in Herald-1841-08-12)">445</u>, we understand, was subscri-
bed, which will be paid upon the conviction of the
murderers, aside from any reward which the civil

to the circumstances under which she was last

   T<small>HE</small> M<small>URDER OF</small> M<small>ISS</small> R<small>OGERS</small>.—The body of
this unfortunate girl was yesterday, at the request
of our city authorities, disinterred and brought
from Jersey to this city, and deposited in the dead
house in the Park. And difficult would it be for
the most imaginative mind to conceive a spectacle
more horrible or humiliating to humanity. There
lay, what was but a few days back, the image of its
Creator, the loveliest of his works, and the tene-
ment of an immortal soul, now a blackened and
decomposed mass of putrefaction, painfully dis-
gusting to sight and smell. Her skin which had
been unusually fair was now black as that of a ne-
gro. Her eyes so sunk in her swollen face as to
have the appearance of being violently forced be-
yond the sockets, and her mouth, which “no
friendly hand had closed in death,” was distended
as wide as the ligaments of the jaws would admit,
and wore the appearance of a person who had died
from suffocation or strangulation. The remainder
of her person was alike one mass of putrefaction
and corruption, on which the worms were revelling
at their will. And as if nothing should be want-
ing to send the moral home to men's hearts, and
render it more painfully <u title="'oppressive' in Mohawk Courier">impressive</u>, the young man
who was to have been, in a few days, married to
her, now stood beside the rough box in which all
that remained of her he loved was lying. Her
whom but a few days back, he had seen, “exulting
in her youth,” filled with life, hope and animation,
whom he so ardently wished to make his wedded
wife, to fold to his bosom, to press to “his heart
of hearts,” now lay before him an inanimate mass
of matter, so hideous, horrible and offensive, that
the bare idea of coming in contact with it was al-
most sufficient to make the gorge rise. The re-
mains even of her dress, in which she had been
buried, were already so discolored and half rotten,
as to render it almost impossible to be identified,
and was so impregnated with the effluvia from her
person, that scarcely any person would venture to
touch or examine it.
   The chief object in bringing the body over to this
city, was that it might be identified beyond all
doubt, which it appears had not been hitherto done,
at least to the satisfaction of our city authorities,
until yesterday. Amongst the strangest and most
mysterious circumstances of the murder, is perhaps
the fact that from the hour she last left her mo-
ther's door, to the time when her body was found
floating in the river, no trace whatever of her has
been discovered, nor can any person be found who,
for one moment saw her, in that interim.
   Justices Parker and Merritt and Mr. <u title="Callender">Calender</u>,
clerk of the Police Office, attended at the dead
house, for several hours yesterday evening for the
purpose of further examining the matter, but they
were unable to elicit more than had been already
known. In the course of the evening a coffin was
procured, into which the unfortunate girl's remains
were removed from the rough box in which they
had been buried, and they still remain in the dead
house in the Park.
   The following is all the evidence which the Po-
lice have been as yet able to obtain on the subject.<a id="Evening-Post-1841-08-12-Case"></a>
   C<small>ASE OF</small> M<small>ARY</small> C. R<small>OGERS</small>.—Daniel C. Payne,
of No. 47 John street, cork cutter, went yesterday
to the Police office, at the request of Justice Par-
ker, to give any information he might possess, or
which might tend to throw any light upon the dis-
appearance of Miss Mary C. Rogers, said to have
been murdered at Hoboken, and made the follow-
ing statements:—“I have known Mary C. Rogers
since October or November last, at which time I
went to board at her mother's, at No. 126 Nassau
street. During my stay there, (which was until
within a few days of the time Mrs. Rogers gave up
keeping boarders,) myself and Miss Rogers formed
an attachment for each other, the result of which
was that we were engaged to be married. The last
time I saw her was on Sunday morning, the 25th
July last.
   About the hour of ten o'clock on that morning, I
was busy shaving myself in my room, when she
came and knocked at my door; upon which I open-
ed the same, when she told me she was going to
Mrs. Downing's; when I replied, very well, Ma-
ry, I shall look out for you in the evening. At this
time she appeared cheerful and lively as usual.—
During the time that I had been acquainted with
her she had been to Mrs. Downing's some three or
four times to my knowledge; and<u title=" on (elsewhere)"> </u>two occasions as
she returned from there, I had waited for her about
dark, on the corner of Broadway and Ann street,
until she alighted from an omnibus, and then walk-
ed home with her.
   Mrs. Downing lives in Jane street, No. 68. I
did not go to the corner of Ann street and Broad-
way on this occasion to wait for her, as I had done
before, on account of a very heavy storm coming on
about dusk, and I feeling in my own mind that she
would not leave Mrs. Downing's that night, but re-
main there, as she had done on another occasion.—
Upon leaving the house that morning, which was
about 11 o'clock, I walked directly to my brother's,
John Payne's, in Warren street, No. 33, and re-
mained in his company until 1 o'clock part of the
time in the house and part of the time out. When
out of the house, we went to Scott's Bazaar, in Dey
street, where we remained until about one, when
we left there and walked up to Broadway and
parted company near St. Paul's Church. I then
walked up into James street, at Mr. Bickford's,
and read the newspapers until about 2 o'clock, and
then came down, and took my dinner at Goslin's
eating house, in Fulton street. I then went home,
and at 3 o'clock was lying on my bed, and remain-
ed there until about 6 o'clock, when I dressed my-
self and walked down to the Battery, and remain-
ed there until about a quarter past seven o'clock.
When I left, my brother was coming off the Batte-
ry with his children, to whom I spoke for a mo-
ment or <u title="two (in Sunbury American)">so</u>, and then parted. I walked up Broad-
way, and when near Ann street, noticed a storm
was fast coming up, and thinking it was too early
to go to bed, I walked up to Bickford's, in James
street, and remained there until nine o'clock, and
then went home and retired for the night. I was
under the impression that the omnibuses run on
Sundays, and had the weather been clear, I should
have waited for Mary on the corner of Ann street
and Broadway, as usual. I have never known Ma-
ry, since I have been in the house, to keep compa-
ny with any person but myself, and do not know of
her ever having any male person to casually call
upon her.
   Her habits were very domestic, she scarcely
ever leaving the house, and I do not think that she
ever left the house in company with any other per-
son but myself.<!-- Right quote (”) here? --><a id="Evening-Post-1841-08-12-Alarmed-mother"></a>
   Daniel Payne, on his further examination, said:
—“On my return home on Sunday evening, about
the hour of 9 o'clock, I was asked by Mrs. Hayes,
the aunt of Mary, who was in the house, and who
had come there after I left at 6 o'clock, where Mary
was, when I replied that she had gone to Mrs.
Downing's, when Mrs. Hayes replied that her
mother was very much alarmed about her, and had
gone to her house, (that is Mrs. Hayes' house) to
enquire for her. Nothing further upon the subject
of Mary's absence then passed between us, except-
<d>[Col.4]</d>
ing that Mrs. Hayes made the remark, that she
supposed that she would be home in the morning.
Mrs. Hayes then offered me a light to take to my
room. I declined it, stating that I always went in
the dark. When I took my breakfast on the fol-
lowing morning, Mrs. Rogers remarked that Mrs.
Hayes had gone to her house to see if Mary was
there, and was to return immediately and let me
know. I then went to work, presuming, if all was
not right, that they would let me know at the shop.
   I heard nothing more until I returned home to
my dinner, and then heard that she had not been
either at Mrs. Downing's or Mrs. Hayes', at which
the family were much alarmed. I then commenced
searching for her, and in the first place went to
Mrs. Pitcher's, at Harlem, and made enquiry there
for her, when they informed me she had not been
there. This was the only place that I knew of her
being acquainted out of the family. I next went
to Williamsburg to search for her. I did not know
any one there, and had no reason for going there
any more than any other place, but thought I must
make a general enquiry, and the next day proceed-
ed to Hoboken, also to Staten Island, and also
crossed over the South Ferry, and enquired of dif-
ferent persons at all those places, describing her to
them. On the evening of the same day, I carried
an advertisement to the Sun newspaper, respect-
ing her absence, &c. On the following day, Wed-
nesday, I made further enquiry and searched for
her, and first of all called upon a keeper of a public
house, on the corner of Duane and William streets,
kept by <u>Callas</u>, owing to a note having been received
at the house, by the mother, without signature, that
they could tell something about her, when on enquiry
I ascertained that a young girl had called there and
remained in company with a young man for three
hours; but the description of this girl did not at all
answer the description of Mary, and not only so,
the girl who was there they stated was in the prac-
tice of chewing snuff while she was there, and was
dressed in blue. I then proceeded to Hoboken, it
being between 9 and 10 o'clock, and made inquiry
about Hoboken, and also along the shore, as far as
the Elysian Fields House. I did not make any in-
quiry at the last mentioned house, but did before I
got there. I inquired for her at the ferry, and three
times between the ferry and the house. These in-
quiries were made of two different persons whom I
casually met on the road, and at a public house
close to Van Buskirk's, but obtained no trace of her
whatever. I then returned to the city about 1 or 2
o'clock, and in the afternoon went to my store, but
did not go to work, and returned home again about
7 o'clock.
   After having been in the house a quarter of an
hour, a gentleman, whose name I was informed by
him was Luther, and residing at No. 90 Chambers
street, came into the dining room, where myself
and others were sitting, and informed me that a
body had been found by him in the water near Ho-
boken, which he supposed, form the description of
the dress, to be the body of Miss Rogers, who had
been advertised in the newspapers. I did not go
to Hoboken to identify the body at that time nor
since.
   Before I was out of my bed on the following
morning, Mr. Crommelin came and informed the
family that he had been to Hoboken, and that the
body there found was the body of Mary. I think
it was about half past six (he afterwards said five
o'clock) in the morning when I arose. Mr. Crom-
melin also informed us that the inquest had been
held on the night before, which did away with the
necessity for myself or the family going to Hobo-
ken.—<i>Journal of Commerce</i>.

   <i>Mysterious Murder in Hoboken</i>.—
An inquest was held at Castle Point,
Hoboken, on the 28th ult., on the body
of Mary C. Rogers, for some time
known as the 'beautiful cigar girl' in a
store in Chatham street, in New York,
who, from the decision of the jury,
came to her death by violence commit-
ted by some person or persons unknown,
sufficient to cause her death. The de-
ceased had been absent from her home
in New York since some time on the
<u title="preceding">preceeding</u> Sunday, and appears to have
borne an irreproachable character.—
Her body was found in the river where
it was supposed to have been thrown,
after the desperate act of violence was
committed.

   T<small>HE</small> M<small>URDER OF</small> M<small>ISS</small> R<small>OGERS</small>.—There was another long
examination in this case at the Police Office yesterday, from
8 A. M. to 7 P. M. which resulted in little more than the
identification of body found in the river near Hoboken on
the 28th as that of Mary C. Rogers, who left her home on
the morning of Sunday the 25th. Alfred <u>Cromeline</u>, who had
boarded in the family and was at one time attached to Miss
R., swore positively that the body he saw at Hoboken was
hers, and produced one of her shoes, a sleeve and skirt of
her dress, part of her pantalettes, &c. which he took from
the body and brought home to her mother. Mrs. <u title="Phoebe">Phœbe</u>
Rogers also identified the dress taken from the body found
at Hoboken as that which her daughter wore away on the
morning of the 25th. <u>Cromeline</u>, it appears, had been a fa-
vored suitor of Miss R. but was finally discarded for Daniel
Payne, the substance of whose testimony we gave yesterday.
<u>Cromeline</u> had told Mrs. and Miss R. that whenever they
should be in trouble, to send for him. A note from Mrs. Ro-
gers (in the hand-writing of Mary) asking him to call had
been left for him the Friday before Sunday the 25th, but
he did not go, as he had been coldly received when last there.
On Saturday the 24th, (as A. W. Padley testifies,) the name
of Miss Rogers was written on <u>Cromeline</u>'s slate, and a rose
left in the key-hole of his door. <u>Cromeline</u>, it appears, went
over to Hoboken on Wednesday afternoon, staid till late at
night, during which time the inquest was held and the body
temporarily buried, (as the weather was very hot, and it had
become very offensive;) and when he started to come home,
the boats had ceased running. He walked round to Jersey
City, and found the boats there stopped also, and was obliged
to stay over night. This accounts for the burial of the body
without being seen by her mother or Payne.
   William H. <u>Kiekuck</u>, the sailor, was again rigidly exam-
ined, but nothing elicited to implicate him at all in the affair.
   Henry Mallin and James M. <u>Boullard</u>, of 333 and <u>331</u>
Broadway, who first discovered the body floating in the water
near Hoboken, at 3 o'clock, P. M. of Wednesday, 28th,
were examined, and testified that <u>no jewelry or rings were
on the body when found, though Miss Rogers wore such
away</u>. There was no rope or other fastening about the body.
   These were all the facts elicited of any moment. The ex-
amination will be continued from day to day until the mur-
derers are discovered. The Police, under the direction of
the Mayor and Recorder, are doing all that men can do
to ferret out the criminals. Any person who saw Miss
Rogers any where after leaving her mother's house on the
morning of the 25th, is earnestly requested to communicate
the fact to the Police Office.

		<m8>Reported for the Courier and Enquirer.</m8>
		POLICE.—Thursday.
   <i>The Case of Mary C. Rogers.</i>—The Magistrates
and clerks were occupied yersterday in examining wit-
nesses in this exciting case. But by reference to the
testimony annexed, it will be seen that nothing new
or useful has been elicited—all doubts as to the identity
of the unfortunate girl are now set at rest, and the
only <i>desideratum</i> now is to discover if possible her
brutal murderers. To this end, we in common with
all the city papers have been requested to call pub-
lic attention to this fact—Mary on Sunday said she
was going to Mrs. Downing's in Jane street. Her
most direct route to that quarter of the city, would be
up Broadway to Chamber street, down Chamber to
Hudson, and up Hudson to Jane street, and we have
been devised to ask of any person who may have
seen her on that day, to call at the Police Office, and
give information as to where abouts she was so seen.
Once a single trace of her is discovered, the officers
will follow it up, and we think we may safely say,
that if they once only hear of her alive after she left
her mother's house, a discovery will inevitably follow,
of the inhuman murderers.
   The examinations held yesterday, it will be seen,
shed no light upon the mystery, but the apathy which
has heretofore marked the course of her relations
and friends, and of the man to whom she was engag-
ed, is almost past credence. When they were in-
formed by Mr. Crommelin, who was comparatively
a stranger, that Mary's body had been found at Ho-
boken, not one of them took the pains to cross the
river, and take a last look at her remains. They took
<s>this stranger's word</s> that her body should be cared
for, and beyond that they seemed to have no care.—
Even Payne made no attempt to see her body, and in
fact, could not have positively known up to yester-
day, whether the girl to whom he was soon to be
married, was dead or alive. He heard that she was
dead—that she had been brutally outraged and mur-
dered, and he was satisfied. Even the last offices
were left to be paid to her remains by a stranger. No
parent, relation or friend was there to see her consign-
ed to her grave, and she was buried into her coffin,
if the box that contained her, can be so called, with-
out any regard to propriety, to decency, or humani-
ty. The veriest pauper that was ever thrown upon
charity would have been buried in a more decent
manner than was Mary C. Rogers. We learn that
it is now contemplated to have a public funeral.
   It is but just to the magistrates and officers to
state, that they have thus far shown the most untir-
ing zeal in their efforts to ferret out the authors of
the outrage, and we are <s>safe</s> in predicting that if they
<d>[Col.3]</d>
once obtain a single clue, the rest will be soon trac-
ed out, and the murderers be brought to punishment.

   [Annexed is the evidence taken yesterday.]
   Alfred Crommelin, 19 John street, says that he
went to Mrs. P. Rogers 126 Nassau street to board,
on 7th December, 1840, and remained there till
about the first day of June last, and during that time,
a daughter of Mrs. R., Mary Cecilia had the charge
of the whole house. He did not visit the house after
he took away his baggage.
   About three days before 25th July, Mrs. R. or
Mary called to see him every day, and left a note
signed by Mrs. R., although the note was written by
Mary, requesting him to call on them in Nassau st.,
which he did not do, although he intended to do so
on Sunday the 25th. He did not call for this
reason—that Payne who was addressing Mary, was
a dissipated man, and the family treated him very
coldly; and on reflection he determined to stay at
home and did so, on the 25th, all day. Archibald
Padley staid in the same house in John street all
day. In the evening they went to the battery, thence
to Atlantic Garden, and thence to 127 Cedar st.,
where he slept.
   On Monday and Tuesday he heard that Mary was
missing, and on Wednesday he saw the advertise-
ment for her, and when he saw this he thought there
was something serious about it, as he thought she
was at Mrs. <u>Downings</u> or Mrs. <u>Hays</u>. He then felt
sorry that he had not gone to see them on Sunday
as he had intended, owing to the circumstance that
when he left Mrs. Rogers he told Mary he was sorry
for the step she was about taking, and that if she ever
was in trouble to call on him. He then (on Wednes-
day) went to Mrs. R.'s and saw her and Dan Payne.
Payne left the house as witness came in, which he
thought very singular. Witness asked Mrs. R. what
sent him off in such a hurry, and she said he had
gone to Bellevue to look for Mary. Witness after
hearing the story from Mrs. R. came to the conclu-
sion that Mary had been forcibly detained in some as-
signation house, or some other place, and came im-
mediately to the Police Office and intended to have
seen young Hays, the officer, knowing there was
such a man by reputation as an able officer, and on
enquiring did not see him. Then went to a tavern
near the <a href="http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47e0-d411-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99">Shakspeare Hotel</a>, as he understood that
they received a note that Mary had been seen there
on Sunday, 25th July. I understood that a girl had
been there, from the Landlord Alman, about 2 o'clock
which did not answer Mary's description. He then
went down to Mrs. Rogers, and told them he was
going over to Hoboken to look for her, which he did
that afternoon, 28th July, in company with Arch'd
Padley. Went the river walk up along shore, and
saw a number of people standing on the shore, asked
the cause and received for answer that it was the body
of a drowned female; on looking at the person so
drowned recognized the body to be that of Miss Mary
C. Rogers. Remained with the body all the after-
noon, until the Coroner had taken an inquest, which
was at nearly 9 o'clock at night.
   Witness took a part of the skirt of her dress and a
piece from off her sleeve. The Doctor who was with
the Coroner, gave him the flowers form the inside and
outside of Mary's hat, a garter, the bottom of her pan-
talette, a shoe and a lock of curl of her hair, which he
brought over to Mary's mother, and all of which were
recognized by her and the family. The body was
found a little above the cave at Hoboken. The ferry
being at this time (nearly 11 at night,) closed, he walk-
ed to Jersey city, and found that also closed, when
he slept there and crossed early in the morning. He
re-crossed the next day, at the request of Mrs. R. to
Hoboken, having the evening previous made an ar-
rangement with the Coroner and Dr. Cook to meet
them for the purpose of a further examination. Dr.
C. had written a note to Dr. Beck of N. Y. to meet
them there, but he did not come.
   When he first saw the body he cut the sleeve open
and rubbed her arm for the purpose of identifying her,
and made use of ever proper means for that purpose.
He further says that at the meeting with the Coroner
and Dr. Cook, on the following morning, it was
deemed necessary, in consequence of the great heat
of the weather, to inter the body temporarily, subject
to a future examination, which was done at two feet
from the surface, and in a double coffin.
   Henry Mallin and James M. <u>Bowland</u>, who first
discovered the body floating in the river, were also
examined, and state under oath, that the body was
free from rope or cords of any kind, and that she had
no rings, or breastpin, or jewelry of any kind about
her.
   William <u>Kurkuk</u>, who has before been mentioned,
being the sailor from the North Carolina, was ex-
amined, but his evidence had no possible bearing on
the case, he not having seen her since the 3d of July
last. He has been discharged, and was sent on board
of his vessel again.<a id="Courier-1841-08-13-Mother"></a>
   The mother, aunt, and an intimate friend of <u>Marys</u>
were yesterday at the office, and immediately recog-
nized the clothes which had been taken from the cof-
fin, which was brought from Hoboken yesterday, as
belonging to Mary C. Rogers, thus setting at rest for-
ever all doubts as to the identity of the unfortunate
girl.
   By reference to Mr. <u title="Crommelin">Commelin</u>'s statement, it will
be seen that he says Mrs. Rogers or Mary called on
three different days, prior to the 25th July, to see him.
That is explained by Mrs. Rogers, who states that she
went to him to sell a due bill for $52, which a man
who had boarded with her, had given to her in pay-
ment. She had no other object in seeing him.
   Archibald Padley, of No. 19 John street, says, that
he has a room in the same story of the house as Mr.
Crommelin—that they slept there on Saturday night,
and on Sunday night Mr. Crommelin slept at his
brother-in-laws in Cedar street. This witness cor-
roborates Mr. Crommelin's statement in every par-
ticular, as to his conduct, the finding and identifying
the body. On the 23d July, Crommelin showed
witness a note from Mrs. Rogers, requesting him to
call at her house, but the note did not state upon
what business she wished to see him. On Saturday,
24th July, he saw the name of Miss Rogers written
on Mr. C.'s slate, and at the same time he saw a rose
put in the key hole of his door.
   This was the amount of Mr. Padley's testimony,
and as will be seen, is entirely unimportant, except
to corroborate that of Mr. Crommelin, and thus the
affair remains at present.
   At a late hour last evening, His Honor the Mayor
and Justice Parker, were both engaged in examining
witnesses, who had been brought before them in the
evening, but their evidence was of immaterial import.
No new arrests have been made, nor has any fact as
yet been developed, which can in any way add light
to the mystery.<f>

   The only case at this office yesterday, except that
of Mary C. Rogers, worth notice, was that of two
men named Hoasey and Kennedy, who were arrested
by officer Lounsberry, having in their possession a
cow which they had stolen, and for which an owner
is wanted at the Police office.</f>

   M<small>ORE</small> E<small>XPLANATION</small> W<small>ANTED</small>.—The “Evening
Star” says that the statement of Mr. Payne, respect-
ing Mary Rogers, is very singular, and requires more
explanation. This is very true. More explanation
is wanted.

<d>[Col.2]</d>
   U<small>NPARALLELED</small> A<small>TROCITY</small>.—Moses Y. Beach, the
poor drivelling vagabond, who keeps the penny Sun
in grease and hot corn, makes a savage attack upon
the humane meeting which was held on Wednesday
evening at Stoneall's, for the purpose of making sub-
scriptions to offer a reward for the murderer of Mary
C. Rogers. Beach is not alone losing his penny
subscribers and advertisers by dozens, scores, and
hundreds, but he loses his senses by wholesale. He
had long since lost his character—and very soon he
will lose the last handful of his own wool, by tear-
ing it off his head in pure vexation. We pity the
poor family of this unmitigated rascal. We shall
have to raise a subscription for them one of these
days. N. B.—Beach subscribed $2 to the Stone-
all subscription. Who did the fellow cheat out of
that sum?

   A<small>SK HIM</small>.—A correspondent states that, a young
man, named Canter, at the Journal of Commerce,
was a suitor of Mary C. Rogers, and was in the con-
stant habit of walking out with her. He was se-
verely beaten about a year ago by three or four ri-
vals, in consequence of visiting her. He has not as
yet been questioned about who the others were in
the habit of visiting Mary C. Rogers.

			<b>General Sessions.</b>
<m9>   Present the Recorder, Judges Noah and Lynch, and
two Aldermen.
   This being the last day of the present term of the
Court, a batch of candidates for the honor of graduating
at the <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40B16FC395F1B7A93C7AB1789D85F438185F9" title="semi-prophetic joke?">State University of Sing Sing</a> were paraded at 11
o'clock. About an hour having been wasted in gossip-
ing, earwigging and talking over matters and things in
general.

   William Henry, a negro, and Owen Lee, a white loafer
indicted for having four wives, were both discharged.
Nobody having ought to say, why they should not be
discharged, as Old Hays phrases it.
	...
   <i>Madame Restell</i>.—The Recorder stated that in this case,
unless an order was obtained from the Supreme Court
for a stay of proceedings in this Court by the first week
of next term, this Court would proceed to pass their sen-
tence on the defendant.
   <i>The Grand Jury, the Police, and the Press</i>.—The Grand
Jury came into Court with a batch of bills, which the
Foreman presented to his Honor the Recorder, and his
Honor immediately rose and told the members of the
Grand Inquest that the Court had great pleasure in say-
ing that the Grand Jury had attended to their duty with
a degree of zeal and indefatigability almost unparalleled
in the annals of the Court. Their Honors could not let
this opportunity pass, without publicly thanking the
members of the Grand Jury for their constant attend-
ance to the public business, and for the unremitting zeal
they had displayed during the present session. The
Court said his Honor would also call the attention of the
Grand Jury to the vigilance displayed by the Police De-
partment of this city, and their Honors wished to bear
testimony to this zeal and vigilance at this present time,
because the public press had taken the advantage of cer-
tain painful occurrences happening in our city, to cen-
sure in a wholesale way the whole of the persons enga-
ged in the administration of the Police and of Criminal
Justice. The officers employed to trace out the offenders
against our laws did, at all times, make use of the most
urgent despatch, but it could not at all times be known to
the public, nor was it proper, or delicate, for them to
make explanatory statements in the public prints. The
public were necessarily ignorant how, or when the Po-
lice were employed by day and by night, and it was due
to them for this Court to make this explanation to the
Grand Jury, in order to repel the unjust and calumnious
insinuations which had been latterly preferred publicly
against them.*
   His Honor said that with such a vigilant District Attor-
ney and a Court not backward in administering the laws,
it was impossible for offenders to escape; and with this
observation he thanked the Grand Jury and dismissed
them.
   Their Honors then adjourned to the first Monday in
September.
———
   * As this closing speech of his Honor to the Grand Jury
was intended as a sort of rebuke to the Press in general,
and to ourselves in particular, we will take the liberty of
reiterating one fact for our own justification, and for the
sake of enlightening his Honor. Mary Rogers it is sup-
posed, was murdered on the 27th ult. The inquest was
held at Hoboken on the 29th or 30th. On the Saturday
following an account of the facts was published in this
paper, and on the following day, Sunday, in the course of
our enquiries, we applied to one of the most courteous
and communicative of the Police functionaries to know if
any thing had been done or any discoveries made. His
reply was, on hearing the story of the <u>girls</u> fate, “<i>Good
God! it is the first we or I have heard of it</i>.” We have no
other comment to make now, in our own justification, and
the Court of Sessions may make the most of this fact.

			<b>City Intelligence.</b>
<m9>   T<small>HE</small> M<small>ARY</small> R<small>OGERS</small> M<small>YSTERY</small>.—We can only state that
nothing has been elicited calculated to throw any fur-
ther light on the whereabouts of, or the miscreants who
perpetrated this cold-blooded and heartless murder. The
Magistrates yesterday had the body recognized as that
of Mary beyond the shadow of a doubt. They also took
the following statements under oath, which implicate no
one, and leave the mystery just as much mystery as be-
fore.
   Alfred <u>Cromelin</u> residing at 19 John street, went to
board with Mrs. Rogers on the 7th December, 1840, and
staid until the 1st of June, and during that time Mary
Rogers had the superintendence of the house. Mr. <u>Cro-
melin</u> did not visit the house after he took his baggage
away.
   Mr. <u>Cromelin</u> then states that three days before the
25th of July, Mrs. Rogers or her daughter called every
day to see him, and left a note signed by Mrs. R. request-
ing him to call at their residence, which request Mr. C.
did not comply with, because Daniel Payne, who was
paying his addresses to Miss Rogers, was a very dissipa-
ted man, and the family treated him very coldly, and on
reflection he determined to remain home, and did so all
day. On Sunday, the 25th, Archibald Padley remained
in the same house in John street all day, with the excep-
tion of the evening, when he went to the Battery with<!-- Padley went with Padley. -->
Padley, and from thence to Atlantic Garden and also to
No. 127 Cedar street, where deponent slept.
   The next day Mr. C. heard she was missing; on Tues-
day he heard the same, and on Wednesday he was shown
the advertisement, and thought there was something se-
rious in it, or that she was either at Mrs. Downing's or at
Mrs. Hayes. Mr. C. then says he felt uneasy because he
had not called, owing to the circumstance that when he
left Mrs. Rogers' house he told Mary that he was sorry for
the step she was about taking, and that if she was ever
in trouble, to call on him. Mr. C. says he then went and
saw Mrs. Rogers with Payne sitting in the room. Payne
left when <u>Cromelin</u> went in, which <u>Cromelin</u> thought
singular at the time, and asked Mrs. Rogers what sent
Payne off in such a hurry. She replied, he had gone to
Bellevue to look after Mary. After having heard Mrs.
Rogers' story, he, <u>Cromelin</u>, concluded that Mary was
forcibly detained in some assignation house, or some
other place and came off to the Police Office to one Hays,
but did not see him. He then left the office, and called
at a small public house, opposite the <u>Shakspeare</u>, and <u>left
word that he was going over to Hoboken</u> along with
Archibald <u>Pedley</u> to look for Marry.
   They went over and walked up by the side of the river,
when they saw a number of people looking at a drowned
female, which they recognized as the body of Mary Ro-
gers. Mr. C. says he staid until the inquest was over, and
took home a piece of the skirt of her dress, and the Doctor
gave him the flowers from out of Mary's hat. One of her
garters, the bottom of her pantalette, a shoe, and a lock
of her hair, which he gave to Mrs. Rogers, who recog-
nized them all.
   The body was above the cave at Hoboken. Mr. C. found
the ferry that night to be shut, and walked to Jersey City,
but being unable to get across there, he slept at New Jer-
sey and returned in the morning. At the request of Mrs.
Rogers he re-crossed to Hoboken, to have an interview
with Dr. Cook, who had written to Dr. Beck, to meet
them there. At this meeting it was deemed necessary in
consequence of the heat of the weather to temporarily
inter the body.
   Henry <u>Mallen</u>, of 333 Broadway, and James M. <u>Boulard</u>,
of <u>321</u> Broadway, stated that, being at Hoboken on the
28th of July, they saw a body floating between two
tides, and about three hundred yards from the shore.—
They procured a boat, rowed to the body and brought it
to she shore. It proved to be a female, and they under-
stood it was Miss Rogers. When found, it was free
from rope, cord or any thing attached to it. There were
no rings, breastpin or jewelry on her person.
   William H. <u>Kukuck</u>, the sailor, states that he boarded
with Mrs. Rogers about a year back for two weeks and a
half. Left there and went on board the U. S. cutter Ha-
milton, Captain <u>Sturges</u>, at Boston, was discharged last
June, and came to this city about the 3d July. Called at
Mrs. Rogers, saw Mary, and had a conversation with her.
At this time he boarded with his sister, Mrs. <u>Noon</u>, in
Ludlow street. Has not spoken to either Mrs. Rogers or
her daughter since the 3d of July. He stayed with his
sister about nine or ten days, and went to New Bedford,
where he stayed about a week, and went to see a young
woman and came back to the city in a steamboat, and ar-
rived here on the 24th of July, and went to his sister's in
Ludlow street. While at New Bedford his clothes were
stolen, and he arrived here without a jacket or vest to
wear.
   On the 27th he shipped on board the North Carolina.—
He received a jacket at the shipping office in Water st.—
He slept at his sister's in Ludlow street on the night of the
24th; took breakfast and left the house a short time after
10 o'clock; went to a Mrs. Anderson's in 17th street and
staid until 11 o'clock, and then went to the <u>8th</u> avenue;
met a person called John Miller, who was watering a horse.
After he had finished, both went then to the North river
and took a bathe, and from there to a porter house and
got something to drink; he then left Miller and went to
his sister's, and after staying a short time went to the foot
of Barclay street, and then to Courtlandt street and home
to his sister's. In the evening <u>Kukuck</u> says he went to
Centre Market and to <u title="Now Jackson?">Walnut</u> street, and slept at Ludlow
street. The next morning, the 26th, went to the ship-
ping rendezvous, but was too late, and returned home,
<i>told his sister</i> he had shipped to go on board the North
Carolina; went next to a sailor boarding house kept by
Robinson in Water street. He took tea at Robinson's and
on the following morning went with Robinson and ship-
ped. He then went up town, or rather to the Five Points
—went to bed with a girl; after that to the rendezvous,
got some clothes, and went on board the North Carolina,
it being about one o'clock.
   Archibald W. Padley, the person spoken of in <u>Crome-
lin</u>'s statement, corroborated that gentleman's story in
every particular.
   The only part of this statement which need to be copied
verbatim is the concluding. Mr. Padley boarded with
Mrs. Rogers and knew Mary. He left in June last. On
the 23d July Mr. C. showed Padley a note from Mrs.
Rogers, requesting him to call at her house, but did not
state what for. On Saturday the 24th of July, Padley
saw the name of <i>Miss Rogers written on Mr. C.'s slate,
and also saw a rose put in the key hole of his room at the
same time</i>.
   <u title="Phoebe">Pheobe</u> Rogers says she has seen the dress taken from
the body, and that it is the clothing of Mary Cecilia
Rogers, and the same she wore on Sunday, the 25th of
July.</m9>

		[COMMUNICATED.]
   Moses Y. Beach, Esq.—In your paper of this
day an editorial article on the fifth column very
emphatically, and in a very harsh and ungenerous
manner, condemns the laudable enterprise of rais-
ing by subscription a sum of money to be offered
as a means, if possible, of ferreting out the wretch
or wretches whose hands are stained with the in-
nocent blood of the unfortunate Miss Mary C.
Rogers—a more foul and disgraceful murder than
which is not in the whole catalogue of crime.—
Now, sir, as a daily reader of your paper, and one
not wishing to be <i>guzzled</i>, allow me to ask, where
is the sincerity or consistency of your course, that
while condemning, if you please, the raising by
subscription the sum of money as above, you
yourself have subscribed to that very fund, and
your name may be found published in the list of
subscribers—by a reference to the Herald of this
day. How do you explain yourself?		Q<small>UERY</small>.
   R<small>EPLY</small>.—This particularly courteous communi-
cation can be fully replied to, in very few words.
In the first place the writer deceives himself in
regarding our remarks yesterday on this subject
as a “harsh and ungenerous” condemnation of
the <i>enterprise</i> in question. We said not a word
against the <i>enterprise</i>; we only said that the most
graceless vagabonds in our city had intruded
themselves into a prominent position in it; and
that, too, for sinister motives. This is true to the
letter, and we repeat it even more emphatically
than we yesterday asserted it. But of this, more
anon.
   In the second place, and lastly, the name refer-
red to by the writer of the above epistle, if it is on
the list at all, was never put there by the proprie-
tor of this paper, nor with his knowledge nor con-
sent;—consequently, it can be nothing more nor
less than <i>a rank forgery</i>. So Mr. “Query” has a
full explanation of all he asks.
   But “while our hand is in,” we will, with his
permission, add a few words “on our own hook.”
We will ask him to look at the proceedings of the
meeting held on Wednesday evening, ostensibly
to promote this “enterprise.” He appears to have
seen the report, and it is to be presumed he is
aware of the character of the print in which it ap-
pears;—for not a second one could be found in
the city that would disgrace its columns by and
insertion of it.
   The first thing that will strike his attention is
the organization of the meeting. The report says
the meeting was “numerous and highly respecta-
ble,” and was organized by William H. Attree,
who called the meeting to order and appointed the
officers. How “highly respectable” it <i>must</i> have
been! Having got his preciously “numerous and
highly respectable” meeting so far, this same mas-
ter of ceremonies, Attree, says he “<i>eloquently</i> <u>ad-</u>
addressed the meeting,” and “offered the follow-
ing preamble and resolutions, which were unani-
mously adopted,” &c. “Mr. Attree” then pro-
ceeded and did all the other business of this pre-
cious meeting, and concluded by “Resolving una-
nimously that the proceedings be published in all
the city papers.” How they <i>did</i> publish them!—
Why there is not another paper in the city besides
the organ of the miserable scamp who <i>drummed up</i>,
organized, and <i>used up</i> this meeting, that would ad-
mit the report in its columns on any considera-
tion! His very name alone would prevent the re-
solved publication from being made in any print,
even though but tolerably decent and respectable,
in the city; but when to the odiousness of his own
name he adds that attached to some others paraded
in the committee he appointed to act ostensibly
with him, but in reality <i>for</i> him—and themselves
a little—the very idea of publishing “in all the
city papers” is as amusing as it is preposterous
and impudent.
   The every-where-acknowledged-vagabond, and
no-where-tolerated scamp, who came from the
gutters of Grub street, (and had a narrow escape
from Bow street, at that,) to regulate the affairs of
our city, in his “unanimously adopted” preamble,
says for himself and for his officers and meeting,
that “without desiring to cast unnecessary <i>censure</i>
upon any of the authorities, they <i>deprecate</i> the ap-
parent apathy that has characterized the Chief
Magistrates of the States of New Jersey and New
York, and the authorities of the county of New
York.”!!
   Shade of the Penningtons, the Clintons, the
Morses, what a spectacle is this! To what a
pass has society arrived in this city, when really
<i>decent citizens</i> can be wheedled into a company,
and be trumpeted forth as a “numerous and highly
respectable meeting,” held to enable a foreign va-
gabond, fresh from the stews and gutters of London
—an unwashed, bloated, besotted, degraded, dis-
graced, and universally despised fugitive from the
London police, to thus insult them, their fellow
citizens, their laws, their institutions, and their
“Chief Magistrates.”!! The thing out-Herods
Herod! Is it to be wondered at, that after re-
ceiving the countenance and aid of Roderick N.
Morrison, and two or three other decent men, in
<i>such</i> an “enterprise,” (as “Query” calls it,) the
wretch should push his audacity a little further,
and demand of all the city papers promulgation
through their columns, of his infamous and auda-
cious insults? And is it strange his demand was as
indignantly repelled by the city press, as his in-
trusion into the company of their conductors,
would be? We apprehend a further reply is un-
necessary.

   ☞ We received yesterday no less than seven-
teen communications relative to the all-exciting
case of Miss Rogers, each of which propounded
to us one or more questions, all varying in the ob-
ject which appeared to enlist the special interest
of the enquirer. To answer them all, if it was in
our power to do so, would occupy a large portion
of our paper; but it is entirely <i>out</i> of our power—
for the reason that, not being gifted with the pro-
perties of omnipresence, nor even of clairvoyance,
we are no better informed in reference to the
causes and effects enquired about, than any one
else who will take the trouble to read the public
papers.

		POLICE OFFICE—Y<small>ESTERDAY</small>.
			<m9>[Reported for the Sun.]</m9>
   T<small>HE</small> H<small>OBOKEN</small> M<small>URDER</small>.—The police authori-
ties were busily occupied yesterday in the inves-
tigation of this affair, and we present our anxious
readers with the results of their labors, in the fol-
lowing affidavits. We may state that the clothing
in which the mangled body was wrapped, were
yesterday fully identified as that worn by the ill-
fated Mary Rogers, by her mother, aunt, and
an intimate female friend.
   Alfred Crommelin, of No. 19 John street, being
duly sworn, deposes and says that he went to
Mrs. <u title="Phoebe">Phœbe</u> Rogers' house to board on the 7th
Dec., 1840, and remained there until about the
first of June last, and that during that time a
daughter of Mrs. Rogers, Mary Cecilia, had the
superintendence of the whole house. Deponent
did not visit the house after he took away his bag-
gage. That three days previous to the 25th of
July Mrs. Rogers or her daughter Mary called eve-
ry day for the purpose of seeing deponent, and left
a note for him to call on them at their residence
in Nassau street, which request deponent did
not comply with, although it was his intention to
do so on Sunday the 25th July following, for the
following reasons:—that Daniel Payne, who was
paying his attentions to Miss Mary, was a very
dissipated man, and the family treated him very
coldly, and on reflection he determined to remain
home, and did so all day on Sunday the 25th. Ar-
chibald Padley remained in the same house in
John street all day, with the exception of the eve-
ning, when he went in company with Padley to<!-- Padley went with Padley. -->
the Battery, and from thence to the Atlantic Gar-
den, and from thence to 127 Cedar street, where
deponent slept.
   On Monday, the 26th July he heard that Mary
was missing; on Tuesday he heard the same, and
on Wednesday morning he was shown the ad-
vertisement in the newspaper; when deponent
read the same he believed that there was some-
thing serious in it, for previously he thought she
was up at her cousin's, <u>Mr.</u> Downing's or <u title="Mrs. Hayes?">Mr.
<s>Hog's</s></u>; deponent then felt extremely sorry that he
had not called upon her, owing to the circumstance
that when he left Mrs. Roger's house he told Ma-
ry that if ever she was in trouble to call on him.
I then went immediately to Mrs. Roger's home
and saw her and Payne sitting in the room. Payne
left the home in a hurry; asked what took him
off, and Mrs. Rogers said he had gone to Bellevue
to look after Mary. After I had heard the story
from Mrs. Rogers I left, and concluded in my own
mind that Mary was forcibly detained in some
assignation house or some other place, and from
thence went immediately to the police office,
and intended to have seen young Hays, the police
officer, knowing there was such a man by reputa-
tion as an able officer, but on enquiry did not see
him. I then left the office, and called at a little
tavern opposite the <u>Shakspeare</u> Hotel, as I under-
stood that Mrs. Rogers had received a note that
Mary had been seen there on Sunday, the <s>????</s>
25th July. I understood that a girl had been there,
that did not answer Mary's description. I then
went down to Mrs. Rogers', and told them I was
going over to Hoboken, New Jersey, to look for
her, which I did that afternoon, (July 28th,) in com-
pany with Archibald Padley; went the river walk,
up along shore, saw a number of people standing
on the shore; asked the cause, and was told it was
the body of a drowned female, on looking at
which I recognized it to be that of Miss Mary C.
Rogers. I remained with the body all the after-
noon until the Coroner had taken an inquest,
<d>[Col.6]</d>
which was at nearly 9 o'clock at night—deponent
took a part of the skirt of her dress, and a piece
from off the sleeve. Doctor Cook, who was asso-
ciated with the Coroner, gave him the flowers
from outside and inside of Mary's hat, a garter, the
bottom of her pantalettes, a shoe, and a lock or
curl of her hair, which deponent brought over to
Mary's mother, and all of which were recognized
by her and the family. Her body was found a
little above the cave, at Hoboken—the ferry at
that time, nearly eleven o'clock, being closed,
deponent walked to the Jersey City Ferry,
and found that was also closed, when he
slept at the city of New Jersey that night
and crossed early in the morning. At the
request of Mrs. Rogers and her family, deponent
recrossed to Hoboken the next morning, having
the evening previous made an arrangement with
the Coroner and Dr. Cook to meet them for the
purpose of a further examination. Dr. Cook had
written a note to Dr. Beck of New York to meet
them there, but business prevented him from so
doing—deponent further says that when he first
saw the body he cut her sleeve open and rubbed
her arm for the purpose of identifying her, and
also made use of every proper means for the
same purpose—deponent further says that at the
meeting between the Coroner, Dr. Cook and himself
at Hoboken on the morning after the inquest, it
was deemed necessary, in consequence of the
great heat of the weather, to temporarily inter her
body, which was done at two feet from the sur-
face of the earth, and in a double coffin.<a id="Sun-1841-08-13-Archibald-Padley"></a>
   Archibald W. Padley was likewise examined.—
He corroborated the statements of Crommelin,
and also stated that on the 23d of July Crommelin
showed him a note from Mrs. Rogers, requesting
Crommelin to call at her house, without stating
the particular business—that on Saturday, the
24th he saw Miss Rogers' name written on Crom-
melin's slate, and also a rose which had been
<u title="placed">placced</u> in the keyhole of the door.
   We add the following affidavit, made by one of
the persons who first discovered the body at Ho-
boken:
   Henry Mallin, of 333 Broadway, deposes that
on Wednesday, the 28th of July, between 3 and 4
o'clock in the afternoon, he was at Hoboken in
company with James M. <u>Boulard</u>, and that whilst
walking on the river walk just above the cave,
they discovered a body floating between two
tides, between two and three hundred yards from
the shore, when deponent ran as far as the Elysian
Fields dock, in company with said <u>Boulard</u>, and
procured a boat, rowed to said body, and brought
it to the shore, which body proved to be that of a
female, and who deponent understands to be that
of Mary Cecilia Rogers, that when said body was
found it was perfectly free, without rope, cord,
or anything attached to the same, that <u title="there">they</u> were
no rings, breastpin, or any other jewelry on her
person.
   This affidavit is fully corroborated by Mr. <u>Bou-
lard</u>.

   E<small>XAMINATION IN THE CASE OF</small> M<small>ISS</small> R<small>OGERS</small>.—
William H. <u>Kiekuck</u>, seaman on board the United
States ship North Carolina, being examined, stated
that about a year since he boarded with Mrs. Ro-
gers, in Nassau street, for two and a half weeks,
and then left and joined the United States Revenue
Cutter Hamilton, at Boston, and was discharged
from her the end of last June, and came to this
city 3d July, and went again to Mrs. Rogers,
where he saw Mary C. Rogers, having previously
known her. Deponent at this time boarded with
his sister Moore, in Ludlow street, and has never
seen or spoken to Mrs. Rogers, or her daughter,
Mary, since the above mentioned 3d July. Depo-
nent staid with his sister nine or ten days, and then
went to New Bedford, where he remained about a
week; went there to see a young woman and came
back to this city in a steamboat, and arrived the
24th July last, again stopping with his sister in
Ludlow street. His clothes were stolen from him
while in New Bedford, and when he arrived in this
city he had neither jacket <u>or</u> vest to wear. On the
27th July, he shipped and went on board the Uni-
ted States ship North Carolina, received a jacket at
the shipping office at the time he shipped, in
Water street. Deponent slept at his sister's in
Ludlow street, on the night of the 24th July, took
breakfast and left her house a little after 10 o'clock,
and went to his sister's-in-law, Mrs. Anderson, in
Seventeenth street, near Broadway. Left there a
little after 11 A. M.; went to <u>Ninth</u> Avenue near
Seventeenth street, and met a person called John
Miller, and soon after went with him to the North
river at the foot of Twenty first street; walked
down the river a short distance and took a bath;
went to a porter house near Thirteenth street and
got some drink. There left Miller, and returned
to Mrs. Moore's, his sister's. Soon after went to
the foot of Barclay street, thence to Courtlandt
street, and then to Mrs. Moore's in Ludlow street,
took supper and went to Centre market, kept by
Charles Reynolds, there met his brother, got some
drink, and went to the Hook in <u title="Now Jackson?">Walnut</u> street, and
after being there a short time returned to Mrs.
Moore's in Ludlow street, and retired to bed. On
the morning of the 26th July went to the shipping
rendezvous, but was too late, the doctor not being
there; returned home and told Mrs. Moore that he
has shipped on board the North Carolina. Be-
tween 12 and 1 o'clock dined; left home telling
his sister he was going on board; went to Robin-
son's sailor boarding house, in Water street, and
engaged board; talked with shipmates; took
tea at <u>Robinsyn</u>'s about seven o'clock; then took a
walk and stopped at no particular place; returned
at ten o'clock and went to bed. Next morning he
conversed at Robinson's door; went to the shipping
office and shipped; then went to the Five Points;
returned to the rendezvous, got some clothes, and
went on board the North Carolina, it being then
about one o'clock.
   Henry Mallin, of No. 333 Broadway, deposed,
that on Wednesday, the 28th July, between three
and four o'clock, P. M. he was at Hoboken, in com-
pany with James M. <u>Boullard</u>, and while walking
on the river walk, just above the cave, they dis-
covered a body floating between two tides, between
two and three hundred yards from the shore, when
deponent ran as far as the Elysian Field's Dock, in
company with said <u>Boullard</u>, and procured a boat,
rowed to said body, brought it to the shore, and
placed it on the beach; which body proved to be
that of a female, and which deponent understood
to be that of Mary Cecilia Rogers. That when
said body was found it was perfectly free, without
rope, cord, or any thing attached to it; there were
no rings, breast pin, or any other jewelry on her
person.
   James M. <u>Boullard</u>, of No. <u>321</u> Broadway, cor-
roborated every thing in the statement of Mr. Mal-
lin.
   Alfred Crommelin, of No. 19 John street, de-
posed, that he boarded with Mrs. Rogers, 126 Nas-
sau street, from the 7th December, 1840, to the 1st
June last, and that Mary C. Rogers had the whole
house during the time he was there.
   Deponent did not visit the house after he took
away his baggage. That three days prior to the
25th July, Mrs. Rogers or her daughter Mary called
every day to the deponent's, and left a note for him
signed by Mrs. Rogers, although the body of the
same was written by Miss Rogers, requesting him
to call on them at their residence in Nassau street,
which request deponent did not comply with, al-
though it was his intention to do so on Sunday, the
25th of July following, for the following reasons—
that Daniel Payne, who was paying his attentions
to Miss Mary, was a very dissipated man, and that
the family had treated deponent very <u title="coldly">cooly</u>, and on
reflection he determined to remain at home, and
did so all day, on Sunday the 25th. Archibald
Padley remained in the same house in John street
all day, with the exception of the evening, when
deponent went in company with Padley to the Bat-
tery—thence to the Atlantic Garden, and thence to
127 Cedar street, where deponent slept.
   On Monday, the 26th, he heard that Mary was
missing; on Tuesday heard the same; and on Wed-
nesday morning he was shown the advertisement.
When deponent read the same he believed there
was something serious about it, for previously he
thought that she was up at her cousins, Mrs. Dow-
ning's, or Mrs. Hayes. Deponent then felt ex-
tremely sorry he had not called to see her, owing to
the circumstance that when he left Mrs. Rogers'
house, deponent told Mary he was sorry for the step
she was about taking, and that if she was ever in
trouble to call on him. Deponent then went im-
mediately to her house, and saw Mrs. Rogers and
Daniel Payne, sitting in the room. Payne left the
house when deponent came in, which deponent
thought was very singular at the time. Deponent
asked Mrs. Rogers what sent him off in such a hur-
ry. She said he had gone to Bellevue to look after
Mary.
   After deponent had heard the story from the old
lady, he left and concluded in his own mind that
Mary was forcibly detained in some assignation
house, or some other place, and came immediately
up to the police office, and intended to have seen
young <u>Hayes</u>, the police officer; but on enquiry,
did not see him. Deponent then left the office and
went to a small tavern opposite <u>Shakspeare</u> Hotel,
as he understood that Mrs. Rogers had received a
note that Mary had been seen there on Sunday,
25th July. Understood that a girl had been there,
from the landlord, called Alman, at about 2 o'clock,
which did not answer Mary's description. Depo-
nent then returned to Mrs. Rogers, and told them
he was going over to Hoboken to look for her, which
he did that afternoon, in company with Archibald
Padley,—went the river walk along the shore, and
saw a number of people on the shore—asked the
cause, received for answer, that it was the body of
a drowned female. On looking at the person, de-
ponent recognized the body to be that of Miss Mary
C. Rogers. Remained with the body all the after-
noon, until the Coroner had taken an inquest,
which was at nearly 9 o'clock at night. Deponent
took a part of the skirt of her dress, and a piece
from off the sleeve.
   Doctor Cook, who was associated with the Coro-
ner, gave him the flowers from inside and outside
of Mary's hat, a garter, the bottom of her panta-
lette, a shoe, and a curl of her hair, which depo-
nent brought over to Mary's mother, and all of
which was recognized by her and the family. Her
body was found a little above the cave at Hoboken.
The ferry at Hoboken at this time, nearly 11 o'-
clock at night, being closed, deponent walked to
the Jersey City Ferry, and found that was also
closed, when he slept at the Jersey City Hotel
that night, and crossed early in the morning. At
the request of Mrs. Rogers and her family, depo-
nent re-crossed to Hoboken the next morning—
having the evening previous made an arrangement
<d>[Col.4]</d>
with the Coroner and Doctor Cook, to meet them
for the purpose of a further examination. Doctor
Cook had written a letter to Doctor Beck, of New
York, to meet them there, but business prevented
him from so doing. Deponent further says, that
when he first saw the body he cut her sleeve open,
and rubbed her arm for the purpose of identifying
her, and also made use of every proper means for
the same purpose. Deponent also says, that at the
meeting between the Coroner, Doctor Cook and
himself at Hoboken, on the morning after the in-
quest was held on Mary's body, it was deemed ne-
cessary, in consequence of the great heat of the wea-
ther, to temporarily inter the body, which was
done, at two feet from the surface of the earth, and
in a double coffin.
   Archibald W. Padley of No. 19 John street, cor-
roborated the statements of Mr. Crommelin, as far
as he was concerned and in company with him.—
In addition he stated that on the 23d of July last
Mr. Crommelin showed him a note from Miss Ro-
gers, requesting him to call at her house, but did
not state what the particular business was. On
Saturday, the 24th of July, last, he saw the name
of Miss Rogers written on Mr. Crommelin's slate,
and also a rose put in the key hole of his door at
the same time.
   <u id="Evening-Post-1841-08-13-Mrs-Rogers" title="Phoebe">Phœbe</u> Rogers, of No. 126 Nassau street, depo-
sed that she has this day seen the dress, now in the
police office, taken from the person of a drowned
female at Hoboken, and that it is the clothing of
her daughter, Mary <u>Cecelia</u> Rogers, who had the
same on her person when she left her house on
Sunday morning, the 25th of July last.—<i>Express</i>.

Office yesterday, parts of the dress taken from the body
of this unfortunate girl were identified by her mother,
aunt, and a young female acquaintance, as the dress
which she wore on the day she left home. The two
young men who found the body were re-examined, but
nothing elicited beyond what has already been publish-

   T<small>HE</small> M<small>URDER OF</small> M<small>ARY</small> C. R<small>OGERS</small>.—Nearly
three weeks have now elapsed, since the murder
of this girl, and yet there is no discovery of the
murderer, nor indeed, any clue or suspicion as to
who he is. The probability is, she was decoyed
into some one of the New York assignation hou-
ses and violated, and then to conceal that crime,
murdered and thrown into the Hudson on the Ho-
boken side. What was the mortal agony of that
poor girl, in her extremity, no mind can conceive,
It cannot be that such crimes shall go undiscov-
ered.

   ☞ The Investigation of the Murder of Miss Rogers was
actively prosecuted yesterday at both the Police Offices. A
great number of persons were examined, but nothing impor-
tant elicited. The Police have strong hopes, however, that
a clue to the murder is not far off.
   The impression gains strength among those best informed
that the unfortunate woman was not murdered at Hoboken
but in this City. Such is our opinion. How could she, so
well known, have visited Hoboken on a fair Sunday without
being recognized? No! her life was taken in some den of
infamy in this City. More anon.

   ☞ The Sun of yesterday had a very unwarrantable attack on the
Meeting at Stoneall's on Wednesday evening last to aid the discov-
ery of the Murderers of Miss Rogers. Mr. Attree can defend himself
—but why assail others?—As to Mr. Beach's denial that he subscribed
$2 toward the Reward offered, it is a miserable evasion. <i>The $2 was
subscribed by his son in the presence and by the direction of Beach</i>.
How paltry, then, to assert that <i>he</i> did not subscribe, and pronounce

   <i>The Case of Miss Rogers</i>.—In the course of yes-
terday the Mayor examined two more witnesses, up-
on the subject of this outrage, but their testimony
was of no importance except to clear up some doubts
which remained upon some of the evidence previous-
ly taken. No new arrests have been made, nor have
any new facts been developed.
   At the Upper Police Office the magistrates and of-
ficers have been very actively engaged in this affair.
Several arrests have been made, but no new facts
have been discovered. Until something more <u title="definite">defi-
nate</u> is brought to light, the authorities have request-
ed that no more publications be made, as they tend to
keep up a feverish excitements in the public mind.
   The Grand Jury, which adjourned on Thursday,
have discharged all the complaints against Isaac J.
Wood, so that he stands now where he did previous
to his first arrest, with the exception that he is about
$12,000 out of pocket, that sum having been taken
from him at the Police Office and paid over to the
third hands.
   Officers Baily and Horne last evening brought up
a man named Andrew Myers, a married man, who
keeps a vegetable market stand in Washington mar-
ket, charged with attempting to commit a rape on a
little girl aged 12 or 13 years of age, who lived in
the same house with himself in Washington street,
near Barclay. He was held to bail to answer the
charge.

<m9>		[From the Journal of Commerce.]
   The great excitement now prevailing in this city with
regard to the violation and murder of Miss Rogers, must
not be allowed to die away without producing some be-
neficial result to the morals and safety of the citizens of
our beloved commonwealth.
   Look, if you please, to the history of our unfortunate
city for the last five years, and is not the page which re-
cords the events of that space of time, black with the
stains of <u title="guilt">gilt</u> and crime? Crimes of the worst descrip-
tion have been committed, and are still unrevenged.
What punishment fell to the lot of those “round-rimmer
rowdies” who attacked the dwelling-house of Mr. Tap-
pan, and burned his furniture; or to the violators of the
house of religion in Chatham street; or to the sacrilegious
ruffians who destroyed Mr. Ludlow's church in Spring
street; or to the soap lock sackers of Mr. Hart's store; or
to the murderer of Ellen Jewett; or to the rowdy who
murdered the poor watchman at a gambling house in the
Bowery, whose butchered victim is yet unavenged; or
to the villain who killed the watchman in <a href="http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47e0-d6c8-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99">Coffee House</a>
<a href="http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/5e66b3e8-b347-d471-e040-e00a180654d7">slip</a>? Ezra White is still unhung, and the gallows has
been cheated of its due. What attempts were ever made
to arrest the “Hook rowdies,” who entered the house of
a German in Grand Street, on a New Year's eve, and rav-
ished his daughter—(a poor deaf and dumb girl)—before
the eyes of his family? During this same night, a gen-
tleman who was walking towards home with his wife,
was assaulted and shamefully beaten in a public street
(the Bowery,) his wife forced away from him and viola-
ted, by the same gang of ravishers, and not one of them
has ever been arrested.
   The National Theatre has been twice burned down
from the act of incendiaries, and the last time a young
girl was crushed beneath the smoking ruins—and the
person accused of the crime, and against whom suspi-
cion is very strong, has never been tried—our city has
been disgraced by the villanies of pipe layers, procurers
of illegal voters, perjurers, forgers, bank robbers, swin-
dlers, ravishers, murderers, burners, burglars, thieves,
and watch stuffers, the most of whom are well known to
the police magistrates, and are the friends and compan-
ions of police officers, and are protected by the-stool-pi-
geon system. Are not these facts? It is unsafe and dan-
gerous for a female to walk the streets alone by day or
night. Can any man say that his life and his property
are his own, and not liable to be taken from him every
hour? Nothing is safe from the outrages of these ruf-
fians. And why have we no protection from the city
government? Let a public meeting be called; men of
influence and standing in the community are ready and
willing to join a movement of the kind. Whenever the
citizens rise in their strength, they can always gain
their object if it be a worthy one, and surely the safety
of our lives and property may be properly so denomina-
ted. Let us have a reform in the police system.</m9>
   There will be no confidence in the administration
of justice here till such judges as Noah and Lynch
are expelled from the bench, and our Police system
be re-organized on the day and night preventive
method.

<d>[Col.2]</d>
   A<small>NOTHER</small> E<small>XTRAORDINARY</small> O<small>CCURENCE</small>.—C<small>ASE
OF</small> <u title="'Melinda' in Tribune-1841-08-07">M<small>ATILDA</small></u> H<small>OAG</small>.—This woman has been long
known by the police to be most abandoned pros-
titute, in the employment of a man who, through
her agency, picks the pockets of her victims, under
circumstances that prevent prosecutions, and em-
boldens them in the continuance of these abomina-
ble practices.
   The law declares that “<i>all common prostitutes who
have no lawful employment, whereby to maintain them-
selves, are vagrants</i>,” and may, on conviction, be sent
to the Alms House or Penitentiary for six months.
Justice Matsell, after much labor and the examina-
tion of several witnesses, interrupted by a habeas
corpus, allowed by his Honor the Recorder, and ano-
ther by his Honor Judge Lynch, consented, at the
request of the counsel of Matilda, to associate with
him in the proceeding his Honor the Recorder.
Jusice Matsell, with the knowledge and approval
of the Recorder, convicted her of the offence upon
clear evidence, and committed her to the keeper of
the Penitentiary. Before she could be conveyed to
the place assigned, Judge Lynch granted another
habeas corpus, upon which she was brought before
him; and in order to give greater dignity to the pro-
ceeding, the Recorder was associated with Judge
Lynch.
   The commitment shows that she was convicted of
being “<i>a vagrant, viz: an idle person and a common
prostitute, who, not having visible means to maintain
herself, lives without lawful employment</i>.” This
learned judge refers to the Revised Statutes, §1, tit.
2 of chap. 20 of part 1st, to show that “<i>all idle per-
sons who, not having visible means to maintain them-
selves, live without employment</i>,” are vagrants. Now
this had nothing to do with the question before him.
He might have as well referred to the Koran. She
had been convicted under the Statute of 1833, and
the only question was, whether the commitment
showed that. Now he says, “<i>it is obvious that the
offence charged is made up partly of a charge under
one and partly under the other of those laws</i>.” With
all due deference to the accurate discrimination of
the Judge, no such thing is obvious. It is true that
every common prostitute who supports herself by
the wages of her sin, is an “idle person, not having
visible means to maintain herself, and lives without
(<i>lawful</i>) employment;” but it is not true that every
idle person within this last description is a common
prostitute.
   The attempt here at mystification is so palpable,
that we pass on to other parts of this learned deci-
sion.
   It appears that the District Attorney had given this
case some attention, and puzzled the Judge with the
maxim, “<u title="“What is useful is not vitiated by the useless.”">utile per inutile non vitiatur</u>.” To rid
himself of its application, he attempts to render the
effort ludicrous. He then supposes that officer pro-
posed to strike from the commitment all the words
that describe the offence, so as to leave an absurdity.
Take the law and commitment, and compare them.
Strike out from the commitment the words italicised,
as proposed by the District Attorney, and compared
with the law, and it stands thus:—
<m9><table style="white-space:normal"><tr><td align=center valign=top>C<small>OMMITMENT</small>.</td><td align=center>L<small>AW</small>.</td></tr>
<tr style="white-space:pre"><td style="padding-right:1em">“A vagrant, viz: <i>an idle
person and</i> a common pros-
titute who, not having <i>visi-
ble</i> means to maintain her-
self, lives without lawful
employment.”</td><td valign=top>“All common prostitutes
who have no lawful em-
ployment whereby to main-
tain themselves, are va-
grants.”</td></tr></table></m9>
   Now what would this learned Theban have?
The words here proposed to be stricken out, would
not vary the conviction; to say that a vagrant is an
idle person, does not weaken the charge—nor does
it make it different—he not only says that she is a
vagrant, but he says that she is of the class of com-
mon prostitutes; and is not only so, but has no visi-
ble means to maintain herself, and lives without
lawful employment. The clear manner in which
the proposition was put by the District Attorney, is
here so apparent, that his honor stands convicted of
a vain and puerile attempt to get rid of the applica-
tion of a clear rule of law. That the useful is not
vitiated by the useless, is here so clear, that “he
who runs, may read it.” The rule of law, as well as
of common sense, in relation to commitments, is,
that it shall contain a clear but succinct statement
of the offence. A more gross and palpable miscon-
struction of plain English has not been perpetrated
within our recollection.
   We now come to the cream of this opinion.
Hear it, oh! ye goddesses—publish it at the “Five
Points,” tell it at the “Hook.” “Now,” says the
learned judge, “a common prostitute, who lives
without employment, but who <i>has</i> means to main-
tain herself, is clearly not within the statute.” Illu-
minate your houses, and build bon-fires, for this
legal grant. Judge Lynch has decided that all of
you, aye, all of you who <i>have</i> means (no matter
how acquired) to maintain yourselves, have the
freedom of the city.
   The remainder of this opinion will be the subject
of a future notice.

   T<small>HE</small> M<small>ARY</small> R<small>OGERS</small> M<small>YSTERY</small>.—Yesterday morning
his Honor the Mayor sent to the police office for the
papers, affidavits, examinations, <i><u>et cetra</u></i>, which had
been taken before the Police Magistrates, for the
purpose of recommencing the investigation himself,
and putting his veto on the immediate publication of
such testimony as might be collected—unless some-
thing positive or definite could be arrived at, or some
person so far implicated that his detention became
an imperative duty. We saw his Honor at the close
of business, and he informed us that he had taken
some testimony, but that it did not clear up the mys-
tery, although it had tended to relieve his mind of a
suspicion he had entertained of some one individual,
who, his Honor did not say.
   The probabilities of Mary Rogers having commit-
ted suicide have been much discussed in well inform-
ed quarters, and by official persons, who had oppor-
tunities of seeing the remains after the exhumation.
The Coroner, Dr. Archer, thinks the post mortem
examination not sufficiently minute or critical to de-
cide the point, and he is fortified in his opinion by
the fact, that every dead body found in the rivers ad-
jacent to this city appears at first sight to have died
from violence. Then it is said that her family were
very poor, the furniture of the house had just been
sold for rent, the boarders had all left, and she had
no prospect but that of marrying a man, said to be—
we know on what authority—a very dissipated
character.
   On the presumption of her murder, we have the
positive opinion of the Hoboken physicians at the in-
quest. The fact that she was of cheerful disposi-
tion, and not ignorant of the ways of the world, and
had been occupied as sales woman in a cigar shop,
by which occupation she had formerly supported her-
self and mother. The absence of her finger rings, if
she had any, we do not think a fact bearing either
way, for every body knows, that a finger immersed
in water will diminish in bulk. They may have been
lost in the water, or not have been in her possession
on the fatal Sunday. We are yet inclined to think
that she was ruthlessly and barbarously ravished and
murdered. That it was done in this city by some of
the soaplocks or volunteer fire rowdies, and who ei-
ther by force or fraud got her into some of the En-
gine houses adjacent to the North River, kept her
there all day, and at night, during the pelting of that
pitiless storm, they consigned her body to the North
River—either alive or dead. Two watchmen have
been found, and can be forthcoming at any time, who
will swear that they heard an awful groaning that
stormy night at the foot of Harrison street, N. R.—
They say they went to the spot, but beyond a sort of
gurgling, which might be the rain which was descend-
ing in torrents, and might have been the death strug-
gle of that neglected girl, they could neither see nor
hear <u>ought</u>.
   An Evening paper calls on the authorities for the
deliverance of <u>Kewkirh</u> the sailor, and the arrest of
Daniel Payne. This man's conduct has been singu-
larly unfeeling, and especially unlove like, but is there
not something equally mysterious in the reported be-
havior of <u>Cromelin</u>, and the lost girl? He admits
that she called on him, and wished him to see her
mother, and his friend swears that on the day before
this lost girl disappeared, <i>he saw the name of Miss Ro-
gers written on Mr. <u>Cromelin</u>'s slate, and also saw a
rose put in the key hole of his room at the same time</i>. If
she called on Saturday, may she not have called on
Sunday? Will his Honor the Mayor have this point
cleared up.

   C<small>ASE OF</small> M<small>ISS</small> R<small>OGERS</small>.—<u>Phe</u> Police are still ac-
tively engaged in endeavoring to <u title="ferret">ferrit</u> out the au-
thors of the horrid murder of this once lovely
young lady, but we regret to state, that as yet their
efforts have been of little apparent avail. Numer-
ous arrests have been made at both the Lower and
Upper <u>Poliice</u> Offices, and every person upon whom
the remotest suspicion has fallen, or those who
in any way were supposed to be able to state any
particulars concerning her, after her mysterious
disappearance, have been called before the Mayor
or the Police Magistrates, to detail under oath the
little they knew. The Mayor, Magistrates and
officers, notwithstanding all that their revilers may
assert to the contrary, have exhibited a commen-
dable zeal and unflagging industry, in seeking after
evidence and bringing before them persons and
parties to elicit information that would shed, if
possible, a ray of light on this dark and bloody
tragedy. It is deemed proper, by the authorities
having this matter in charge, to withhold the affi-
davits hereafter taken on this subject, from the
public, until the measures in train for the detec-
tion and arrest of the guilty parties are matured,
and the cruel culprits are within the grasp of jus-
tice. Hope of discovery brightens continually, and
it is not too much to predict, that the guilty, who-
ever they may be, will ere long be made known,
and that their “sin will find them out.” The be-
lief meanwhile increases that the murder was per-
petrated in some of the numerous dens of depravi-
ty in this city, and not in the neighborhood where
her lifeless body was found.—<i>Express</i>.

<h2>A Girl & 6 Men in a Boat;
Not Mary, Not Injured</h2>

================================================================
<d>[Col.1]</d>
   T<small>HE LATE MURDER</small>, of the “beautiful cigar girl,”
is still the subject of great excitement in N. York.—
No clue, has been, as yet, discovered, by which the
perpetrators can be discovered. The Evening Tattler
of that city, gives the communication of an anony-
mous correspondent, who says, that on the day which
is supposed to be the one, Miss Rogers was murder-
ed, he saw a boat land at Hoboken with a well dressed
girl and six men cross from N. Y.,—that a short time
after, another boat with three men, came from the
city, and made enquiry of two gentlemen, who wit-
nessed the crossing of the first boat, whether a girl
had been that way, and whether any force had been
used to detain her, &c. This is the substance of the
<u title="Tattler">Tatler</u> statement, and we think it carries improbability
on the face of it. It is no wise likely that six men
would decoy a young girl from her home in open day
light, to a place so public as Hoboken either for pur-
poses of revenge or violation. As base as the human
heart sometimes prove itself to be it can offer no <i>mo-
tive</i> why so dreadful a secret should be placed in the
keeping of so many individuals. If revenge, or dis-
honor was the object, one or two villains could attain
their end, as well as six, without half the risk of
detection. Again; it is improbable that Miss Rogers
would voluntarily accompany six men under the cir-
cumstances as related. If being in the boat was not
her own choice, these two gentlemen would have had
their attention called to it, as well as the hundreds of
people, who are continually wandering about Hobo-
ken and its neighborhood. Besides, the story is in-
credible from the fact as stated, that the second boat
was but a very short time behind the first; and they
immediately started in pursuit on the run. If the
three men in the last boat were friends, pursuing the
girl for protection, it is almost impossible that an
outrage or a murder could have been committed, with-
out their knowledge. If they were of the same gang
(which is alike improbable) why were they left behind,
only to add to the danger of detection. Our opinion
is, that the statement, so far as regards the murdered
girl, is inconsistent and improbable. If an All Wise
Providence should ever bring this foul murder to light,
we believe it will prove to be the work of but <small>ONE</small>
man.

   Since the above was in type, we gather the follow-
ing additional information, which is corroborative of
our opinion above. We think the probability stronger
that she was both violated and murdered in the city of
New York.

   In reference to the account published yesterday, of
a young woman having been taken out of a boat on
the river, by a party of six men from another boat, who
then rowed swiftly to the Hoboken shore and there
landed, with the girl,—the N. Y. Com. Adv. of Wed-
nesday, says “it has been ascertained—so we are in-
formed—that the young woman was not Miss Rogers,
and that no injury was done to her.”
   The Com. Adv. says further—“There is no evi-
dence that we know of, that she went to Hoboken at
all on that fatal Sunday, and many are of opinion that
the murder was committed either in this city or upon
the river, in a boat. Yet, on the other hand, we know
that information, has been given to the police of a
<d>[Col.2]</d>
discovery upon the Jersey shore which perhaps may
indicate the spot where the atrocious deed was perpe-
trated.”
   As far as we have heard (says the N. Y. Sun) the
mystery is just as far from being in a train for dissipa-
tion, as it ever was—notwithstanding the thousand ru-
mors that have found their way to the public.

   T<small>HE</small> M<small>URDER OF</small> M<small>ISS</small> R<small>OGERS</small>.—The Moth-
er, aunt, and an acquaintance of the deceased,
yesterday attended at the Police Office and in-
spected parts of the dress, taken from the body,
and each of those three ladies identified it as
part of the dress worn by Miss Rogers, on the
day she left home. Her identity is therefore
now placed beyond all doubt. The two young
men who found the body were also examined,
<d>[Col.2]</d>
but nothing was elicited from their testimony,
which has not been published already, except
that when they found the deceased, there was no
rope or tying of any kind, on the neck or any
other part of the body. Two witnesses were al-
so examined, but their testimony cast no further
light upon the matter.
   It is satisfactorily ascertained that the young
woman seen at Hoboken by Messrs. Fanshaw and
Thomas on the day of the disappearance of Miss
Rogers, was not Miss Rogers. Her affidavit, as
stated by the Courier and Enquirer, is to the fol-
lowing effect:
   On the 25th of July, (Sunday,) while in a boat
on the Hudson with one young man, another boat
came alongside, in which were seven young men
averaging about <i>seventeen years of age</i>, who beat
and maltreated her companion, and forcibly took
her from the boat, landed her at Hoboken and
then took her into the woods, where she was
treated with the most brutal violence by the par-
ty. She was then put back into the boat, and
landed in this city at a late hour. Every one of
these hopeful gallows birds had on their <i>braces,
backs, or bosoms</i>, the figures 27. Of course they
could not be members of the Fire Department,
and the question is, who are they? The girl does
not know the name of one of them.

   M<small>ARY</small> C. R<small>OGERS</small>.—The remarks in our paper
of yesterday, relative to the extraordinary conduct
of Mr. Daniel Payne, have attracted considerable
attention. The best construction that can be put
upon it by no means creditable to him. The indif-
ference and apathy which, according to his own
account he manifested after being informed of the
discovery of the body of his affianced wife, stamp
him as a cold blooded and heartless individual. Sym-
pathy for the unfortunate victim, and the desire for
retributive justice on her murderers would seem to
be the necessary result of a knowledge of the facts,
even in the breasts of strangers, and it therefore
seems almost incredible that one professing to be
bound to the poor girl by the strongest ties of affec-
tion should suffer her body to be buried without
even desiring to look for the last time upon her
face. The circumstances seems so incompatible
with the impulse of a rightly constituted mind, that
it is difficult to avoid attributing it to something
more than mere indifference.
   An examination took place yesterday at the police
office, of W. H. <u>Kurkuck</u>, seaman on board the U. S.
Ship North Carolina, Henry Mallin, No.333 Broad-
way, and James <u>Boullard</u>, 321 Broadway, (who first
discovered the body) Alfred Crommelin, Doctor
Cook, Mrs. Rogers, and A. W. <u title="Padley (elsewhere)">Padly</u>, who corrobo-
rated the statements of Crommelin as far as he was
concerned and in company with him. Nothing
was elicited furnishing any new clue to the actors
in this heinous affair. It would seem that the poor
girl was robbed as well as violated and murdered. She
had jewelry on her person when she left her moth-
er's house, but none when she was found. Possibly
the trinkets may have been pledged or sold. Strict
inquiry should be made at the pawnbrokers' shops,
&c. A portion of the dress taken from the corpse
by Mr. Alfred Crommelin was recognized by the
mother, and there is now no longer the slightest
doubt as to the identity of the body.—<i>Times and

			POLICE REFORM.
   We believe there is not and hardly can be a difference of
opinion among our citizens on this point, that the Police Sys-
tem of New-York is deplorably defective and needs immedi-
ate, energetic Reform. We cast no censure here upon indi-
viduals; we insist only on the palpable truth that the exist-
ing system is vicious and must be reformed. A shocking
murder has recently been committed in our City or vicinity,
probably in daylight, and at the end of the third week the
murderers remain wholly unsuspected! Four days after the
murder had been committed, two days after the body had
been found, our authorities and officers did not even know
that a murder had been committed!—Now they are hard at
work on a cold scent to trace out the offenders and bring
them to justice, but <i>they can only discharge their public du-
ties at the sacrifice of their private interests</i>. Some of our
best officers have been on the alert night and day for two
weeks, with a certainty that they receive not one farthing,
unless from private liberality, for their arduous and not im-
probably dangerous services. Is this right? Can we blame
the officer who, on learning that a great crime against human
life has been committed and another against individual pro-
perty, starts on the track of the latter where a reward is
offered, and leaves the former where there is none? Do we
not drive him to this course? How else can he support his
family? And is not the system—to make short work of it
—calculated to give impunity to <u>violaters</u> and murderers?
   —We throw out these suggestions as introductory to the
following Plan for the Organization of a more efficient Police
by a well known and respected citizen, whose experience in
such matters entitle him to command attention. He pro-
poses—

safety; but for the arrest of murderers, highway robbers,
burglars, actual counterfeiters, singly or in gangs, I would
have them liberally paid out of the public treasury; and to
reimburse the treasury, I would assess all stolen or robbed
property which should be discovered and secured by the offi-
cers. This would, I believe, secure a fidelity and vigilance
in their department that would prove a terror to evil-doers
and a shield to the public.

		<m8>Reported for the Courier & Enquirer.</m8>
		POLICE—Saturday and Sunday.
   <i>The case of Mary C. Rogers</i>.—We are pleased to
be able to state, that at length a clue has beyond all
doubt or cavil been discovered, which will lead to
the detection of the perpetrators of this dreadful out-
rage. All the affidavits and examinations heretofore
taken, have no bearing whatever on the case, and
even the mother of the unfortunate deceased has
confessed, that the recent discovery is the only one
that can shed light upon the fate of her daughter.
   The Reporter is not at liberty to state all that has
been told to him on the subject, but he is authorised
to say, that officers are now in pursuit of a man, who
was seen at Hoboken with Miss R. on the afternoon
of the 25th of July, (the day she was murdered,) and
that he was heard quarrelling with her. The investi-
gation has been followed up with the most scrupulous
minuteness, so as to leave scarce a shade of doubt as
to his guilt, by the gentleman to whom the commu-
nity owes the arrest of the most notorious scoundrel
that ever escaped the gallows, and he is entirely con-
vinced that the person now sought for is the guilty
party. He has the best wishes of the whole commu-
nity for his success in this outrageous affair.

   As if two outrages of this kind were not enough for
one life time, we have already to record two others,
and although unlike the case of Mary C. Rogers,
death did not terminate the outrage, perhaps even that<!-- Poorly visible parts are from Albany-Evening-Journal-1841-08-17 -->
would have been preferable to the treatment the un-
fortunate victims received.
   On Thursday evening last, a gentleman accompa-
nied by his wife and daughter, the latter aged about
18 years, engaged a small boat, in which were four
men, in the upper part of the city, to take them to a
spot near Williamsburg—on landing the party left
the boat, but after they had proceeded a short dis-
tance, the daughter discovering she had left her para-
sol in the boat, went back to get it, her parents
continuing on their walk. When she reached the
boat she saw the parasol in the stern-sheets, where
she had been sitting, and stepped in to get it, when
the ruffians in charge of the boat, pushed from the
shore and pulled into the middle of the stream, where
they accomplished their hellish designs—they then
rowed to the New York side, and left the poor girl
on the dock here, more dead than alive. We believe
that this case has not been made known to the autho-
rities here, but surely if it were it could not be diffi-
<d>[Col.2]</d>
cult to detect these scoundrels. We hope that no
motives of delicacy will prevent the making of the
complaint. [The above case we have from a gentle-
man in Brooklyn.]
   The other case is that of a young lady, who was
walking with some female friends in the woods, near
the shot tower on this Island. She got separated
from them in some measure, and was met by four
ruffians who took her into a more secluded spot, and
there brutally treated her. Only one of the villains
is known, but his arrest is certain, and we sincerely
trust that if ever brought to trial such punishment
may be meted out to him as will forever check the
perpetration of these outrages, so shocking to every
feeling of our nature.

   The Murder of Miss Rogers, of your city, is a truly

would attach a little more importance to the legiti-

the procurement of indictments against certain news-
papers, public justice and the cause of humanity
would be more properly subserved. You may de-
pend on it that Governor Seward will offer a re-
ward, and then the murder will out, not before.
Your officers will do nothing effectual till they see
they are to make money by it. The absence of the

		<b>The Mary Rogers Mystery.</b>
   This dreadful deed seems to be shrouded in as
much mystery, as on the day we first called public
attention to the details of a crime which, if left un-
discovered, must fix an indelible stain on the charac-
ter of this city.
   His Honor the Mayor has taken the matter in
hand, and from his untiring energy, united with the
labors of the Committee of citizens, we yet hope,
that the miscreants may be brought to justice. His
Honor has already dissipated the absurd notion,
which we alluded to on Saturday, of the girl having
committed suicide. The testimony of Dr. Cook on
the inquest, who has been re-examined, completely
settles that point. From the careful <i>post mortem</i>
examination which the Doctor made, he is confi-
dent that Mary Rogers was brutally violated by six,
or possibly, eight ruffians; of that fact, he had ocu-
lar proof, but which is unfit for publication. He
also testifies to another important fact, viz: that there
were marks of the pressure of fingers and thumbs
about the throat and in the region of the jugular
vein, which renders it highly probable that this poor
girl died while in the brutal and beastly embraces
of one of her murderers. There were also marks
as of a severe pressure from some hard substance
across the loins and shoulders, which renders it pro-
bable that her horrible violation was effected in
some stable or out-house, from whence the body
was then carried to the North River and thrown in
for the purpose of hiding this double crime forever
from the eye of the world.
   Now these are facts clearly ascertained, and what
is the conclusion we must draw therefrom? why,
that the girl was taken by a gang of soaplocks or
gamblers, who may perhaps have had the deed in
contemplation for weeks or months, and who have
ere now fled the city. From her connection with
Anderson's cigar store and the proximity of that es-
tablishment to that resort of gamblers, blacklegs,
soaplocks and loafers, known as “Head Quarters,” it
is highly probable that the crime was perpetrated by
some of that lawless fraternity, who make this city
their home in the spring and fall, and who migrate
from city to city to spread the poison of their arts
among the young men and to ensnare the virtue of
all the women who may fall in their way.
   Every city in the Union should, therefore, be
searched and the magistracy and police of every
town and village be put on the alert for the purpose
of bringing these offenders to justice.
   Again, it is known that these bands of gamblers,
are wealthy, and that they are the pricipal support-
ers of the assignation houses of this and other cities,
and of certain other public houses where high play
is winked at, ought not all the keepers of such pla-
ces to be examined, in order to ascertain, if possible
what gamblers were in the city on the day this
crime was committed, and to ferret out the where-
abouts of those who left about that time, as also of
those who have since been missing from their usual
haunts of vies and dissipation. If measures of this
kind are adopted—and that too speedily—the strong
arm of justice may yet have these blood thirsty vil-
lains within her grasp, and innocent blood no long-
er cry from the ground for vengeance.
   Other inquiries must also be set on foot—a free
pardon might be offered to any one who would con-
fess—and if necessary, the Police must scatter them-
selves all round this city and its environs, until they
do discover some trace or get hold of some clue,
which may lead to the satisfying of the public mind.
There is a growing feeling of the inefficiency of our
Police abroad—and public opinion, will raise a fear-
ful outcry against them if these murderers remain
undiscovered; and it will be too a deep stain on our
moral escutcheon, and one which will remain as an
eternal blot on our social, moral and political sys-
tem, which no time can efface. Foreigners will
point the finger of scorn at us, and we shall be cited
as a community where ravishers and murderers are
allowed to commit deeds of blood with impunity.
   The following from our reporter contains the latest
particulars of this tragedy:—
   Notwithstanding the many and confident rumors
that a man was in custody at the Upper Police, on
whom a strong suspicion of guilt rests, we can safe-
ly assure our readers that up to a late hour last night
no arrest has been effected. Justice Taylor has ta-
ken testimony which tends to fix the guilt of having
been seen with a female at Hoboken on the fatal
Sunday, answering the description of Mary Rogers,
on a particular individual who can be identified.—
That person has left the city. An officer with the
witness who is to identify him has been despatched,
with orders to spare neither time, trouble, nor ex-
pense, in order to effect his arrest. The Justice says
that this testimony taken before him, goes to fix
positively his interview with Mary Rogers at Hobo-
ken so late as 6 o'clock at night on the Sunday, and
that this witness has identified the bonnet the girl
wore, and described her parasol and dress with the
most surprising accuracy. If this fellow is above
ground he must be forthcoming.
   At the Lower Police a note was received through
the post, written in a disguised hand, which ran
thus—
<m9>						A<small>UGUST 14</small>.
M<small>ESSRS</small>,—
   E. Keyser, 43 <u title="Washington">Wasnington</u> street, knows some-
thing of the murder of M. C. Rogers. Anonymous let-
ters speak truth sometimes. You would do well to ex-
amine him.</m9>
   A summons was immediately issued by Justice
Merritt, for Mr. Keyser's attendance, and he will be
had up to-day, but this, like the former letters we
alluded to last week, will most likely lead to no-
thing.
   Dr. Cook is also to be re-examined by the Mayor,
and his testimony, touching the state of the body, is of
very great importance now.

   <i>The Mysterious Death of Miss Rogers</i>.—The
Police of our city are still actively engaged in fer-
reting out the circumstances attending the suppos-
ed murder of the above named unfortunate girl.
A number of witnesses have been examined since
Thursday, but no clue as yet has been discovered
that will tend to implicate any known person or
persons. There are many circumstances attend-
ing this transaction that would tend strongly to
convey the belief that this girl committed suicide.
Officer Cockefair informed us yesterday, that he
had learned from the colored servant woman lately
in the employ of Mrs. Rogers, that on the Sunday
that Mary left home, her mother stated that she and
Mary had had a serious conversation relative to her
intended marriage with Payne, and that she had in
the end obtained Mary's positive promise that she
would not marry him. And also, that on the af-
ternoon of the same day Mrs. Rogers expressed
much astonishment that Mary had not returned,
and stated that she feared she would never see her
again! It is also said that when the body was
found there was not the slightest article of jewelry
on her person. This would also lead to the suppo-
sition that she had determined upon suicide before
leaving the house, and consequently had purposely
avoided taking any with her. And further, so far
as we have seen any evidence that was presented
at the time she was found, or at the partial post
mortem examination, nothing had been elicited
that would show proof positive that she was mur-
dered. We also understand that at the time she<a id="Evening-Post-1841-08-16-Marys-parasol"></a>
left home she took with her a silk parasol with
scroll handle, and a shawl trimmed with black
fringe. If either of these articles has been found,
the person having them in possession would aid in
the investigation now going on at the Police, by
stating the circumstances under which they be-
came possessed of them.—<i>New Era</i>.
			——
   A<small>NOTHER</small> O<small>UTRAGE</small>.—We heard this morning
of an occurrence, which happened a day or two a-
go, which we hope for the credit of human nature
is untrue. Four men were employed to carry a
family party, consisting of a gentleman, his wife
and daughter, from New York to Williamsburgh.
They were landed safely on this side, and the party
proceeded on their way; they had not gone far,
when the young lady discovered that she had left
her parasol on board the boat. She returned to get
it—the boat was close to the shore—she stepped in-
to it, and was immediately followed by the men be-
longing to the boat. They shoved off into the riv-
er, and with a fiendishness characteristic of hell it-
self, committed a deed too shocking to mention.
The poor girl was then put on shore on the New
York side, and the inhuman brutes left her to her
misery and despair. We hear this story from re-
spectable authority; but we cannot but believe
there is some mistake.—We sincerely hope so, al-
though from recent experience, there seems to be
monsters enough in New York capable of commit-
ting any deed of blood and horror.—<i>Brooklyn

   R<small>OWDIES</small> A<small>GAIN</small>.—We are informed that, yesterday
afternoon, as a young gentleman and lady were re-
turning from a walk in the upper part of the city,
when in the 10th Avenue, above Jane street, they
were set upon by a gang of rowdies who hang around
the Greenwich and Spring street markets, and the
lady taken with violence from her companion, who
was beaten in a most cowardly manner.
   A crowd having collected, some of the bystanders
interfered and rescued both the lady and gentleman
from the hands of the brutal scoundrels; none of
whom, as far as we can learn, were apprehended. It
is time, indeed, when such occurrences take place in
broad daylight, and are suffered to pass unnoticed by our
city authorities, that public attention should be roused
and some steps taken to remedy the present ineffi-
cient state of our Police. The recent awful murder
of <i>Mary Rogers</i> is still fresh upon our minds, and
yet here is another case, which, but for a timely
rescue, might have resulted in some similar outrage.
   Something must be done, and that, too, quickly.

   ☞ The horrible outrages upon females so thickly report-
ed in our City for a few days past cannot be traced to any re-
liable source. That alleged to have taken place upon a
young woman between this city and Williamsburg, seems
especially without foundation.

<d>[Col.3]</d>
   T<small>HE</small> M<small>URDER OF</small> M<small>ISS</small> R<small>OGERS</small>.—The Mayor and Magis-
trates of both the Upper and Lower Police Offices are yet
actively and earnestly engaged in endeavors to detect and ar-
rest the murderer or murderers of Miss Mary C. Rogers, for
murdered she assuredly was, and the idle stories that she
was the author of her own destruction cannot, for a moment,
be entertained. There is nothing as yet <i>positive</i> as to the
person who did the dreadful deed, as some of the public
journals have so vauntingly announced. It is true that sus-
picion has fallen with, perhaps, much propriety on an indi-
vidual who has been considered respectable in business and
connections; who was seen in company with the young lady
a little before six o'clock on Sunday evening, the 25th July,
in earnest conversation, but <i>not quarrelling</i> with her as has
been stated, and which individual left the City under suspi-
cious circumstances the day after the body was discovered,
and has not since returned. This person and a young fe-
male answering the description of Miss Rogers were seen
conversing as stated by two gentlemen who were strangers
to both the parties, and who can only describe their appear-
ance and dress, which correspond with those of the suspect-
ed person and the young lady. <i>No warrants</i>, however, have
been issued, but the authorities have sent an officer to a dis-
tance in pursuit of the suspected person, accompanied by
one of the gentlemen who saw them conversing, in order to
identify him when found.
   There are also collateral circumstances attendant on the
flight of the suspected individual, that combined, tend great-
ly to strengthen the suspicion of his guilt. Still there is
nothing <i>positive</i>, as the person accused when arrested may
be able to account for his absence, and may be innocent, as
persons other than himself may have subsequently to his
leaving her, seen, conversed with and violated the girl and
then destroyed her. Still the Police acted promptly in the
matter, and the result of their efforts will be known in two
or three days, of which our readers will be duly advised.
   The Police authorities are pursuing their investigations in
secret in order to prevent the guilty from becoming acquaint-
ed with the facts they elicit, and thus defeat the purposes of
the inquiry, which seems to be the object of some to do by
premature exposures, while they at the same time denounce
the authorities for the very inefficiency they assist in creating.
There is little doubt, we think, however, that an important
arrest will soon be made, that will in some measure relieve
the pressure of public anxiety on this exciting subject. Dr.
Cook of New-Jersey, and the Coroner of Hudson County,
who held the inquest, were examined yesterday before the
Mayor and confirmed the fact of her violation and murder, as
has been before stated.

   D<small>EATHS IN</small> N<small>EW</small>-Y<small>ORK</small>.—The City Inspector reports the
deaths of 30 Men, 29 Women, 67 Boys and 76 Girls—in all

<d>[Col.5. As in <a href="#Evening-Post-1841-08-16">Evening Post</a>]</d>
   A<small>NOTHER</small> O<small>UTRAGE</small>.—We heard this morning of
an occurrence, which happened a day or two ago,
which we hope, for the credit of human nature, is
untrue. Four men were employed to carry a family
party, consisting of a gentleman, his wife and daugh-
ter, from New York to Williamsburg. They were
landed safely on this side, and the party proceed-
ed on their way; they had not gone far, when
the young lady discovered that she had left her para-
sol on board the boat. She returned to get it—the
boat was close to the shore—she stepped into it, and
was immediately followed by the men belonging to
the boat. They shoved off into the river, and with
a fiendishness characteristic of hell itself, committed
a deed too shocking to mention. The poor girl was
then put on shore on the New York side, and the
inhuman brutes left her to her misery and despair.
We hear this story from respectable authority; but
we cannot but believe there is some mistake. We
sincerely hope so, although from recent experience,
there seems to be monsters enough in New York
capable of committing any deed of blood and hor-
ror.—<i>Brooklyn News</i>.

by Justice Taylor has not yet returned, nor is he expect-
ed for a day or two, so we have nothing to report from
the upper police, in relation to the mysterious murder of
Mary Rogers. We believe that the Mr. Keyser, alluded
to in the anonymous note received by Justice Merritt,
has not been got hold of, so that the public mind will be
kept in suspense for some time longer. The city was
full of rumors yesterday, of other outrages, but we be-
lieve most of them were of the kind known as made out
of whole cloth. At all events there have been no fresh
complaints.

		   <b>The Mystery of Blood.</b>
   S<small>IR</small>:—It strikes me that the evidence is given in
newspapers, relative to the unfortunate Mary Ro-
gers, is extremely loose and disconnected—for in-
stance, Payne, to whom the poor girl was en-
gaged to be married, says that she knocked at
his bed room on the fatal Sunday, and said she
was going to Mrs. <u>Downings</u>—but no evidence is
given that she did actually leave her mother's house,
or that she did go to Mrs. Downing's—if she did not
go to Mrs. Downing's she must have called else-
where, and may there have been detained and mur-
dered—if she did go to Mrs. Downing's, then at
what hour did she leave to return home. These
points may already have been cleared up but it does
not so appear by any evidence yet published. Again
—a letter is published by some person, signed “T. D.
W.” stating that on the Sunday, (no hour is men-
tioned) whilst at Hoboken he saw a boat come
rapidly across from towards New-York, and a girl
and several men land from it—which boat was fol-
lowed by a second boat, from which three men lan-
ded and made enquiries respecting the party who
had landed from the first boat. The writer of that
letter mentions two young men who were standing
near to him at the time, and the Journal of Com-
merce gives the names of those young men—so far
so good—but it does not appear to have been ascer-
tained whether those young men had or had not
any acquaintance with Mary Rogers, either during
the period of her service in the cigar shop or since
—nor does it appear whether they noticed or knew
the writer of that letter, as he noticed them. Far
be it from me to cast any suspicion upon any one—
I merely notice these things now, as some proof (in
my opinion at least) of the looseness with which the
enquiries regarding this horrid murder have been
conducted—evidence to be made valuable in the
early stage of an enquiry of this sort, should be very
closely pursued. I don't see it stated either at what
hour she left her mother's, or the hour she got to
Mrs. Downing's if she did get there. Payne's evi-
dence is very inconclusive and unsatisfactory on
many points—he fancied the omnibuses run on Sun-
days, and because it rained he would not go and
meet her to whom he was engaged to be married—
and when her body was found, never went to see
it! Will you, if you think it worth while, point out
these things, for really there is a horrible mystery

<b>The Murder of Mary Rogers—Examination
   of Dr. Cook before his Honor the Mayor,
   and the Coroner, Dr. Archer.</b>
   His Honor the Mayor is now using the utmost pos-
sible exertions to detect and bring to justice the
murderers of Mary C. Rogers. Yesterday he ex-
amined Dr. Cook, of Hoboken, in the Mayor's
office, and our talented Coroner, Dr. Archer, was
also present.
   We took full notes of the whole of the testimony;
but, under the directions of his Honor, we, of course,
suppress all that portion of it, the publication of
which would be calculated to defeat the ends of pub-
lic justice. Nevertheless, there is so much in his
testimony, calculated to clear up all doubts about the
manner of this poor girl's death, and the brutal vio-
lence she endured previous to being murdered, and
the testimony of Dr. Cook is so clear and positive
upon these points, that we fell a publication of those
portions of his evidence is due to an enquiring and
anxious public, who desire to be fully informed on
all those matters. Still, there are many details,
(medical and scientific,) in this portion of his evi-
dence, of so delicate a nature that they cannot be al-
lowed to meet the public eye through the columns
of a newspaper. These, therefore, we also sup-
press. From what we give below, however, the
public will perceive that their sympathies have not
been ill bestowed.<a id="Herald-1841-08-17-2-Dr-Cook"></a>
		E<small>XAMINATION OF</small> D<small>R</small>. C<small>OOK</small>.
   <i>Mayor</i>—Dr. Cook, you examined the body of Ma-
ry Rogers after death?
   <i>Dr. Cook</i>—I did.
   <i>Mayor</i>—Did you find marks of violence upon her
person, sufficient to cause death?
   <i>Dr. C.</i>—I certainly should say there were.
   <i>Mayor</i>—Were they produced by the brutal viola-
tion of her person or otherwise?
   <i>Dr. C.</i>—I think that she fainted; and that before
she recovered, her murderers tied a piece of fine
lace trimming, tight round her neck, which prevented
her breathing again.
   <i>Mayor</i>—Did you ascertain that she had not been
killed by being smothered?
   <i>Dr. C.</i>—I did for all practical purposes.
   <i>Mayor</i>—Did you ascertain whether she had been
drugged or not?
   <i>Dr. C.</i>—At the time she was found and under the
circumstances, it would have been impossible to
have distinctly ascertained that point. The ablest
writers have discussed and settled that subject.
   <i>Mayor</i>—Was her chemise torn and bound round
her waist, as had been stated by some?
   <i>Dr. C.</i>—Not her chemise, sir, but other parts of
her dress, which I will afterwards describe.
   <i>Mayor</i>—Go on, sir, and describe the state in which
you found the body.
   <i>Dr. C.</i>—It was found about 300 yards from the
shore, as has been stated, a rope was placed round
it by those who found it, and towed to the shore.—
The face when I examined it was suffused with
blood—bruised blood. There was frothy blood still
issuing from the mouth, but no foam, which issues
from the mouth of persons who die by drowning.
   <i>Mayor</i>—Are you firmly of opinion that her death
was not occasioned by drowning.
   <i>Dr. C.</i>—Most decidedly. Her face was swollen,
the veins were highly distended. If she had been
drowned there would not have been those particular
appearances that I found in the veins. The blood
was so much coagulated that it was with difficulty I
could get it to follow the lancet at all. If she had
been drowned the discoloration would have been in
the cellular tissue and not in the veins. There was
an <u title="ecchymose (bruise)">echymose</u> mark about the size and shape of a
man's thumb on the right side of the neck, near the
jugular vein, and two or three <u>echymose</u> marks on
the left side resembling in shape a man's fingers,
which led me to believe she had been throttled and
partially choked by a man's hand. Both arms were
bent over on the chest; and were so tight and stiff
that we had to use some force to straighten them.—
The right hand was clenched, and the left hand was
partially open, but rigid.
   <i>Mayor</i>—What in your opinion was that position
of the hands occasioned by?
   <i>Dr. C.</i>—It might have been, and did appear as if
the wrists had been tied together, and as if she had
raised her hands to try to tear something from off
her mouth and neck, which was choking and
strangling her. The fact of her arms being in that
bent position, also further convinces me that she
was not drowned. For I have attended 16 or 17
cases of deaths by drowning, and invariable found
that the arms were extended.
   <i>Mayor</i>—What other marks did you see?
   <i>Dr. C.</i>—There was excoriation of the left wrist
in the form of two circles around it, as if a rope had
been tied around it once or twice; the right wrist
was also excoriated, but only on the upper side; this
further confirmed me in the belief that the wrists
had been tied together, therefore the under part of
the right wrist was not excoriated. There was also
a slight excoriation of the middle metacarpal bone
on the right wrist. All this excoriation was no doubt
done by a cord.
   <i>Mayor</i>—Might it not have been done by a man's
hands grasping her wrists and she struggling to get
her hands free?
   Dr. Cook then took hold of the Mayor's wrist, and
explained to him that this could not be possible, be-
cause, in any such a case, the excoriation would
only be partial, and in spots, and could not be in a
complete circle. The hands had been tied, proba-
bly, while the body was violated, and untied before
she was thrown into the water.
   <i>Mayor</i>—Were there any marks upon the back?
   <i>Dr. C.</i>—There was considerable excoriation upon
the top of the back and both shoulder bones, and
excoriation also at the bottom of the back.
   <i>Mayor</i>—How, in your opinion, was this produ-
ced?
   <i>Dr. C.</i>—I think, by the young girl struggling to
get free, while being brutally held down on her back,
to effect her violation; and, therefore, that this out-
rage was effected while she was laid down upon
some hard substance, a hard board floor, the bottom
of a <u>board</u>, or something similar. It convinces me
fully that the outrage was not effected on a bed.
   <i>Mayor</i>—Might or might not those marks and ex-
coriations have been caused by the body coming in
contact with some hard substance after death, either
in the river or elsewhere?
   <i>Dr. C.</i>—They could not. Because the coagula-
tion was in these cases in the cellular tissues.
   <i>Mayor</i>—In what state was the dress?
   <i>Dr. C.</i>—The dress was much torn in several
places. The outer dress was torn in this way: a
long slip, say a foot wide, was torn up from the bot-
tom of the frock to the waist, <i>but the piece was not
torn off</i>; it was wound three times round the waist;
and secured by a sort of hitch in the back; The
dress immediately beneath the frock, and between
the frock and upper petticoat, was made of fine mus-
lin; a piece was torn clean out of this garment, about
a foot or 18 inches in width; this piece was torn very
evenly, and with great care, commencing at the bot-
tom of the garment. This same piece was afterwards
tied round her mouth, with a hard knot at the back
part of the neck; I think this was done to smother
her cries, and that it was probably held tight round
her mouth by one of her brutal ravishers. This
same piece of muslin was found by me around
her neck, fitting loosely to the neck with the
knot remaining. Over these were tied the hat
and hat strings, the strings were tied over this
piece of muslin <i>in a slip knot; not a lady's knot</i>. In
a sailor's knot. I consider that her hat was off her
head at the time of the outrage, and that after her
violation and murder had been completed, it was
tied on.
   <i>Mayor</i>—What else did you find tied round her
neck?
   <i>Dr. C.</i>—The piece of fine lace trimming I before
spoke of. This for some time escaped my attention.
I observed a crease round the neck, but as the flesh
appeared swollen, I thought it might be a natural
crease in the neck; but passing my hand behind her
ear, I accidentally felt a small knot; and found that
a piece of lace, which I supposed to have been the
trimming of her lace collar, <i>was tied so tightly round
her neck as to have been hidden from sight</i> in the flesh
of the neck; <i>this was tied in a hard knot under the
left ear</i>. This would have strangled her.
   <i>Mayor</i>—Were there any cuts on the face or head,
or any marks thereon as though done with any blunt
or sharp instrument?
   <i>Dr. C.</i>—None whatever.
   <i>Mayor</i>—Was the body in such a state when you
first saw it that there could be no difficulty about the
recognizing of it.
   <i>Dr. C.</i>—It was; and Mr. Crommelin appeared to
recognise it immediately.
   The rest of Dr. Cook's examination is of such a
nature that it cannot be given in detail. It related,
however, to the appearances of the body, which en-
abled the doctor to state positively that the poor
girl had been brutally violated. The following,
however, in the substance of what he did say on this
subject. He said that previous to this shocking out-
rage, she had evidently been a person of chastity
and correct habits; that her person was horribly vio-
lated <i>by more than two or three persons</i>; he gave suf-
ficient reasons for coming to this conclusion. He
also stated distinctly, that he examined fully on that
point, and found that there was not the slightest
trace of pregnancy.
   Such is as full an account as can be given to-day
of this shocking scene. Under the circumstances
would it not be advisable to offer a free pardon to
any one of the accomplices who will confess.

   T<small>HE</small> C<small>ASE OF</small> M<small>ARY</small> C. R<small>OGERS</small>.—Wednes-
day afternoon, Mr. Daniel C. Payne, of 47
John-street, the young man to whom the un-
fortunate Miss Rogers was engaged in mar-
riage, went to the Police Office, at the request
of Justice Parker, to state what information
he might possess calculated to throw light
upon the mysterious disappearance and mur-
der of Miss R. The examination, which was
long and tedious elicited nothing which is
likely to lead to the detection of the murder-
ers. He states that on Sunday morning about
10 o'clock, she called at his room and stated
that she was going to her cousin's, Mrs. Down-
ing's, and should return in the evening. She
then left, apparently cheerful and lively as
usual. He did not go to see her in the evening,
as it rained, and the next morning her fami-
ly was alarmed, and he went in search of
her, but found no tidings or trace of her till
her lifeless remains were discovered in the
Hudson on the Wednesday following.
   By order of the Acting Mayor, Purdy, her
body was yesterday disinterred, in order that
the deceased might be more fully identified
by some of the witnesses; but decomposition
had already taken place, and no trace of the
once 'beautiful cigar girl' could be recognized
in the blackened and swollen features.
   There is one point in Mr. Payne's testimo-
ny which is worthy of remark. It seems he
had been searching for Miss Rogers—his be-
trothed—two or three days; yet when he was
informed on Wednesday evening that her
body had been found at Hoboken, he did not
go to see it or inquire into the matter—in fact,
it appears that he never went at all, though
he had been there inquiring for her before.—
This is odd and, should have been explained.<a id="Farmer-1841-08-17-Marys-disappearance"></a>
   The public prints seem to concur in the fact
that this unfortunate girl was amiable and vir-
tuous. She had not latterly been engaged in
Mr. Anderson's cigar store; during the period
she was in his employ, she won the good opi-
nion of him and his family, by the strict pro-
priety of her conduct. A report will be recol-
lected of her having disappeared for a time.
This it is said was the sheer invention of
a Newspaper Reporter, and, at the time,
caused the poor girl a fit of sickness. She had
for some time been boarding with her mother
who keeps a boarding-house at 126 Nassau-st.
and was 20 years of age.
<m8>   No reward for the discovery of the murderers has yet
been offered by the Governor and Mayor. A reward
of $500 has been offered by the committee appointed on
Wednesday evening, with an intimation that it will be
increased to $1000.
   The police magistrates were engaged during the past
week in the examination of a number of witnesses, but
their testimony has thrown no light upon the matter.</m8>

   The two gentlemen alluded to in the above, are
William D. Fanshaw, (nephew of Daniel Fanshaw,
printer to the American Bible and Tract Societies)
and his brother-in-law, Mr Thomas. We have called
on Mr. Fanshaw, to ascertain the correctness of the
statements in the latter, and he informs us that they
are correct in every particular. From the clue thus
furnished, it is to be hoped that the perpetrators of the
diabolical outrage and murder will yet be found out.
Where so many are in the secret, some one or more of
them are very liable to reveal it. Let the Police be on
the alert.—<i>N. Y. Jour. of Com</i>.

BOKEN</small>.—It is now well ascertained that unfor-
tunate young girl, named Mary Rogers, (who three
years ago, lived with Anderson, the cigar man) has
been cruelly murdered at Hoboken. Nothing of so
horrible and brutal a nature has occurred since <u>the
the</u> murder of Miss Sands, which formed the basis
of the story of Norman Leslie. The Mother of Ma-
ry kept a respectable boarding house, for the last
two years, at 126 Nassau st. Here Mary lived ever
since the house was opened, and was the main stay
of her mother. She did all the marketing, and con-
ducted herself with the utmost propriety. She has
not been at Anderson's for nearly two years. On
Sunday night, she left her mother's <u title="'purposing' in Herald">proposing</u>
to go to church with the children of her aunt, who lives
in Greenwich street. As all the family were out
of town, the aunt does not know whether she called
there or not. The next time she was heard of was
on Wednesday last, when she was found dead,—
murdered,—near the Sybil's cave, at Hoboken. It
now remains for the mayor of New York and Jer-
sey cities to do their duties.—<i>N. Y. Herald</i>.
   The Police have no trace, as yet, of the murder-
er of the ill-fated Miss Rogers at Hoboken.

the steamboat Worcester, which arrived from Nor-
wich, Ct., this morning, brought the man who is
suspected of having murdered Miss Rogers. His
name is Morse, and he was brought on in irons. He
was arrested yesterday at the Boston Post Office,
just as he was opening a letter from this city. The
letter is reported to have been from <u>Kiekuck</u>, the
sailor on board of the North Carolina, who was
examined lately before the police. It recommend-
ed Morse to change his dress, since the police were
in pursuit of him, and stated at the same time that
the writer, should he be examined again, would be
obliged to make a full disclosure. It is supposed
from this that the letter referred to the case of Miss
Rogers.

   T<small>HE</small> C<small>ASE OF</small> M. C. R<small>OGERS</small>.—The Mayor and
Police are on the alert in ferreting out the supposed
murderer or murderers of this ill-fated young woman.
   A person from this city was yesterday arrested at
Worcester, Mass., and was brought here this morn-
ing by officers from the Upper Police, on suspicion
of being implicated in the murder. The ostensible
cause of arrest was that he had abandoned his wife.
A person answering the description of this one was
last seen in the company of Mary Rogers, on the Ho-
boken shore, about 6 o'clock on Sunday evening—
and the individual arrested left this city abruptly
soon after the discovery of the murdered body.
   When taken at Worcester, he was in the act of re-
ceiving a letter from New York, advising him to shave
off his whiskers, and change his clothes, as the police
were in pursuit of him.
   No name is given, and therefore we abstain from
repeating that in general circulation, or from any of the
allusions to the outrage on the deceased, which, with
such revolting pruriency, even decent journals repeat.

   A<small>RREST OF THE</small> S<small>USPECTED</small> M<small>URDERER OF</small> M<small>ISS</small> R<small>O-
GERS</small>.—Yesterday morning Officer <u title="Hilliker (elsewhere)">Hillicker</u> of the Upper
Police Office arrived in this city in the steamer from Nor-
wich, having in custody a man named Joseph W. Morse,
wood-engraver, late of No. 120 Nassau st. suspected of be-
ing concerned in the murder of Miss Mary C. Rogers at Ho-
boken on Sunday evening, the 25th July. He was arrested
at West Boylston, seven miles from Worcester, Massachu-
setts, on Sunday by the officer—having been loitering about
there for several days under an assumed name. Prior to his
arrest a letter was found in the Post Office at Worcester, di-
rected to him, and written, doubtless, by one of his compan-
ions in this city, informing him of the examinations that were
progressing here, advising him to shave off his whiskers,
change his dress and alter his appearance, so as to escape
detection and arrest. This was opened and read, and tend-
ed to strengthen the suspicions against him. As soon as ar-
rested he inquired what he was arrested for, and on being
told for assault and battery on his wife, he replied, “Oh! is
that all.” On being asked where he was on Sunday, the
25th July, he first said he was at Hoboken, and on the officer
echoing the answer, he then said he meant that he was at
Staten Island. He was conveyed to the Upper Police Office
and committed. Soon after he was brought out in the pres-
ence of the Mayor and Justice Taylor, and identified by two
gentlemen as the person they saw at Hoboken at 6 o'clock
on Sunday, the 25th ult. seated on a bench and conversing
with Miss Rogers. He was also identified by others, but
was not examined touching the crime with which he stands
charged. Several witnesses, however, were examined in
the case in private, and Mr. Daniel Payne, the lover of the
girl, who said he had boarded with a Mr. Morse, an engrav-
er, in James st. but had not seen to converse with him for a
year or more—went to see and ascertain if he were the same
—the result of which did not transpire. Morse assumes
considerable apathy and composure, and maliciously insinu-
ated that the gentlemen who identified him must have been
guilty of the murder themselves, and to <u>exonorate</u> themselves
charged it upon him. He will be examined to-day at the
Upper Police before the Mayor and Justice Taylor in the
presence of the counsel he may select.
   Morse is a rather short but somewhat strongly built man,
with handsome black whiskers, very neatly and fashionably
dressed, has been exceedingly licentious in his conduct, the
companion of gamblers, and sometimes a gambler himself.—
He was a frequent inmate of the store of Mr. Anderson when
tended by Miss Rogers, and evidently knew her well. It is
well understood that, if guilty, he was not alone in the viola-
tion and murder, as the evidence at the inquest and of Dr.
Cook before the Mayor conclusively prove that more than one
were concerned.
   To discover and arrest these accomplices is now the busi-
ness and duty of the Police, though no evidence is yet ob-
tained to fix the guilt on any others. The evidence against
Morse is his being seen with the young lady in the evening
shortly before her death—his absence from home all that
night—his having left home a day after, clandestinely getting
his three trunks from his house to his office, then into a cab,
and flying from the city the day after the body was discov-
ered, and leaving his business—his changing his name when
away, and the letter written to him at Worcester by his
friend in this city, advising a change of dress, cutting off his
whiskers, &c. More, however, will doubtless be elicited to
strengthen suspicion. One of his apprentices applied yes-
terday to the Police Office to have his indentures canceled,
as his master was absent, and was astonished to find him in
prison charged with murder. To Justice Taylor, who man-
aged this business, aided by the Mayor, and to the officer
who went in pursuit, great praise is due for the judicious
manner in which they conducted the affair to a successful re-
sult. Whatever additional information is elicited we shall
hasten to lay before our readers.

		<m8>Reported for the Courier & Enquirer.</m8>
   <i>Police.—The Case of Mary C. Rogers</i>.—Officer
Hilliker of the Upper Police Office, arrived in town
yesterday morning, having in custody <i>Joseph W.
Morse</i>, a wood engraver of this city, whose office is
at 120 Nassau street, and who stands charged with
having participated in the murder of Mary C. Rog-
ers. The circumstances which first fixed suspicion
upon the accused, and eventually led to his arrest,
are as follows.
   On Sunday the 25th July, in the morning, he left
his home in Thompson street, saying that he was go-
ing to Hoboken. He started and did not return un-
til Monday night, when he only remained about an
hour, during which time he was in a high state of ex-
citement. While at home on Monday night, he beat
and abused his wife shamefully, and on Tuesday
morning she went before Justice Taylor and made a
complaint of his conduct, upon which he issued a
warrant for his arrest. This was given to Hilliker to
serve, who went to his office and not finding him in,
he left a note stating the object of his calling. The
next day, Hilliker went down again, and then learn-
ed that he had left the city in a very clandestine man-
ner on Tuesday afternoon, 27th July.
   After the discovery of the body of Miss Rogers,
Justice Taylor heard that two persons were in the
city, who had seen Mary at Hoboken on Sunday
afternoon with a young man, and on sending for and
examining those persons, they described Morse so
accurately, that no doubt remained of his being the
man. They also described the girl with such fidelity
that Mrs. Rogers said it must have been her daughter,
and under these circumstances Justice Taylor deter-
mined upon the arrest of Morse, as a participator in
the murder of Miss Rogers.
   Hilliker was accordingly despatched, armed at all
points with affidavits, &c., and proceeded first to Bos-
ton. There he could learn no trace of Morse, and
he then started for Worcester, where he found many
Morses on the hotel books but not the one he
sought after. At that place he found a letter in the
Post Office addressed to Morse, which he opened,
and which was written by a friend in this city, ad-
vising him to shave off his whiskers, and not to wear
his Panama Hat, or Prince Albert Coat, as officers
were after him who only knew him by description.
Upon making enquiries around, Hilliker found that
there was a young man at Holden, about 7 miles
from Worcester named Morse and he accordingly
proceeded thither, and soon had the satisfaction of
seeing the real simon pure, whom he at once arrested.
   Another circumstance, which came to the know-
ledge of the Police, the week before last, is singular
as connected with the arrest of Morse. On the Tues-
day afternoon that he left the city, a young gentle-
man of this city, who was on board the Norwich
boat, fell in with Morse on board, and in the course
of conversation he told this stranger a queer story
about his having taken a girl over to Staten Island on
Sunday, the 25th, and of the manner in which he had
treated her. The gentleman returned to New York
immediately, and hearing then for the first time of
the murder of Mary Rogers, the story told by Morse
came to his mind, and he promptly communicated it
by letter to Justice Merritt, of Hoboken, but by some
mishap the letter remained in this city four or five
days before it reached the Justice, but when it was
received, it was considered as one link in the chain
of evidence against Morse.
   On reaching the city yesterday, Morse was taken
to the upper Police Office, and was placed in a room
with ten or twelve other persons. The gentleman
who had seen him at Hoboken on the fatal Sunday,
was then shown into the room, and he immediately
singled out Morse as the man. The Mayor was im-
mediately sent for, and he together with Justice Tay-
lor, was engaged nearly all of yesterday taking testi-
mony in the case. What the nature of that testimo-
ny was is unknown to the Reporter, but he is assured
that the circumstantial evidence against Morse is very
strong indeed, and that very great efforts alone can
succeed in taking the odium from him.
   As many persons have wondered and asked what
could have induced Mary to go to Hoboken, on Sun-
day, it may as well be stated that she had frequently
been there without the knowledge of her mother or
friends. On the Sunday previous to the 25th July
she was over there, and on Wednesday preceding
that. She was there also, both times, without the
knowledge of her mother or friends, at least until she
had returned.
   As far as the Reporter has been able to ascertain,
the evidence is deemed very strong against Morse in
this matter, but there are other circumstances which
may as well be mentioned now. The letter above
mentioned, as being intercepted at Worcester, was
written by one of his apprentices, who was of course
knowing to his absence, and also to the efforts made
to arrest him. Another apprentice on Monday after-
noon went to the lower Police office to have his in-
dentures cancelled, stating that his master had gone
suddenly away, and as he knew not whether he
would ever return, he desired to be free from further
service. He was directed to call yesterday morning,
which he did and then for the first time learned of
Morse's arrest and imprisonment here. The appren-
tice, who gave Morse the warning, was brought up
yesterday to be examined, but of the nature of his
testimony we are not informed.
   On the other hand it is known that Morse on Sun-
day morning went to a barber in Ann street, and ask-
ed him to go to Hoboken with him, which he pro-
mised to do, but was prevented by business. On
Monday Morse called again for him to go, and he had
with him a very large and favorite dog, which he said
he wished to exercise, but the barber would not go,
and Morse went alone. On Tuesday morning he
called once more at the barber's and said he was go-
ing to leave the city for a short time; that he had
trouble with his wife, and feared she would get out a
warrant against him, and he promised to write to him
soon. Morse may have gone off under apprehension
of trouble from his wife, and also on account of pecu-
niary difficulties.
   Thus stands the affair at present. If the girl seen
with Morse at Hoboken on Sunday was not Mary C.
Rogers, he can easily prove that. If, however, he
cannot disprove the evidence thus far given against
him, he stands a fair chance for being at least tried
for murder. He is committed for further examina-
tion which will take place this day.

o'clock in the morning, and published it in less than
an hour afterwards.
	...
   In Wall street, it was hardly possible to get one
of the speculators to talk upon the subject. John
Targee met Stephen Whitney, and said: “Well,
Steve, what do you think of the veto?” “There's
nothing in it, nothing in it, sir,” said Stephen Whit-
ney, “I don't care any thing about it.” A rich
locofoco next met another bank whig, and asked
him, “How do you like the veto?” The answer
was, “Ah! how do you do? Good morning!
Who's that man they have arrested for the murder
of Mary Rogers?” and he passed on.

		<b>The Mysterious Murder.</b>
   The publication which we made yesterday, of the
examination of Dr. Cook, of Hoboken, before the
Mayor, produced a thrill of horror throughout the
community, and has increased the intensity of the
holy excitement on the awful murder of Miss Rogers.
It far surpasses the curiosity to see the Veto Mes-
sage.
   The evidence thus far shows to every one that it
was without exception, the most horrid barbarity
that ever was perpetrated in any savage community,
to say nothing of the melancholy fact that such a
deed should have been committed in New York—in
a christian city—with legal institutions—a system of
morals and of laws—and all the elements of civiliza-
tion in full action.
   We have no doubt that our very efficient Mayor
will exert himself to the utmost, and also the police
under his authority work to the same length—but
the apathy of the police for a week after that brutal
butchery shows that we require an immediate re-
form in that branch of the public service, as well as
in the Court of Sessions.
   The sensation which all these developments have
made upon the community is most intense. All are
waking up from the dream of security, and the de-
moralized clubs of soaplocks and rowdies, which yet
hover around the city, are exciting the attention of
the people in all directions. Our system of educa-
tion, as well as that of the police, and of the admin-
istration of justice, is wrong in many essential parti-
culars. There exists no parental authority over
young men of thirteen to twenty of any kind. As-
sociating in clubs, gangs, or squads, they are as law-
less and barbarous as the savages of the Loo Choo
Islands. The hells, gaming houses, houses of ill-
fame, are permitted to exist unmolested by the judi-
cial authorities, and to corrupt and demoralize all
the youthful population of the city.
   While the community at large is justly excited on
this subject, there is also a certain portion of the
press engaged in the very suspicious business of con-
cealing all evidence, palliating all efforts to ferret
out the perpetrators, and abusing those who assist
the authorities. Do not these gamblers, blacklegs,
soaplocks, and wicked portion of youth procure this
course of policy, in order to preserve their confeder-
ates from being brought to justice? It really ap-
pears to be so—and it ought to be inquired into. At
all events, no honest man—no good citizen—no
Christian will ever relax in this holy excitement, till
the foul perpetrators be discovered and brought to
justice.
   With these remarks, we annex what <u title="further">furthur</u> par-
ticulars we can procure.
		F<small>URTHER</small> P<small>ARTICULARS</small>.
   T<small>HE YOUNG MAN</small> C<small>ARTER</small>.—We were informed
yesterday, by the father of this young man, that he
left the city on the 1st of June. Of course the inqui-
ry of a correspondent the other day, whether he was
acquainted with the girl, or any of the parties, is set
at rest.
   A<small>NOTHER</small> I<small>NQUIRY</small>.—A correspondent inquires
what is the reason that Mrs. Rogers, the mother of
the girl, has not been examined—nor the house they
resided in, been searched and also examined? We
know not—but we suppose everything will be done
that ought to be done.
   A<small>RREST OF A</small> P<small>ERSON</small> S<small>USPECTED OF THE</small> M<small>URDER OF</small>
M<small>ARY</small> R<small>OGERS</small>.—On Sunday evening officer <u title="Hilliker (elsewhere)">Hel-
liker</u>, of the Upper Police, arrested a man of the
name of Morse, on suspicion of having violated and
murdered Mary C. Rogers at Hoboken, on the 25th
of July. This man had been for some days staying
at Worcester, Mass., which place he left last week.
The next day a letter arrived directed to him, which
fell into the hands of the officer, who immediately
proceeded to West <u title="Boylston">Boyleston</u>, seven miles from
Worcester, where he was fortunate enough to fall
in with the man he was in pursuit of, and they both
arrived here by the steamboat Worcester yesterday
(Tuesday) morning. This person proves to be Jo-
seph W. Morse, well known as a wood engraver,
carrying on business at No. 120 Nassau street. It is
said that he had some quarrels with his wife, who
complained to the Police magistrates of this ill treat-
ment of her, and that he left the city suddenly about
the time when Mary Rogers was first missed. The
grounds on which the suspicion of his being a par-
ticipator in this horrid act of violation and murder,
have not been disclosed by the magistrates.
   Morse was taken to the Upper Police, whither
the Mayor immediately proceeded, but no examina-
tion took place, although if it had, it was to have
been <i>au sécrét</i>. We were present in the afternoon
when a member of the bar, who announced himself
as the friend, as well as <i>legal adviser</i>, of Mr. Morse,
was refused permission to see the prisoner by Jus-
tice Taylor, who said at the same time that no ex-
amination, or other procedure, would be taken un-
til this (Wednesday) morning at 10 o'clock.
   We believe that the interception of a letter at
Worcester, led to the arrest of Morse, but we do not
pretend to know the contents thereof, or whether
the letter was got hold of by the Postmaster or the
officer. One of the evening papers gave the follow-
ing as the solution of this mysterious missive:—
   “The immediate cause of the arrest of the pri-
soner, was a letter received at the Worcester post
office addressed to him. The postmaster, apprised
of the suspicion which attached to a man bearing
the name with which the letter was superscribed,
opened it. The contents were of great importance;
being in fact a warning to the individual in question,
that the police were in close pursuit of him, and that
he had better shave off his whiskers, change his
dress and shift his quarters forthwith.”
   Another <i>on dit</i> which got afloat was, that when
first spoken to by the officer, Morse asked what he
was to go to New York for?
   To which the officer replied, “On the complaint
of your wife.”
   And then Morse rejoined, “Oh! is that all.”
   And the officer should then say, “Yes, also for the
murder of Miss Rogers,” at which information Mr.
<u title="Morse">Mose</u> is said to have refused to come voluntarily un-
til threatened with a requisition from the Governor
of the State, which threat changed his resolution.
   We give these flying reports for what they are
worth, but we were assured by a gentleman who
came in the same boat, that Morse appeared calm
and collected, and that he did not manifest any of
the outward and visible signs of guilt which might
be expected from one accused of such a mass of
crime.
   A few hours must, however, clear up some of this
mystery.<a id="Herald-1841-08-18-Daniel-Payne-on-fatal-Sunday"></a>
   With respect to the <u title="whereabouts">whereabnots</u> of Mr. Daniel
Payne on the fatal Sunday, the following affidavit
has been made:—
<m9>   City and County of New York, the sixteenth day of
August, one thousand eight hundred and forty-one, I,
Thomas D. Bickford, do swear, that Daniel Payne was in
my house on Sunday, the twenty-fifth day of July last,
between the hours of one and two o'clock, and also be-
tween the hours of eight and nine o'clock in the even-
ing of the same day.			THOS. D. BICKFORD.
   Sworn to before me, this 16th August, 1841.
		W<small>M</small>. H. H<small>ARNED</small>, Commissioner of Deeds.</m9>
   Mr. John Payne, the brother of Mr. Daniel Payne,
has also testified, in another affidavit, that the latter
left him at the Battery at a quarter or half past 7
o'clock, for the purpose of proceeding to Bickford's.
   The affidavits of Mrs. Rogers, the mother, and
Mrs. Hayes and Mrs. Downing, the aunts of Mary,
together with several others, fully account for every
remaining hour and even half hour of the day; but
none of them explain why the betrothed and attached
friend of a beautiful girl, permits her to remain out
in that pitiless storm, without going to Mrs. Down-
ing's to see if she was safe or not.

the neighborhood of Cincinnati, were arrested by Prince
John, at the corner of Centre and Anthony streets, on the
complaint of one Abraham Johnson, who charged the Ger-

chance or other. The four gamblers were transferred to
the tombs, but in the course of the morning Marks was
taken before Judge Lynch, or some other high legal
functionary, and the whole gang liberated on bail.
   Johnson's story was that he had been victimized by this

   A<small>RREST OF THE</small> S<small>UPPOSED</small> M<small>URDERERS OF</small>
M<small>ISS</small> R<small>OGERS</small>.—The well directed efforts of the
Mayor and police authorities, prejudged, as they
have been, by the wholly uncalled-for and really
mischievous interference of busy intermeddlers,
have at last been successful in tracing out and ar-
resting two individuals, against whom suspicion
of implication in the horrible outrage upon the
person, and final murder, of Miss Rogers, rests
with a fearful degree of warrant. The names of
the persons arrested, are Joseph W. Morse, a wood
engraver, late of No. 120 Nassau street, and a man
of family, and an individual named <u>Cromeline</u>, of
whose occupation or residence, we are uninform-
ed. We learn, however, that he was formerly a
suitor of Miss Rogers, and that she was at one
time seriously attached to him; but, owing to a
quarrel which arose between them for some cause
or other, they had in a great measure become es-
tranged from each other.
   The circumstances which led to the suspicion
and arrest of these persons are in substance as fol-
lows:—A few days after the body of Miss Rogers
was found on the Hoboken shore, Mrs. Morse, the
wife of the arrested person, applied at the upper
police office for a warrant against her husband for
an assault and battery, which, she alleged, he
committed upon her on the evening of the Sun-
day on which Miss Rogers disappeared.
   In relating the circumstances attending the
cause of her complaint, Mrs. Morse stated that
her husband had been long in the habit of treat-
ing her in an improper and cruel manner; that
he was absent from home during the Sunday
in question; that he returned home late at
night, and his manner, appearance, &c. was
very confused and unusually agitated. She
questioned him as to the cause of his absence,
and singular appearance, to which he replied that
it was none of her business, applied to her a vile
epithet, and, by a blow with his fist knocked her
down. She also mentioned that she noticed the
head of his cane had become broken during his
absence. A few days afterwards—(the day after
the discovery of Miss Rogers' body)—he left home
and had not since been seen by his family; or any
of his friends, as far as his wife was aware; and
her object was to get out a warrant for his arrest
for the assault and battery, and by this means ob-
tain the aid of the police in hunting up and recov-
ering her recusant husband.
   This singular correspondence of time stated by
Mrs. Morse, together with other particulars con-
nected with her story, induced Justice Taylor, to
whom she made her complaint, to question her par-
ticularly as to the personal appearance of her hus-
band and his dress at the time; and the descrip-
tion she gave of him resembled so precisely
that of a person seen by two gentlemen of this city
in company with a young lady, at Hoboken, on
the fatal Sunday evening, and who had also re-
cognized portions of the dress found upon the per-
son of Miss Rogers as those worn by that young
lady, that Mr. Taylor believed the absence and
conduct of Morse at that time might have some
connexion with or bearing upon the murder of that
ill-fated girl. Under this impression, he advised
Mrs. Morse to take out, instead of a warrant for the
assault and battery, one for the abandonment;
and she, following his advise, such a warrant was
issued upon a suitable affidavit made by her.
   Justice Taylor then proceeded to Morse's estab-
lishment in Nassau street, and there found his ap-
prentice, whom he questioned touching the ab-
sence and whereabouts of his master, and from
whom he succeeded in drawing out the fact that
Morse was probably in or about Worcester, Mass.
To that place an officer was despatched, attended
by the gentleman who had given the informa-
tion to the police relative to what he had observed
pass between a male and female at Hoboken on
the fatal Sunday evening, who went for the pur-
pose of identifying Morse, if he was the same man.
At the post office at West Boylston, about seven
miles from Worcester, he was taken into custody
as he was in the act of receiving a letter—which
was immediately opened and found to have been
written in New York—advising him to shave off
his whiskers, and disguise himself as much as
possible, as the police were on the look-out for
him.
   <u>This letter was written by Cromeline, and was
the cause of his arrest in this city last evening</u>.—
Morse was brought to the city yesterday morning
in the steamer Worcerster, and immediately con-
veyed to the upper police office, where he was
placed in close custody.
   His Honor the Mayor and Justice Taylor were
indefatigably engaged yesterday in further <u>investi-
ogating</u> this horrible, and still in a great measure
mysterious affair; but as it is all-important to the
promotion of the ends of justice that such disclo-
sures as they may succeed in eliciting should not
be placed in the possession of others who may be,
and are believed to be, implicated in this diaboli-
cal outrage, it is not proper they should be
given to the four winds of heaven through the pub-
lic press. When we have the authority of the ef-
ficient, sagacious, and tireless public officers, who
have by their energy and perseverance succeeded
in obtaining what is believed to be the true clue to
the whole dreadful mystery, to lay further deve-
lopments and more minute particulars before the
public, we shall do so at the earliest practicable
moment.

seven sworn affidavits, which furnish a connected and
consistent account of his movements during the whole
of Sunday the 25th of July, the day on which the
unfortunate Mary C. Rogers left her home, and was,
no doubt, murdered. No one can read the affidavits
without feeling that Mr. Payne stands exonerated
from even a shadow of suspicion. In a former article
we stated that his whereabouts during the interval
between the hours of seven and nine on the evening
of the 25th, was not clearly accounted for. The affi-
davit of Mr. Bickford, which we append, settles that
question.

   T<small>HE</small> E<small>XAMINATIONS RELATIVE TO THE</small> M<small>URDER OF</small> M<small>ISS</small>
R<small>OGERS</small>.—The Mayor and Justice Parker were yesterday
diligently engaged at the Upper Police office up to a late hour
in the afternoon in the examination of witnesses, touching the
guilt or innocence of Joseph W. Morse, suspected of the mur-
der of Miss Mary C. Rogers. A number of witnesses brought
in by the officers Hilliker and Parker were examined and
discharged—but as the examination was in secret, we are
unable to state as to what new facts, if any, were elicited.
Morse's examination was deferred to another day, owing to
the necessary absence, for a short time, of the Mayor. He
will probably however be examined this day. A private ex-
amination of the mother of the murdered girl, conducted with
great delicacy out of respect to her age, infirmities and afflic-
tions—was had at her residence, for the ascertainment of
certain facts. That lady is now some 70 years of age, and
is literally borne down with sorrow. It is said that some
years since her husband was blown up in a steamboat on the
Mississippi and killed; that her son, who rented the house
in Nassau-street, was some months ago knocked overboard
from a vessel in leaving this port and drowned; and now her
only solace and support, her lovely daughter, being brutally
murdered, presses grief heavily upon her heart, and drives
“the iron deep into her soul.” The state of mind to which
she has been driven by her multiplied afflictions, added to
her age and infirmities, furnish sufficient excuses for her not
visiting her daughter's grave at Hoboken, or attending at the
Police office to interest herself in the investigations going on.
The public we hope will deeply commiserate her condition,
and reserve their censures for more befitting subjects.
   There are various out-of-door rumors in relation to Morse,
which we cannot trace to any authentic source, and theretofore
withhold them from our readers. All facts we will be careful
to present, but cannot descend to fictions to gratify even a
laudable anxiety for news.

   <i>The case of Mary C. Rogers</i>.—Our readers will

fied the body of this unfortunate girl, and who was
most instrumental in stimulating the pursuits of this
Police after her murderers, was a <u>gentlemen</u> of the
name of A<small>LFRED</small> C<small>ROMMELIN</small>, residing at No. 19 John
street. We are astonished to learn from him, that
some of the penny papers have in their reports of the
affair, most unaccountably connected his name with
that of the man now in confinement on suspicion of
having committed the murder. It no doubt must
have been by mistake; at any rate, in justice to Mr.
C<small>ROMMELIN</small>, we would say that Mr. G<small>ILBERT</small> M<small>ER-
RITT</small>, the Magistrate and Coroner of Hoboken, and
Dr. <u>C<small>OOKE</small></u>, foreman of the Coroner's Inquest held on
the body, have both borne testimony in writing to
the philanthropic exertions of Mr. C<small>ROMMELIN</small>; that
he does not know the man now in custody, and that
he has been only mixed up with the judicial proceed-

such an atrocious act should not be perpetrated in
this community and go unpunished.

			POLICE—Wednesday.
   <i>The case of Mary C. Rogers</i>.—The Mayor and
Justice Taylor, were engaged the whole of yesterday,
taking testimony in this exciting case, but we have
no intimation of the nature of the testimony, except
that it in nowise exculpates Morse. On the contra-
ry, every thing that has thus far been discovered
tends to confirm this suspicion of his having partici-
pated in the outrage upon Miss Rogers. It will be
several days before the testimony against Morse can
be completed, until when every thing must remain a
mystery, the Magistrates being <s>unwilling</s> to give any
thing for publication, which may <s>???????</s> with the
ends of justice. Rumors in abundance are afloat,
which, however, we <s>prefer</s> to <s>wait</s>.
   <s>We have very few new facts to communicate to-
day, but we may as well notice one or two contradic-
tory statements made by Morse. On being brought

woful <s>fibber</s> at the <s>least</s>, for on Monday night when
he returned home he told his wife that he had been
to Hoboken, and being caught in the shower, he had
staid over night. These stories do not match very
well.
   When officer Hilliker went to arrest him on Tues-
day morning on the complaint of his wife, he saw
the two apprentices there, one of whom told him,
that Morse was out, when in fact it has been since
ascertained, that he was then lying asleep in the
back room, having given orders to his boys to deny
him to every person except two gentlemen, whom he
named. The eldest apprentice, who wrote the letter
to him at Worcester, has been arrested, and will be
examined during the week. It is not true that Mr.
Crommelin, has been arrested on the charge of hav-
ing written a letter to Mr. Morse, nor has any other
arrest been made, except such as may be necessary
as evidence.

   Williams, the English swindler, now in prison on a
charge of defrauding Messrs. E. <s>Pricener</s> of 30 baskets
of champagne, had another complaint against him by
Messrs. Smith, of Broadway, from whom he managed
to get 44 yards of carpeting for his office in Exchange
Place, by means of his enamelled cards and brazen
impudence. He refused to answer any question up-
on the subject, and is committed for trial. He goes
on to Boston for trial, this day.

   Peter Jackson, a colored man, was arrested by
watchman Valentine, having in his possession a bag
of drugs neatly packed up. As he could give no good
account of himself, he was remanded for further ex-
amination.

   John Herrick was caught stealing a box of segars
worth $12, from the store door of T. A. & S. Hope,
corner of Chambers-street and West Broadway, and
was locked up for trial.

Mary Rogers:—
<m9>   My own opinion is that she was murdered, not at Ho-
boken, but in this city; and I have a suspicion that her
death was not the result of malice or outrage, but of
some of the infernal practices to procure <i>abortion</i>, for
which our city has for some years been notorious. This
is a suspicion only; but I am confident that if her lover,
Payne, would frankly tell all he knows, it would be
easy to trace out this horrible affair.</m9>

<b>The Arrest of the supposed Murderer of Mary
			C. Rogers.</b>
   We have already stated that Mr. Hilliker, the offi-
cer has arrested at Holden, near Worcester, Mas-
sachusetts, Mr. Morse, the wood engraver, of 120
Nassau street, as the supposed murderer of Mary C.
Rogers.
   The Mayor and Justice Taylor were all day yes-
terday engaged in taking testimony from the Barber,
corner Theatre Alley and Beekman street, Mr. But-
ler, the engraver, Mr. Travis, a tailor, and two or
three others; all which tend to foster guilt upon
Morse.
   All the examinations were strictly private, and the
Mayor has forbidden any publication of what tran-
spired on the subject.
   The wife of Morse says, that he was not at home on
the Sunday night when Mary Rogers was murdered;
two respectable witnesses confirm her statement.
He came home on Monday night in a state of great
excitement, and beat his wife, and cleared out that
night. This led to his arrest. Justice Taylor says,
that up to this hour they have not been able to find
any one who knows <i>where Morse was on the fatal
Sunday night</i>.
   In explanation of where he spent that fatal Sun-
day, Morse says this:—
   “On Sunday, the 25th of July, I met a young lady
about noon, in Bleecker street, near <u title="Morton">Norton</u> street.—
She was dressed in black; I had met her before, and
persuaded her to go with me to Staten Island. We
went there; to the Pavilion, had some refreshments,
and I kept her mind employed till after the last boat
started. I then persuaded her to agree to pass the night
with me and to sleep in the same room. She did so;
I tried to have connexion with her in the night, but
did not succeed. On Monday morning I came to
the city with her, and left her in good friendship at
the corner of Greenwich and Barclay street. This
was ½ past 11 A. M. I have not seen her since. I
don't know her name. I think she lives in Morton
street, with her mother. I think the house where
she lives has a brass plate on the door, with cypher
letters on it. I don't know the name on it. <i>Her
name might be Mary Rogers</i>. I<small>F IT WAS</small> I <small>HAD NO
HAND IN MURDERING HER</small>! as I left her in good feeling.
Her hair was rather light. Her complexion light.
I think her <u>eye brows</u> were rather dark. She was
slender made; of very genteel appearance; rather
tall and thin; she told me she was 17 years of age;
she had a very long, delicate hand, but no rings on
her fingers. She said she was going to board at the
Seminary at Staten Island. This is all I know about
her.”
   We can only add to this that Morse appeared
cheerful up to last night. The Mayor went down
to Staten Island about 4 P.M. and had not returned
at 10 P.M. We shall have more details to-day.

   T<small>HE ARREST</small> of an individual named <u>Cromelin</u>
mentioned by us yesterday in connexion with that
of Morse, for his supposed participation in the late
dreadful tragedy at Hoboken, proves to be a mis-
take. No person by that name has been arrested,
nor, as far as now appears, was the author of the
letter putting Morse on his guard against the po-
lice. The Boston Transcript says, in reference to
that letter, that “on being opened in the presence
of Morse, it was found to be from Daniel Payne,
the intended husband of Miss Rogers.” On the
other hand, it is attributed by some of the papers
here, to an apprentice of Morse's. From the va-
riety of conflicting reports on this important point
it is most probable the author of the letter remains
unknown, or, at least, his name undivulged by the
police. Whoever may have been the author of it,
it may, after all, have been written wholly in re-
ference to the prosecution instituted by Mrs.
Morse, and without any reference whatever to
any suspicion entertained against him in the seri-
ous implication resting against him. That he was
most decidedly inclined to unlink himself from
future companionship with his wife, appears very
evident; and we do not see anything in the man-
ner of his leaving the city, and the provisions he
made for remaining away a length of time, incon-
sistent with the possibility that the purpose of
separating himself from his wife might have been
his only inducement in absenting himself.
   Among all the numerous reports relating to him
which are rumored from mouth to mouth, or have
found their way into the public prints, there are
but two which, if totally true, militate at all
against the supposition of innocence to which he is
entitled by law and common humanity, until his
guilt is established. The most serious circum-
stance alleged against him is, that he was with
Miss Rogers shortly before the evening on which
she is believed to have met her cruel fate. This
is by no manner of means conclusive that he did
not part from her before she fell into the hands of
her ravishers and murderers; or that he may not
be as perfectly innocent of participation in, or
even knowledge of, the horrors of the evening, as
any other individual. The second is a circum-
stance related in the Courier—which may or may
not be true, though, unquestionably, it was be-
lieved to be so by the author of the publica-
tion. It is stated by that paper, that on the Tues-
day afternoon that Morse left the city, a young gen-
tleman of this city who was on board the
Norwich boat, fell in with Morse on board, and in
the course of conversation Morse told this stranger
a queer story about his having taken a girl over
to Staten Island on Sunday, the 25th, and of the
manner in which he had treated her. The gentle-
man returned to New York immediately, and
hearing then for the first time of the murder of
Mary Rogers, the story told by Morse came to his
mind, and he promptly communicated it by letter
to Justice <u>Merrit</u>, of Hoboken, but by some mishap
the letter remained in this city four or five days be-
fore it reached this Justice, but when it was re-
ceived, it was considered as one link in the chain
of evidence against Morse.
   This very circumstance of being at Staten Isl-
and on the Sunday in question, is, we understand,
repeated by Morse now. In relation to his ab-
senting himself from the city, he says that he can
satisfactorily account for his doing so when the
proper time arrives, and says he was at Staten Isl-
and on the afternoon of the Sunday on which it is
said he was at Hoboken. He also endeavors to
create an impression that the men who pretend to
identify him were concerned in the murder them-
selves, and want to save themselves by accusing
him. On the other hand, the Tattler says, it is
known that Morse invited an acquaintance—a bar-
ber in Ann street—to go to Hoboken with him on
Sunday and on Monday, on both of which days
the friend declined to go. On Tuesday morning
Morse called once more at the barber's and said
he was going to leave the city for a short time;
that he had trouble with his wife and feared she
would get out a warrant against him, and he pro-
mised to write to him soon.
   On the whole, we can sift from amongst the
mass of things printed and rumored on the all ex-
citing subject, little to rely upon, and quite as lit-
tle that is very material <i>in itself</i>, if true, though
each particular may eventually prove an import-
ant link in the chain of mystery yet to be unra-
velled. The examination of Morse, which com-
menced yesterday morning, at the upper police
is strictly private. If sufficient evidence is found
against him to commit him for trial, the public will,
till then, probably be ignorant of any evidence
which may be adduced, as the Magistrates enga-
ged in the examination very properly and judi-
ciously decline showing <i>ex parte</i> versions of the
matter elicited to get before the public to the pre-
judice either of the prisoner or of public justice.

	<b>The Murder of Miss Rogers.</b>
   The body of this unfortunate girl was
yesterday, at the request of our city au-
thorities, disinterred and brought from
Jersey to this city, and deposited in the
dead house in the Park. And difficult
would it be for the most imaginative
mind to conceive a spectacle more hor-
rible or humiliating to humanity.—
There lay, what was but a few days
back, the image of its Creator, the love-
liest of his works, and the tenement of
an immortal soul, now a blackened and
decomposed mass of putrefaction, pain-
fully disgusting to sight and smell. Her
skin which had been unusually fair was
now black as that of a negro. Her
eyes so sunk in her swollen face as to
have the appearance of being violently
forced beyond the sockets, and her
mouth, which “no friendly hand had
closed in death,” was distended as wide
as the ligaments of the jaws would ad-
mit, and wore the appearance of a person
who had died from suffocation or stran-
gulation. The remainder of her person
was alike one mass of putrefaction and
corruption, on which the worms were rev-
elling at their will. And as if nothing
should be wanting to send the moral
home to men's hearts, and render it more
painfully <u title="'impressive' in Evening Post">oppressive</u>, the young man
who was to have been, in a few days,
married to her, now stood beside the
rough box in which all that remained of
her he loved was lying. Her whom but
a few days back, he had seen, “exulting
in her youth,” filled with life, hope and
animation, whom he so ardently wished
to make his wedded wife, to fold to his
bosom, to press to “his heart of hearts,”
now lay before him an inanimate mass
of matter, so hideous, horrible and offen-
sive, that the bare idea of coming in
contact with it was almost sufficient to
make the gorge rise. The remains even
of her dress, in which she had been
buried, were already so discolored and
half rotten, as to render it almost impos-
sible to be identified, and was so impreg-
nated with the effluvia from her person,
that scarcely any person would venture
to touch or examine it.
   The chief object in bringing the body
over to this city, was that it might be
identified beyond all doubt, which it ap-
pears had not been hitherto done, at least
to the satisfaction of our city authori-
ties, until yesterday. Amongst the
strangest and most mysterious circum-
stances of the murder, is perhaps the
fact that from the hour she last left her
mother's door, to the time when her body
<d>[Col.6]</d>
was found floating in the river, no trace
whatever of her has been discovered, nor
can any person be found who, for one
moment saw her, in that interim.
   Justices Parker and Merritt and Mr.
<u title="Callender">Calender</u>, clerk of the <u title="'Police' in Evening Post">Post</u> Office, at-
tended at the dead house, for several
hours yesterday evening for the purpose
of further examining the matter, but
they were unable to elicit more than had
been already known. In the course of
the evening a coffin was procured, into
which the unfortunate girl's remains
were removed from the rough box in
which they had been buried, and they
still remain in the dead house in the
Park.—<i>N. Y. Journal of Com., Aug.</i> 11.<f>

   C<small>ASE OF</small> J<small>OS.</small> W. M<small>ORSE</small>—<i>Arrested for the sup-
posed Murder of Mary C. Rogers</i>.—On the 22d
July the wife of Morse complained at the Upper
Police office that her husband had beaten her the
night before. Officer Hilliker, with a warrant,
went to Morse's Office, 120 Nassau street, saw his
two apprentices to the wood engraving business,
asked for Mr. Morse, and was told by the older of
the two that Morse was not in, and could not say
where he could then be found. The officer left a
note for Morse to call upon him. At that time
Morse was asleep in his back office, as since ascer-
tained. On the succeeding Thursday, the same ap-
prentice told the officer that Morse had gone out of
town, but did not know to what place.
   Mr. Ireland, who occupies the second floor of 120
Nassau street, said that Morse had taken away his
trunks on the previous Tuesday.
   On Sunday evening, the officer called upon Mrs.
Morse, who said she had not seen her husband
since Monday night, when he left his house, No.
55 <u title="Greene (below)">Green</u> street. She said that he had not treated
her well; that as far back as Christmas he had left
off sleeping at home; except occasionally, generally
staying at his office; that on Friday night he slept
at home, and continued to live with her until Sunday
morning, the 25th July. He then told her and a
woman in the house that he had engagements at
Hoboken, and was going there. She did not see
him again until half-past 10 o'clock on Monday
night. Then he had a large dog with him. The
dog was wet. Said that he had just returned from
Hoboken—had staid there over night—that he had
been caught in a shower, which had detained him
over Sunday night, and the dog had on Monday
night been in the water. Morse was tired and ex-
cited—acted very strangely and went to bed. She
went to the pump for a pitcher of water, and on
her return found him dressing himself. Some
words passed—he said he was going out. She said
she would follow him if he did. He did go out, she
followed, and at the corner of Broome and Greene
street he struck her; since which she has not seen
him. These circumstances induced a suspicion in
Mr. Hilliker's mind that he knew something of the
murder. He mentioned the facts to Justice Taylor,
who concurred in opinion that Morse should be
searched for. Mr. Hilliker then called on the
mother of Miss Rogers, and received a description
of her daughter. The aunt of the young woman
stated that two gentlemen had seen at Hoboken,
on 25th July, between 6 and 7 o'clock in the even-
ing, a couple answering the description of Morse
and Miss Rogers as received by Hilliker from Mrs.
Morse and Mrs. Rogers. The officer then called on
these persons, and they made affidavits as to the
facts stated above before Justice Taylor. After this
Hilliker, was despatched to Boston, to which place
Morse was supposed to have gone, as his baggage
was sent to the Boston boat. It was supposed
Morse had gone to Nantucket, as his mother lived
there, but on examining the oldest apprentice, Ed-
ward Bookout, he stated under oath, that Morse had
directed him to write to him at Worcester. Mr.
Hilliker was too late for the Worcester line, and
proceeded to Boston, via Stonington. On Saturday
morning, 14th instant, Mr. Hilliker left Boston for
Worcester at 1 P. M. Arrived at 3, and immedi-
ately made arrangements with the Postmaster to
detain any letters addressed to Morse, until he
should hear from Hilliker.
   In a tavern at the outskirts of Worcester, Hilli-
ker heard of a Mr. Morse then being at Holden, 7
miles distant, who answered the description of J.
W. Morse. He then proceeded to Holden, and
soon after, about half-past nine P. M., Morse ap-
peared on the stoop, when Hilliker invited him to
the bar room, where one of the persons who it was
supposed had seen Morse at Hoboken, and who ac-
companied Hilliker, might have an opportunity to
see his features and dress. He was recognized
though his dress was changed.* On returning to
Worcester, the Postmaster produced the letter ex-
pected by Morse, which M. opened and then han-
ded to Hilliker.
   This letter was from the oldest apprentice, and
advised Morse to alter his dress and shave off his
whiskers, as the police was on the lookout for him.
Morse said that he was with a young girl at Staten
Island on the 25th July, but gave no name, and
said he did not know whether he could find her a-
gain. He had made a similar statement on his way
to Worcester, as appears by several affidavits. One
of the gentlemen who saw him at Hoboken, but not
the one who went on with Hilliker, had examined
the dress of Miss Rogers before Hilliker left for
Boston, and swore to it. His description tallies
with that of Mrs. Rogers. He has since seen Morse
and made affidavit as to his being the man seen
with the young woman at Hoboken. Neither of
these gentlemen knew Miss Rogers. The other
gentlemen describes the dress minutely. Another
person was told by Morse, before he left for Boston,
the same story about his having been at <i>Staten Isl-
and</i> with a young woman on the fatal Sunday, and
that he remained there until Monday.
   The evidence so far is certainly very strong a-
gainst him, and the worst feature of the whole mat-
ter is, that Morse does not demand to be examined.
It is to be hoped that all persons who saw him be-
tween Sunday and the day he left, will give the Ma-
gistrates information as early as possible.—<i>Stan-
dard</i>.
<m9>———
   * When arrested, he told Hilliker that he had been at Ho-
boken on the 25th July, with a young woman whom he had
met in Broadway by appointment, but next day afterwards
said he was at Staten Island not Hoboken.</m9>

   Joseph W. Morse, supposed to be one of the mur-

State a few days since, arrived at New York in the
custody of a Police officer on Tuesday, and was to
be examined the same day. He is a wood-engraver,
about 25 or 30 years of age, and like all rogues, is
said to be a very fine looking fellow. He fled from
New York the morning after Miss Rogers body was
discovered. The magistrates refuse to disclose yet
the manner in which suspicion was excited against
him. We presume the whole affair of this murder
will in some way, soon become public, revealing an
awful tale of guilt, and disclosing the most horrid
particulars.

   Nothing further of much importance has been

was examined before the New York Police, yester-

   E<small>XAMINATION IN THE</small> C<small>ASE OF</small> M<small>ISS</small> R<small>OGERS</small>.—The in-
vestigation into the case touching the murder of Miss Mary
C. Rogers was continued yesterday at the Upper Police
Office, before the Mayor and Justice Taylor, <i>in secret</i>, during
which several witnesses were examined, as also Morse, the
accused, himself. The latter having, as is understood—
(though we are not officially advised of the fact)—asserted
on Wednesday that he was not at Hoboken on Sunday, the
25th of July, and did not see Miss Rogers that day, but that
he was at Staten Island, and remained there during the
whole of Sunday night in company with <i>another</i> female,
aged about 17 years, of Morton-street,—the Mayor, late on
Wednesday afternoon, proceeded to Staten Island, and there
ascertained that a man resembling the accused had lodged
in a public house there that night, and that a genteel looking
young female was in company with him, and also lodged in
the same room with Morse. To prove the correctness or
falsity of this statement, Morse was induced to reveal the
name of the young lady, who, he said, resided in Morton-
street; and in the course of yesterday she was sought out,
found, brought to the Upper Police Office, and examined.—
She stated, as we unofficially informed, that she was
about 17 years of age—had seen Morse once before—be-
lieved him to be a single man; and that on Sunday, the 25th
of July, he met her in Bleecker-street, and persuaded her to
take an excursion with him to Staten Island; that they went
early in the afternoon, about 2 o'clock, to the Island,
where Morse contrived to while away the time with her un-
til the last boat had left, when he pressed her to stay and
lodge in the same room with him that night, which she re-
fused; but that on his threat to expose her, and on his plight-
ing his honor that he would not molest her, she consented
and did lodge in the same room with him, in separate beds;
that during the night he forfeited his pledge, and came to
her bed and proceeded to improper liberties, which she re-
sisted, and that he then proceeded to use force, but that she
successfully resisted all his efforts; that on Monday forenoon
they left the Island together and arrived in this city, when
he accompanied her as far as the corner of Barclay and
Greenwich-streets, when he left her and she returned home.
As corroborations of the statement of the young lady, as also
that of Morse in part, we understand that Messrs. <u title="John (elsewhere)">James</u>
Conner, William H. Hicks, R. <u title="Baker, Becker, Bucker (elsewhere)">Backer</u> and W. J. McKee
were examined, and all deposed that they saw Morse be-
tween 1 and 2 o'clock on Sunday afternoon, the 25th of July,
in Broadway, in company with a young lady, wending their
way towards the Battery, when one of the company, address-
ing one of the others, said, “There goes Morse with your
girl.”
   From these several confirmations of the story told by
Morse, and which go to prove an <i>alibi</i>, it is pretty clearly
established that the Police have been again deceived—that
Morse is not the man who was seen with Miss Rogers at
Hoboken, and that he is not guilty of that charge, whatever
else may be his sins. He is still, however, kept in custody,
as there are charges of assault and battery on his wife, and
of abandoning her yet against him. It is also rumored a
third charge has been or will be preferred, of the nature of
which we are not specifically advised. As Morse then had
been found to be <i>not</i> the murderer, the next question arises,
who is he? and where is he to be found? This, we appre-
hend, none, save the guilty and He who sees all things,
knows; but the Police are determined to endeavor still to
find out. The inquiry has been, thus far, confined to evi-
dence relative to the commission of the crime on <i>Sunday
evening</i>. Might it not, we ask, have been committed on
Monday, or Monday evening, or even as early as Sunday
before noon? We submit these questions for the authorities.

   ☞ Great care should be taken in calling names or impli-
cating persons in regard to the awful death of Mary C. Ro-
gers. The Sun's atrocious implication of Mr. <u>Cromeline</u>
has been paralleled by a similar misrepresentation in several
papers which speaks of “a barber in Ann-st.” as an ac-
quaintance and crony of Morse, and engaged to accompany
him to Hoboken. This is all wrong. The only barber in
Ann-st. is Mr. James Grant, a most worthy man, who knows
nothing of Morse. A barber in Beekman-st. was mentioned
in the testimony.

		POLICE—Thursday.
   <i>The case of Mary C. Rogers</i>.—We regret to state
that the outrage upon this unfortunate girl remains
as much a mystery as ever, evidence having been
yesterday adduced, proving unquestionably that
Morse had no hand in the murder of Miss Rogers,
although it was satisfactorily proved that he is a most
consummate scoundrel, and deserves, what he will
doubtless receive, the full measure of punishment,
which the law allows. Up to Wednesday night all
the testimony which had been taken at the Upper
Office on the subject, tended as far as accurate de-
scription could go, to fasten the strongest suspicion
upon him. He then, however, made a statement to
the magistrates to this effect; that he was at Staten
Island on Sunday the 25th July, in company with a
girl, whose name he did not know, but who lived in
Morton street. He also gave a minute description of
her dress, and with this information the Mayor pro-
ceeded to Staten Island, where, upon making enqui-
ry, he was satisfied that the statement of Morse was
in the main correct, and the only difficulty then was
to discover the girl, as even Morse did not know her
name or residence. This difficulty was got over yes-
terday morning, and the girl was produced before the
Mayor and Justice Taylor. She is rather a hand-
some girl, not yet 17 years of age, and appeared ter-
ribly affected in giving her statement, which was to
the following effect, and which proves her at best, a
very weak-minded girl, easily led astray. Her name
we of course suppress.
   She states that on Sunday afternoon, the 25th July,
he met her in Bleecker street, (he says by appoint-
ment, although he admits he never saw her but a few
times before,) and she was persuaded to go to Staten
Island with him. When they reached there, he ma-
naged to detain her until the last boat had left, and it
was found impossible to return to the city that night.
He then, by dint of threats that he would expose and
hold her name up to odium, and by other means, such
as might have been expected from a man like himself,
induced her to go to the hotel near the quarantine,
and stay for the night, and he promised most faithful-
ly that she should receive no harm at his hands. This
promise he violated, however, for after she had re-
tired, he used every argument he could think of, and
eventually some force, to accomplish his designs, in
which he was unsuccessful. In the morning they
returned to the city, and he left her between 10 and
11 o'clock, on the corner of Barclay and Greenwich
street.
   This is the substance of her statement, obtained
indirectly, for none of the papers have as yet been ex-
hibited to the reporters, and as there is abundance of
evidence to prove that he was with this girl on the
Sunday, 25th July, of course the accusation as to
having participated in the murder of Miss Rogers
falls to the ground. He will undoubtedly, however,
have to stand a trial for the attempt to commit a rape
upon this girl, and if convicted, there is no doubt
that he will suffer to the fullest extent of the law.
   Under these circumstances, the murder of Miss
Rogers is as great a mystery as ever, and we much
fear, that so much time has now elapsed since it
was committed, that the perpetrators will escape jus-
tice. Morse has not yet, however, been discharged
from the suspicion of murder, and will not be until
the statement of the girl is fully confirmed, to which
end the examination will be resumed this day.

   <i>Coroner's Office</i>.—The Coroner, yesterday, held an
inquest on the body of a lad aged 11 years, named
Robert Farrell, residing with his aunt at No. 42
Ridge street, who was drowned on Tuesday. He
went with other boys to the foot of <u title="Broome">Broom</u> street to
swim, and getting out of his depth, was drowned,
and his body was only recovered yesterday. Ver-
dict, accidentally drowned.
   Also, upon the body of Ambrose Morgan, aged 55,
found in the East River, near the foot of Delancey
street, having fallen into the river on Wednesday
night. He was heard shouting for help by some
persons on board the sloop Splendid, but before any
assistance could be rendered, he sank to rise no more.
Verdict, accidentally drowned.
   Also, upon an infant, the child of Mr. Robert Dun-
can, residing at No. 110 119th-street, who came to its
death by taking laudanum instead of paregoric, which
was intended and which was served out for that arti-
cle by a clerk in the drug store of Mr. Hinman, No.
145 Eighth Avenue. A witness testified to having
purchased the drug for paregoric, and administered it
to her own child, which fortunately sustained no in-
jury, and some of the same being administered to
Mr. Duncan's infant, it caused the death of the child
in a few hours. The jury returned a verdict in ac-
cordance with the above circumstances, and censured
in the most unmeasured terms the clerk who sold
the drug.
   Also, upon the body of Rebecca <u>Foohay</u>, residing
on the corner of West and <u>John</u> streets, who died of
<u title="apoplexy">apolexy</u> produced by intemperance. Verdict accor-
dingly.
   Also, upon the body of the young man, Jacob
Wirtz, who was drowned on Sunday evening last,
between 9 and 10 P. M. by falling from the Ferry
Boat, crossing from Hoboken. As the only testimo-
ny before the Coroner on this inquest, was that of a
friend to identify the body, and of the person who
picked up the body, we will state a fact connected
with the deceased, which has come to us from good
authority, and which deserves attention. A few
nights since, Wirtz was walking on the Battery
with two young ladies, to one of whom he was en-
gaged to be married, and as they were about going
out, a ruffianly fellow stepped up and remarked that
two girls was too much for one man, and that he
wanted one. Wirtz wishing to avoid any disturb-
ance, crossed over, but the ruffian followed him up,
and after abusing him struck him a violent blow.—
The watchmen and citizens have interfered and the
fellow was taken and confined in the watch house.
In the morning Wirtz made his complaint, and was
bound over to appear and prosecute the man. As it
is well known that gangs of lawless men infest the
Hoboken boats at night, would it not be worth en-
quiring if some of this fellow's friends were not on
board, and whether his falling overboard was purely
accidental? Surely some person must have been near
him when he was sitting on the rail of the boat, for
the boat was densely crowded on that occasion. We
merely throw out these suggestions for the action of
the proper authorities.

<b>The Murder of Mary C. Rogers—Further
	Particulars—Innocence of Morse.</b>
   This is one of the most extraordinary cases that
ever came before a criminal court in any country.
At the very moment that some scoundrels were rav-
ishing and murdering Mary Rogers at Hoboken or
New York, Morse was trying to seduce a girl at the
Pavilion at Staten Island.
   All our readers remember the statement we gave
yesterday, from Morse's own lips, as to where he
was on the fatal Sunday. Every word he said, and
we published, was true. The instant Mr. Hicks, of
the firm of W. & H. Hicks, Pine street, saw the
“Herald” yesterday, he went to Mr. <u title="John (elsewhere)">James</u> <u>Connor</u>,
the Type Founder, and reminded him that they had
seen Morse <i>in company with a young lady in black, on
the fatal Sunday, in Broadway, at 3 in the afternoon!</i>
   On that occasion, Mr. <u>Conner</u>, Mr. Hicks, Mr.
<u title="Baker, Backer, Bucker (elsewhere)">Becker</u>, and Mr. M'Kee the ship broker, &c. of
Wall street, were in company. The young lady is
the daughter of highly respectable widow lady,
living in Morton street. She has brothers and sis-
ters. They live on their means. We have her
name, and know her well; but it would be a
great outrage to publish the name. The above
four gentlemen met Morse and the young lady
in Broadway, between White and Walker streets,
on that Sunday, at half past three P. M. They
read the “Herald” separately, and then went to the
Upper Police, and told their story. The Mayor
detained them, and made Mr. M'Kee name the
young lady, and tell her residence. Officer Hilliker
was sent to the house, found her, brought her up to
the Upper Police Office, in tears. She corroborated
all Morse's statements, and when he was brought
out of the cell, she identified him as the man who
was with her from 3 P. M. on that Sunday, till 11 A.
M. on the next day, Monday morning. But we will
give part of her examination:—
   Q.—You can swear that the man here called
Morse, is the man that was with you that Sunday,
the 25th of July?
   Young Lady.—I can. He was the man.
   Q.—Where did you first meet with him that day?
   A.—In Bleecker street, near Morton.
   Q.—What hour?
   A.—The clock struck three as I left my mother's
house in the afternoon.
   Q.—Had you seen him before.
   A.—I had, and agreed to go to Staten Island.
   Q.—Which way did you go?
   A.—Up Bleecker street and down Broadway.
   Q.—Did you meet any body you knew?
   A.—I met Mr. <u>McKee</u> in Broadway.
   Q.—Did you go to Staten Island with Morse?
   A.—I did.
   Q.—What passed there?
   A.—He kept my mind occupied, and my attention
off the time until the last boat started for New
York.
   Q.—What then?
   A.—He persuaded me to stay at the Hotel; and I
did not know what was for the best, and stayed.
   Q.—Did you pass the night in the same room with
him?
   A.—I did.
   Q.—What time did you retire?
   A.—Not till near midnight.
   Q.—Did he take any liberties with you?
   A.—He kissed me and hugged me a good deal,
and he tried to persuade me to yield to his wishes;
but I resisted all night.
   Q.—Did he use any force or violence?
   A.—I can't say that he tried to use force.
   Q.—Did you lay down on the bed?
   A.—I did, for part of the night.
   Q.—Did you undress?
   A.—I did partly.
   Q.—Did you wear any night clothes?
   A.—He went down stairs to get some night clothes
for me.
   Q.—Then you laid down on the bed with him in
the night clothes?
   A.—I did.
   Q.—Did you sleep any?
   A.—I can't say I did.
   Q.—Did he not try to force you?
   A.—He tried to persuade me to consent to his wish-
es in every way; but I refused.
   Q.—He did not violate your person, then?
   A.—He did not.
   Q.—When did you return to the city?
   A.—About ten or eleven next morning.
   Q.—Have you seen him since until to-day?
   A.—I have not.
   This is the substance of this poor girl's testimony;
and she was half deluged in tears the whole time.
She is very beautiful; tall, slim, genteel, and one of
the most modest looking young ladies in the city.
   Thus Morse has proved where he was from 3
P. M., on that fatal Sunday, till 11 A. M. next day.
Mr. John Conroy, the celebrated fishing tackle ma-
ker, of Fulton street, saw him and spoke to him at
10½ A. M., on that fatal Sunday, in Ann street, near
Theatre alley. Morse has now to account for
where he was between half past 10 and half past 2
or 3 o'clock on that Sunday. We are not allowed to
say more to-night.

work about day-break; hoping to get through with
it before her husband or her eldest children would
awake. We give such of the particulars as we can
recollect in her own words:
   “I had it all arranged the evening before; had
sharpened the axe and fixed the meat block which
stands outside the door, and laid the axe beside it;
	...
he jumped out of bed, and seizing me round the
waist, asked me what I was going to do; I told
him that I was going to hang myself; he held on to
me and screamed out for help, until our nearest
neighbors came to his assistance.”

   C<small>ORONER'S</small> O<small>FFICE</small>.—An inquest was held at the cor-
ner of West and Jane streets, on the body of Rebecca
<u>Foshay</u>, aged 27, a native of Belfast, Ireland. It appeared
that the deceased had been very intemperate for the last
year past, and that her death was the consequence of her
addiction to that filthy vice.
   The jury found a verdict of apoplexy, produced by in-
temperance.
   Another inquest was held at No. 3<s title="5 ?">6</s>1 Rivington street,
on the body of <u>Antoine</u> Morgan, a native of <u title="Massachusetts">Massachu-
sets</u>, aged 55, who was accidentally drowned while saw-
ing wood on board a sloop at the foot of <u title="Delancey">Delancy</u> street.
Verdict, accidental death.
   A third inquest was held at No. 42 Ridge street, on the
body of Robert Farrell, a native of this city, aged 11
years, who was drowned while bathing on Wednesday
night, at the foot of Broome street. The deceased was a
good swimmer, but subject to fits, and was seized with a
fit after he had been about ten minutes in the water. Be-
fore assistance could get to the lad from the shore, the
tide carried him under a raft of logs, where he sank.
Verdict, accidentally drowned.
   A fifth inquest was held on the body of the infant child
of Robert Duncan, residing at 110 119th street, which
died in consequence of the administering of a dose of lau-
danum by mistake, the nurse and mother thinking it to
be a dose of <u title="paregoric">paragoric</u>.
   The jury found “that the female infant came to her
death by having laudanum administered in the place of
<u>paragoric</u>, which was sold from the store of S. S. Hin-
man, 145 Eighth Avenue, in a mistake for <u>paragoric</u>, and
the jury conceive there was considerable negligence on
the part of the clerk who sold that same drug.”
   P<small>AUCITY OF</small> B<small>USINESS</small>.—Only one charge at the Lower
Police yesterday, and that was for such an unseasonable
offence, as stealing a feather bed in the dog days. The
guilty one was Ann Thompson, and she was, of course,

   T<small>HE</small> H<small>OBOKEN</small> T<small>RAGEDY</small>.—The investigation
which the Mayor and Justice Taylor are indefati-
gably prosecuting at the upper police office, yes-
terday resulted in the discovery of evidence which
wholly and totally exonerates the prisoner Morse
from any participation in that horrid affair, and
established the truth of his assertion that, on the
afternoon, evening and night, of the fatal Sunday,
25th July, he was at Staten Island, in company
with another female. The witness who establish-
ed this alibi was a young girl, some 16 years of
age, of highly respectable character and connex-
ions, employed in one of the principal type <u title="= foundries">foun-
deries</u> in the vicinity of this office, and residing in
the upper part of the city. A partial acquaintance
had for some time existed between them; and ear-
ly on the afternoon of the fatal day they acciden-
tally met in the street; and Morse accosting her,
succeeded in persuading her to accompany
him on an excursion to Staten Island; and
when there, he managed to detain her until the
last boat had left, and it was impossible to return
to the city that night. He then, by dint of threat-
ening to leave her alone, to hold her name up to
odium, and by every other foul means that he
could invent, fairly compelled her to go to the ho-
tel, and he persuaded her to retire to bed, under
the most solemn promises that she should not re-
ceive any injury at his hands. During the night,
however, he got into her chamber, and used some
force in his endeavors to accomplish his rascally
purpose, in which, however, he was unsuccessful.
In the morning the young girl returned to the city
and went to her home in Morton street, and pro-
bably for fear of the consequences to herself,
would never have appeared at all, had the urgent
necessity of the case not demanded her attend-
ance.
   Morse is thus, happily for himself, relieved from
the odium and responsibility of the murder of
which he has been unjustly suspected; but has he
not, by his rascally treatment of this young girl,
subjected himself to a criminal prosecution of an-
other, and scarcely less diabolical character?—
What say you, Mr. Whiting?
   The allusion made to a barber in Ann street in
our paper of yesterday, as has having been spo-
ken to by Morse to accompany him to Hoboken,
was made on the strength of publications in oth-
er papers, which are evidently incorrect, as the
gentleman in Ann street has no acquaintance with
Morse. The person intended is, as we understand,
a barber in another street, and not the one in Ann
street.

seem, that the man arrested at Worcester, and against
whom such apparently strong <u title="circumstantial">circumstancial</u> testi-
mony was produced—as the probable murderer of
the ill-fated Mary Rogers was not at Hoboken with
her on Sunday. He has clearly proved an <i>alibi</i>, by
the testimony of a young girl with whom he went to
Staten Island that day, and remained until Monday—
as also by the evidence of the landlord in whose house
they lodged.
   Thus, then, the mystery of the murder deepens.
   Meantime, will not the decent press take a hint
from the false scent upon which, in this case, they
have opened, with such wide-mouthed and cruel
alacrity?
   Will they not see that common fairness and jus-
tice, require that names and pretended circumstances
of character, and alleged antecedent misconduct,
should not be trumpeted forth against a man arrested
only on suspicion, and who may, as in this case, be
wholly guiltless of the crime imputed.

and also in the examination of Morse himself. In
some of his answers the previous day, as we are un-
officially informed, Morse stated that he was not at
Hoboken on Sunday the 25th July, and did not see
Miss Rogers that day, but that he was at Staten Isl-
and in company with a young lady of Morton street,
with whom he staid there on Sunday night, both
lodging in the same room, in different beds, &c.
To test the truth of this statement, the Mayor on
Wednesday afternoon proceeded to Staten Island,
and was informed at one of the hotels there, that a
man answering the description of Morse had staid
there all night of the 25th July, having a young lady
with him, both lodging in the same room. In ad-
dition to this, Morse having been induced in his
private examination to give the name of the young
lady in Morton street, the Mayor and Justice sought
for, found and brought her to the office, where, as
we understand, she deposed that she had seen Morse
once before—that he met her on Sunday, 25th July,
early in the afternoon, in Bleecker street, and per-
suaded her to accompany him on a pleasure excur-
sion to Staten Island, and that she went there;
and that under one pretext or another he continued
to detain her there until after the last boat
had gone, when he urged her to lodge with
him, which she refused, but that on his threaten-
ing to expose her and his promise not to mo-
lest her, she was induced at length to lodge in the
same room with him, in different beds—That du-
ring the night he approached her bed, and com-
menced taking improper liberties with her, which
she resisted, and that he then resorted to force to
effect his purpose, but that she successfully repel-
led all his efforts—That the next forenoon they left
the island, he accompanying her to this city, and
as far up Greenwich street as the corner of Barc-
lay street, where they separated, and she returned
to her home.
   In corroboration in part of this statement,
Messrs. <u title="John (elsewhere)">James</u> Conner, William H. Hicks, R. <u title="Backer, Becker, Bucker (elsewhere)">Ba-
ker</u>, and W. J. McKee, were severally examined,
and unitedly deposed, that they met Morse and a
young lady on Sunday, the 25th July, between 1
and 2 o'clock in the afternoon, in Broadway, pro-
ceeding downwards towards the Battery; and that
on seeing him, one of them remarked to the other,
“there goes Morse with your girl.” An alibi hav-
ing thus been proved—the evidence is almost ir-
resistible, that Morse, whatever may be his vices, is
guiltless at least, of the murder of Miss Rogers.—
He is, however, continued in prison, on other char-
ges, viz.:—those of assault and battery on and aban-
doning his wife, are yet unanswered—and rumor
says that a third charge is, or will be made against
him, of the nature of which we are not officially
able to speak. Who the murderer is, heaven, and
the guilty perpetrators only know.—<i>Express</i>.

   T<small>HE</small> C<small>ASE OF</small> M<small>ISS</small> R<small>OGERS AND</small> M<small>ORSE</small>.—As J. W.
Morse, who was arrested on suspicion of being the murderer
of Miss Mary C. Rogers, by proving an <i>alibi</i> has exonerated
himself from that horrid charge, and is now in custody only
to answer a charge of assault and battery on and abuse of his
wife until he can furnish bail in $500 for his appearance for
trial, it may not be improper to state the reason he assigns
for having fled from the city, and remained absent until
brought back hither on the suspicion of being a murderer.—
He states, we are informed, that he was not acquainted with
Miss Rogers, and firmly believed that the young lady with
whom he went to and staid all night at Staten Island
was no other than Miss Mary C. Rogers herself; that after
hearing of her death and the discovery of her dead body, he
thought she had destroyed herself on account of the treatment
she had experienced from him, and that he therefore fled for
fear of being brought into difficulty on her account; that he
did not discover his mistake until last Thursday morning,
when the young lady with whom he was at Staten Island was
brought to the Police Office and proved to be <i>not</i> Miss
Rogers, but the identical female he had endeavored to seduce
into a dishonorable connection at Staten Island.
   Whether this is the reason of his hegira to the East, or a
mere fiction of his own, we leave to others to determine.

		POLICE—Friday.
   The testimony in the case of Mary C. Rogers, was
brought to a close yesterday, as far as J. W. Morse
was concerned, and the result was, that he has been
discharged from the complaint of having participated
in the outrage upon this unfortunate female. He was
examined yesterday, and corroborated in the most
minute particulars, the statement of the young girl,
which we gave yesterday, but he alleges that he used
no force, but that he did endeavor by persuasion and
arguments to induce her to consent to his wishes,
in which he was unsuccessful.

   Perhaps not the least extraordinary part of this
case, is the fact, that up to Thursday morning, Morse
was laboring under the conviction that Mary C. Ro-
gers was the girl who was with him at Staten Island,
and he yesterday told the Magistrate, that he thought
up to that time, that they had been deceiving him as
to the dress of Mary Rogers. He added, that when
he was told of the body having been found, he felt
sure that it must have been that of the girl whom he
had so shamefully maltreated, and who he suspected
had committed suicide on account of his conduct to
her.
   He adds that he left the city on account of the
trouble with his wife, and his affair with the young
woman, fearing that in the latter case, she might dis-
cover who he was and bring him to punishment.—
He does not up to this hour know the name of that
young woman. In this case the matter would more
properly be the subject of a civil action, as there is
not sufficient evidence to warrant a criminal prose-
cution. The only complaint against him now is that
of his wife for the assault upon her, in which case he
is required to give bonds in $500, in default of which
he remains in prison.
   We can not conclude the mention of this affair,
without awarding to the Mayor, Justice Taylor and
Officer Hilliker the credit which they have deserved
for the promptness and perseverance in tracing and
following up a person, against whom such a mass of
testimony and apparently so conclusive had been
produced. We trust they will not cease their efforts
on account of their disappointment.

<b>The Murder of Mary Rogers—Examination
			of Morse.</b>
   Mr. Morse was examined yesterday, separately
from the young lady who was with him at Staten
Island, and he fully confirmed all her statements to
the most minute particular. The magistrates will
not allow his examination to be made public on the
young lady's account. Suffice it to say that the
Mayor, the District Attorney, and Justice Taylor
have given their full attention to this matter, and
have acquitted and released him of all criminal
charge in relation to Mary Rogers, or the Morton
street young lady. He never knew Mary Rogers—
he never used tobacco in any shape, and never was
at Anderson's. If the Morton street young lady
proceeds against him, her only remedy is a civil suit.
She swears he used no force.
   In justice to her, we are bound to say, that after
the steamboat left Staten Island, she tried to get
some one to bring her over in a small boat, but could
not. She then consented to go to the village hotel,
above the quarantine landing, only because Morse
solemnly promised her that she should have a sepa-
rate room, and a female of the house to sleep with
her. He did not get the female. He brought her
night clothes. She put a chair against the door, and
her parasol or umbrella, and when she took off her
clothes and laid down, she took the precaution to
wrap the sheet around her. But he came into the
room, and came to bed, but used no violence—only
persuasion. As soon as she could, she got up—
threatened to cry “murder”—he desisted, and she
sat by the window, half dressed, till daylight.
   Morse is now held only till he gets bail on the
charge of his wife.
   The Lower Police have arrested a negro, said to
know something about the murder of Mary Rogers
by a gang of negroes, and he is now in jail.

   The principal event, and the most important to the
lovers of the ballet, is the arrival of Fanny Elssler from
her tour to Trenton Falls, Lake George, and parts adja-
cent. Such was the enthusiastic delight with which
the divine Fanny viewed the Falls of Trenton, that it
was with great difficulty she could be prevailed upon to
leave that romantic vicinity for the dull routine of the
Atlantic seaboard. She is under an engagement to ap-

little financial difficulty to be got over before the Phila-
delphians can be gratified, to wit, the payment of, or se-
curity for some $2000, said to be in arrears up to this

		<i>From the National Gazette.</i>
	<b>MURDER OF MISS ROGERS.</b>
   This case continues, as in justice it should, to ex-
<s>cit</s>e deep interest. The latest account of the un-
fortunate girl is in the following evidence given be-
fore Justice Parker day before yesterday. We co-
<s>py</s> from the Journal of Commerce.
   “C<small>ASE OF</small> M<small>ARY</small> C. R<small>OGERS</small>.—Daniel C. Payne,
of No. 47 John street, cork cutter, went yesterday
	...
my brother was coming off the Battery with his
children, to whom I spoke for a moment or <u title="so (in Evening Post)">two</u> and
then parted. I walked up Broadway, and when near
Ann street, noticed a storm was fast coming
up, and thinking it was too early to go to bed, I
walked up to Bickford's, in James street, and re-
mained there until nine o'clock, and then went
home and retired for the night. I was under the
<d>[Col.2]</d>
impression that the <u title="omnibuses">omnibusses</u> run on Sundays,
	...
in the morning when I arose. Mr. Crommelin al-
so informed us that the inquest had been held the
night before, which did away with the necessity
for myself or the family going to Hoboken.

   We are very much surprised to note that this
testimony is passed over by several New York
journals with the opinion that nothing important
was elicited from the witness. Now it appears to
us that very grave questions arise upon sifting the
statements of Mr. Payne, involving nothing less
than a suspicion that he has not told a perfectly rea-
sonable story. Cautiously as such a suspicion
should be mentioned, it is nevertheless right to ut-
ter it upon proper grounds. These are presented
by the New <u title="York">york</u> Star, in which we find the an-
nexed comments upon Mr. Payne's testimony.
   “Narration of Mr. Payne before the police offi-
cers, contains statements and admissions which
should lead to further scrutiny and examination.
He says <i>they were engaged to be married</i>, and he
<d>[Col.3]</d>
was a boarder in the house of her mother, where
she also had resided up to the moment she left the
house on the morning of her mysterious disappear-
ance and destruction. <i>He is the last person</i> who
saw her there on that fatal day. He says, “<i>she
came up stairs and knocked at my door</i>.” He
opened it, and found her dressed for a walk.
She said she was going to see Mrs. Downing.
He said very well, he would “<i>come for her in the
evening</i>.” The statement in an another paper is
that, he said “Very well, Mary, I will look out for
you in the evening.” If either be correct, here is
a positive engagement to meet her to whom he was
affianced, and which was not likely to be broken
under such circumstances without any reasonable
cause.
   He says that “from 11 o'clock, A. M. until 1, P.
M. he was at his brother's, or went with him to the
Dey st. Bazaar. He then walked up Broadway,
and thence to Bickford's, in James street, until 2 o'-
clock—<i>then went to Fulton street</i> and dined at
an eating house; went home about 3, and laid
down until six, P. M., when he walked to the Bat-
tery.”
   The question may be here asked: Why did he
pass his own boarding house (kept by Mary's mo-
ther) to dine at an eating house, in Fulton street,
but a block from her own residence? And again,
an important question may be suggested: From 3
to 6, when he alleges he was at the house, was he
seen by the mother or any of the family? Or was
he there without his usual intercourse with them—
for it must have been about their usual tea time.
   At 6, he says he walked to the Battery, and re-
turning, on reaching Ann street, (which is but a
few doors from his boarding house,) he saw the
storm gathering, and walked to Bickford's in James
street (a distance, perhaps, over half a mile,) and
staid there until 9 o'clock and returned and retired
for the night.
   The two hours of this awful thunder storm are
important, and his whereabouts should be most sat-
isfactorily ascertained, and so should every hour of
that melancholy day. <i>He knew where she had
gone</i>, of which <i>even her mother was ignorant</i>.
   He had promised to meet her in the evening;
he went to the Battery at the very time he should
have taken the contrary direction to fulfil his en-
gagement with her who had confided herself to him,
and at Ann street he turns off for Bickford's, when
in the same space of time he could have nearly
reached her, and thus shown a reasonable solici-
tude for her.
   In the searches he made for her, it <i>does not ap-
pear</i> that he held any <i>consultations</i> with her <i>mo-
ther or friends</i>, as to the places they might deem
proper to be searched.
   After searching for her at Harlem, Williamsburg
and Hoboken, without success, he was afterwards
“informed by Mr. Luther, of No. 90 Chambers
street that <i>Mary had been found at Hoboken,
and an inquest was to be held</i>,” but <small>HE DID NOT GO
TO</small> H<small>OBOKEN OR ATTEND THE INQUEST</small>. A Mr.
Crommelin went. And can it be that he was so
lost to all feelings of humanity—of affection for
her who was his betrothed—of a regard for the afflic-
tions of her aged, widowed mother—that he could
remain, and not rush to the spot and call down the
vengeance of Heaven upon the seducer and mur-
derer. It requires more explanation than has yet
been given.
   Is there not in the above suggestions sufficient
ground for examining this witness again and call-
ing upon him to substantiate his statements? His
conduct, according to his account was to say the
least very extraordinary from first to last, and re-
quires explanation.

   <i>Arrest of <u>Moore</u>, the supposed murderer,
of Miss Rogers</i>.—The steamer Worcester
arrived this morning, brought lo the city the
above named person. He was arrested at
West Boylston, about seven miles north of
Worcester, on <u title="Sunday">sunday</u>. He had been hover-
ing about Worcester ever since he left this
city, and was watched pretty closely by the
authorities at that place. He was taken into
custody as he was in the act of <u title="receiving">receiveing</u> a
letter—which was immediately opened and
found to have been written in New York—
advising him to shave off his whiskers, and
disguise himself as much as possible, as the
police were on the look-out for him.
   We understand that he is the person seen
in conversation with Miss Rogers, at Hobo-
ken, toward evening of Sunday the 25th
ultimo. He was then seen and recognized by
a gentleman of this city, whose name we
have, but do not think it requisite to mention;

this gentleman made inquiry and <u title="ascertained">ascetained</u>

expected a letter; the letter was watched for
and obtained, and it bore no date or place

   M<small>URDER OF</small> M<small>ISS</small> R<small>OGERS</small>.—Morse was yester-
day discharged from the accusation against him for
the murder of Miss Rogers, it having been fully es-
tablished that he was not at Hoboken on that Sun-
day. Among the circumstances not hitherto ad-
verted to, which tended to support the supposition
that Morse was that day at Hoboken, was the fact
that Morse owns a small property in the neighbor-
hood of the spot where it was supposed he was
seen with Miss Rogers, to which property he was
in the habit of making constant visits.
   So much for circumstantial evidence: which,
however strong and apparently incontrovertible as
it was in this case, is a dangerous sort of proof on
which to destroy men's characters or lives. It now
turns out, if Morse's statement can be relied on,
that he never had any acquaintance with Miss Ro-
gers, nor could he identify her from any other fe-
male in the city. Nor did he know the name of
the girl, as he has all along alleged, who so impru-
dently accompanied him to Staten Island. And
when he heard of the body of Miss Rogers having
been found in the river, he supposed that it was
Miss Rogers who had accompanied him to Staten
Island, and who felt so degraded by remaining with
him all night, that she had in consequence commit-
ted suicide by drowning herself.
   This supposition on his part shows that he must
have a tolerably correct appreciation of the feelings
of a virtuous female, in consequence of having so
indiscreetly subjected herself to insult and loss of
character; for the young lady who did accompany
him, has been so deeply affected by the occurrence,
and the consequent ordeal she was obliged to go
through at the Police Office, in being most minutely
examined as to everything which occurred between
her and Morse, that she yesterday morning pro-
cured laudanum to destroy herself, and only for an
<u title="accidental (Schenectady-Reflector-1841-08-27)">accident</u> and timely discovery of her intentions by
her family, she would probably have <u title="been at this time another victim (Schenectady-Reflector-1841-08-27)">succeeded in
her purpose</u>.
   Morse, although discharged from the complaint
against him for the murder of Miss Rogers, is still
detained in prison until he can procure unquestion-
able bail in the sum of $1000, to answer the com-
plaint of maltreating his wife.
   The Mayor and Police having been thus foiled in
their first attempt to discover the murderers, are,
if possible, exerting themselves with greater energy
to bring the authors of this horrid tragedy to light;
and the Mayor and Justice Taylor have devoted the
greater part of yesterday to his business alone.—

   M<small>ISS</small> R<small>OGERS</small>.—Nothing new, has been brought to
light, connected with the murder of this unfortunate
young lady. By the last advices, a man by the name
of Morse had been arrested, who had left the city, un-
der singular circumstances, the day after the murder.
Among the thousand rumors and stories of the day, it
is said that Morse was seen in her company on the day
of her disappearance. Morse is a married man, and
the probabilities are stronger for than against him. It
is very strange that the authorities do not offer a suit-
able reward, for the discovery of the perpetrator. The
Mayor of New York, and the Gov. of the State, are
both behind their duty in this respect.

   T<small>HE</small> M<small>ARY</small> R<small>OGERS</small> M<small>YSTERY</small>.—There have been
no further developments respecting this melancholy
tragedy, and if any individual has been arrested, his
name and all particulars in relation to him—or of
the grounds for his arrest—have been carefully veiled
from the eye of the press. The Mayor and Justice
Taylor, are said to be disappointed (!) at their not
being able to fix the guilt on Morse, that they have
determined to keep all further proceedings strictly
private. If they arrest any one on suspicion, they
will not disclose his name, nor let any one connected
with the press know what are the suspicious grounds
therefore, or the circumstantial or other testimony in
existence against him. Now this is all wrong. First,
the public have a right to know what is done by the
magistracy; and, secondly, because the publication
of the suspicious facts leads either to their confirma-
tion or refutation. As a proof of this theory, we in-
stance the case of Morse, who would at this time
stand probably committed for trial, but for the con-
travention of the magisterial edict.
   On Saturday morning, Morse was bailed by
Adams, the wood engraver, and Redfield, the stereo-
typer, in the sum of $<s title="3 ?">5</s>00 each; but by some strange
hocus pocus or other, a writ of habeas corpus was
subsequently sued out, and all the parties taken be-
fore Judge Lynch, who not only dismissed Morse,
but released his sureties. Police Justices Taylor
and Palmer were very wrathy, and also indignant,
when they heard of this procedure, and intend to
direct the District Attorney to prosecute the bail.
This course may be very proper, but it strikes us as
beginning at the wrong end, for either the order of
his Honor Judge Lynch, is legal or not. If legal,
the District Attorney will only have to show his teeth
without biting; and if it is illegal, then in would be
better to set the District Attorney to prosecute Judge
Lynch for his presumption in interfering with the
orders and decrees of the Police Magistrates. As
to prosecuting—<u title="query (16-19 centuries)">quere</u>, persecuting the bail, that's a
small business for Mr. District Attorney, and we hope
his Honor the Mayor will put his veto thereon.
   Since the above was written, we have been in-
formed, on good authority, that Mrs. Morse herself
went with the bail, before Judge Lynch, and agreed
to withdraw the complaint against Morse, a recon-
ciliation having been brought about by the inter-
vention of mutual friends. Morse is to keep clear
of Staten Island, and of young ladies in black espe-
cially, for the future. Thus ends that nine days'
wonder.

   <i>Police.—Saturday and Sunday</i>.—On Saturday
morning Joseph W. Morse having procured the re-
quisite bail for his appearance to answer the
charge of assaulting his wife, was discharged
from custody. In the afternoon he was brought be-
fore Judge Lynch on a <i>habeas corpus</i> sued out by W.
J. Haskett, Esq. his counsel, who produced before
the Judge a full satisfaction piece from Mrs. Morse,
whereupon his bail was released and he was dischar-
ged from the complaint, and the husband and wife
left the office together in the most affectionate man-
ner.
   How this consummation was effected is of course
known only to the parties most interested, but cer-
tainly very cogent arguments must have been used
with Mrs. Morse, to effect so sudden a change of
purpose, for the reporter was yesterday informed
that on Saturday morning Mrs. M. called at the of-
fice of an eminent lawyer of this city and advised
with him as to the necessary preliminaries to pro-
cure a decree of divorce from him, and she was to
call again the same afternoon at 2 o'clock. She did
not call, and soon after that hour, the legal gentle-
man had the satisfaction of seeing the husband and
wife walking home arm in arm.
   The lesson which he has received will doubtless
be of more service to him than a hundred curtain
lectures. No other arrests have been made in this
case.

   On Saturday night, about a quarter past 11 o'clock,
watchman Wm. H. Douglass, perceived a man,
named John Griffin, a cabinet maker by trade, shut-
ting up his shop in Elm, one door from Canal street.
Griffin first nailed a board across the window and
locked the door, after which he departed. The watch-
man then perceived a light in the shop, but thought
nothing was wrong, and he went on his round. Re-
turning that way in about fifteen or twenty minutes,
he perceived that the light in Griffin's shop had in-
creased, and he went up and tore off the board which
had been nailed up by Griffin. On looking in at the
window he then perceived that the premises were on
fire, whereupon he immediately gave the alarm, and
ran off to the Watch House for assistance, and by
the time he got back to the shop, the fire had been ex-
tinguished. Griffin was among the first that came to
the spot, when the alarm was raised, and he was
promptly arrested, on a charge of having fired the
premises. In extenuation of this, it may be mention-
ed, that Griffin who had all his stock and tools in the
shop, was not insured for one cent, neither was the
shop insured by the owner. It certainly looks very
suspicious against Griffin, the more so from the fact,
that when an entrance had been effected into the shop,
the shavings and rubbish were found gathered into a
heap in the centre of the shop, and were on fire. He
is at present committed for further examination.
	...
   On Saturday night, officers Colvin and Watts as-
sisted by some watchmen, and armed with a war-
rant from Justice <u>Stephens</u>, proceeded to a low den
in Anthony street, kept by a wench named Jane
Prince, where they found 27 human beings of the
very lowest and most degraded class, (among them
two white men) huddled together like pigs. The
whole posse was brought to the Watch House, and
in the morning they were disposed of in the most
summary manner, some being sent up to pick Oak-
um, as vagrants, others remanded to be tried, and the
head negress was committed for trial for keeping a
disorderly house. A few such operations as the
above would be of infinite service to that distinguish-
ed portion of the city.

   J<small>OSEPH</small> W. M<small>ORSE FULLY DISCHARGED</small>.—Morse
was brought on Saturday, on a habeas corpus,
by his counsel, W. Jay Haskett, Esq., before
Judge Lynch, at his chambers, and fully dischar-
ged from the custody of the law. There is now
but one opinion in relation to his innocence; and
all the circumstances surrounding him at the time
have been clearly explained, and leave him be-
yond suspicion in this melancholy affair. It
was at first supposed that his narration of the Sta-
ten Island affair, and its corroboration by the
young lady, was but an artful device of his wily
counsel to prove an alibi, but this proof was posi-
tively confirmed by the personal examination of
the inmates of the house on the Island, by the
Mayor himself.
   On the hearing before the Judge, Mr. Haskett
read to his honors full satisfaction piece, signed
by the wife, who, despite her wrongs, clung to
her husband with the ardor of woman's love.—
They left in company together perfectly recon-
ciled, and went home. Mrs. Morse is a fine look-
ing woman, and her conduct towards her husband,
during his imprisonment, reflects credit upon her
heart. After this providential chastisement for
his infidelity, we trust that he may become sensi-
ble of the past, and make proper reparation for his
follies. He bears the reputation of a man of in-
dustrious habits, and stands at the very head of
his profession as an artist, and we leave him with
those kind words which our Savior spoke to fal-
len man—“Go, and sin no more.”

<d>[Col.7]</d>
<m9>   ☞ AT a meeting of North River Fire Engine Co. No.
27, held on Monday evening, 16th inst., the following extract
from an article in the Sunday Mercury, in relation to the
late murder of Mary C. Rogers was read to the Company:
   “With regard to the carrying away of a young female by
a boat's crew, the circumstances are thus explained by the
girl herself, in the form of an affidavit, made at the police
office. In the boat that boarded the one in which she was,
were seven young men, averaging about seventeen years of
age, who beat her companions, and forcibly took her from
the boat, landed her at Hoboken, and then took her into the
woods, where she was treated with the most brutal violence.
After the young ruffians had glutted their beastly appetites,
the poor girl was carried back to the boat, and at a late
hour in the evening landed in this city. On their braces, or
on some part of their bodies were the figures 27, signifying
that they were members of, or in some way attached to the
fire company of that number. Every person who ventures
abroad with a female, owes it to himself and to her to be
well armed. We have no preventive police, and no guardi-
ans of the peace at all<u title=".”">.</u>
   Whereupon, the following preamble and resolution were
adopted.<u>”</u>
   Whereas, the above article contains an imputation against
the members of this Company which if true, would involve
them in a transaction of the blackest infamy and disgrace—
and whereas, as good citizens, it is our duty to investigate
the circumstances which led to the imputation, and endeav-
or if possible to ferret out the villains who perpetrated this
foul act, under the insignia of our Company, and bring them
to justice. Therefore
   Resolved, That a committee of three be appointed to ex-
amine into, and investigate to the fullest extent the imputa-
tion contained in the said extract, and to spare no pains to
bring to justice the offenders, who have so wantonly com-
mitted the double outrage of villainy to an innocent female,
and to this company.
   At a subsequent meeting, held on Friday evening, the
above committee reported—
   That they had faithfully examined into the subject upon
which they were appointed, with a full estimate of its im-
portance, as well to the character of this company as to
the cause of public justice.
   That after a strict investigation amongst all the “volun-
teers,” who are in the habit of running with the Company,
as well as amongst the members, (none of the latter, how-
ever, being under 21 years of age, and therefore not an-
swerable to the imputation,) your committee have to a sat-
isfaction to report, that they are all innocent of the charge.
   During the course of the investigation your committee
have found that many persons in the vicinity of Clinton
market, totally unconnected with this company, either as
members or volunteers, or otherwise, are for causes un-
known to us, in the habit of wearing belts with the number
“27” on them, around their bodies, but it was not in the
power of this committee to ascertain who they are.
   Your committee would therefore recommend for adop-
tion the following resolution—
   Resolved, That this company, from its well known char-
acter for integrity and morality, after the investigation thus
had, appeal with confidence to the justice and magnanimity
of a generous public, to clear its members and volunteers
from any knowledge of, or participation in this horrible out-
rage.
   It was also resolved that these proceedings be published.

   T<small>HE</small> M<small>URDER OF</small> M<small>ISS</small> R<small>OGERS</small>.—The murder of this un-
fortunate young lady is still wrapped in mystery as to the
time when, the place where, and the circumstances under
which the bloody deed was done; and although suspicions
were permitted to settle on some individuals, and arrests
made and examinations instituted, with a view to fix the foul
offence on the guilty author, yet the murderer still remains
concealed from the eye of man, and <u title="Souls of deceased loved ones (Wikipedia)">the manes</u> of the mur-
dered girl remain unappeased—her blood unatoned. The
efforts of the Police, which have been unremitted, have been
continually misdirected. The persons suspected have, with-
out exception, been acquitted of the suspicions entertained
against them; and no one has been found who saw the young
lady after she left her mother's residence on the fatal day,
notwithstanding the searching inquiries that have been made.
Speculative opinions have been advanced by some that the
girl has not been murdered; that the body found was not suf-
ficiently identified as hers; and that her sudden disappearance
is owing to some other cause than death. The proof of her
identity, however, particularly by means of her clothes, is
sufficiently established in the minds of the municipal and
Police authorities, to dissipate the seemingly delusive hope
of her surviving. And although incredulity may still disbe-
lieve, and fancy conceive that she is not numbered with the
dead, yet the evidence is satisfactory to our mind that she
has been brutally murdered; and that time, the revealer of
secrets, will yet bring the authors of the horrid deed to light.
   A foolish story was yesterday started that she had returned
to her home and friends; but no one could tell how or whence
the rumor came abroad, and it was almost universally be-
lieved to be a hoax, or some device of an enemy to put the
authorities off their guard.

			POLICE.
   <i>The case of Mary C. Rogers</i>.—Nothing new has
transpired to elicit light upon this mysterious case.
No new arrests have been made, nor any persons
that the Reporter could learn, suspected. The
opinion that Miss Rogers met her fate on this side of
the river, gains ground rapidly, and the general im-
pression seems to be, that she did not get many
blocks from her mother's house.
   Whatever may be the truth of the case, time alone
can discover, and meanwhile we trust that our au-
thorities will not relax their vigilance.
   Since writing the above, Mr. Crommelin has call-
ed upon us, and requested us to make known his
dissent from a very long and labored article of two
columns, which appeared in the Tattler penny paper,
urging the strong probability that Miss Rogers is still
alive, and that the body found at Hoboken was not
that of the unfortunate girl. Upon this point we
have heard but one opinion, and however strange
may have seemed the conduct of her relations, and of
Mr. Payne, her betrothed, we are entirely convinced
that the body was sufficiently identified. After being
disinterred and brought to this city, the clothes were
submitted to the mother, aunt, and an intimate friend
of the hapless girl, and all at once recognized them;
the mother even pointing out some particular repairs
done on the Saturday previous to her leaving home.
   We should not have noticed this affair at all, were
it not that the ardour of the Police authorities might
be damped, were they become convinced that they
were pursuing a shadow. No doubt whatever rests
on our mind, that Miss Rogers was murdered, and
we are compelled to fear, that the mystery now
shrouding her fate, will remain long undiscovered.
   At the Police yesterday, not one single case occur-
red worth noting; there was not even a petty larceny
to disturb the <i title="leisure, peace">otium</i> of the officers.

   <i>Coroner's Office</i>.—The Coroner, on Saturday, held
an inquest on the body of Wm. Hope, one of the
crew of the U. S. Steamer Fulton. On Friday night
while the Gig (to which boat, Hope belonged) was
lying at Coenties slip, his hat fell overboard, and he
stooped down on the string piece of the wharf to
reach it. While in this position, he lost his balance,
fell overboard, and being unable to swim, was drown-
ed—Verdict, accidental drowning.

   Also, upon the body of an unknown woman found
in the North River at the foot of Robinson street.—
Deceased was about 35 years of age, had on a dark
calico frock, but neither hat, shoes or stockings. In
one ear was an ear-ring, in the other a piece of string.
Verdict, found drowned.

Also—The Coroner yesterday held an inquest
on the body of James Rourke aged 18, who
fell in the East River on Saturday night at the foot
of Clinton street, about 10 o'clock. Some persons
on board the sloop Alfred, were aroused by cries of
some person in the water shouting for help, but be-
fore assistance could be rendered, the unfortunate
man sunk to rise no more. Verdict, <u title="accidentally">accidently</u>
drowned.

   Also, upon the body of William Cooper, lying at
the City Hospital. The deceased fell into the East
River on the 21st inst., at the foot of <u title="Catherine">Cathrine</u> street,
while in a state of intoxication and was got out after
being nearly drowned. He was taken to the city
Hospital, where he died yesterday from congestion
of the brain produced by his ducking and intemper-
ance combined. Verdict accordingly.

		<f15>Farther Particulars,</f15>
	<i>Concerning the Murder of Miss Rogers.</i>
   We have just space enough for a condensed statement
of some new and important developments in this horrid
transaction. The authorities have without doubt, now got
upon the right track. Joseph W. Morse, the individual
who was seen in her company (and <i>quarrelling with her</i>) at
Hoboken, and who immediately fled the city, was arrested
at Holden, Mass. and brought back for examination. Let-
ters addressed to him from N. Y. were intercepted, con-
taining information that he was suspected, cautioning him
to shave off his whiskers and otherwise disguise himself.—
Daniel <u>Paine</u>, to whom the murdered girl was to have
been married, is supposed to be the writer of the letters,
and suspicions have been entertained against him ever
since he made his affidavit before the Court. His whole
conduct appears to have been singularly indifferent and
unlover-like. While the mysterious absence of the girl
was creating the greatest alarm among her friends, he cool-
ly went about his usual business; and when news was
brought him that her body had been found in the water
near the Hoboken shore, he did not even go there, but kept
on about his business!
   We do not see it stated that <u>Paine</u> is under arrest, but
most likely is. Morse in undergoing a secret examination
before the Upper Police Court.
   It is altogether the most horrible instance of brutality
on record. The physician who made a post mortem ex-
amination of the body states that it bore unerring evidence
of having been barbarously violated by more than three or
four different men in succession. Discolorations were
found about the mouth, neck, wrists, &c. as though she
had been bound and gagged.—portions of the under dress
were torn away, probably to make bands and gags of. A
cord was accidentally <u title="discovered">discovored</u> tied tightly around the
neck and entirely imbedded in the <u title="flesh">flesd</u>, and the supposi-
tion is, that towards the last of the tragedy the sufferer
fainted and in that condition the cord was tied to prevent
return of consciousness, and that when dead, the body was
thrown into the water.
   Morse, just before leaving the city, had a quarrel with
his wife, which he probably brought about to furnish him
with an excuse for so abruptly absconding, if he should
afterwards need one. When apprehended he inquired,
“what is this arrest for?”—and was answered, “for abusing
your wife.”—“O, is that all?” said Morse, apparently feel-
ing much relieved by the intelligence.

	THE MURDER OF MISS ROGERS!
   Arrest of the person who most probably com-
mitted the hellish deed.
   Officer Hilliker, attached to our Upper Police,
yesterday arrived in this city by one of the Eas-
tern boats, having in charge a young man, named
Joseph W. Morse, a wood engraver at 120 Nas-
sau street, whom he arrested at Worcester, in
the State of Massachusetts, on suspicion of hav-
ing murdered this unfortunate girl. The circum-
stances affecting the guilt of the accused are
substantially as follows:—Morse, is a married
man, and for some time past has lived on terms
of any thing but that which should exist between
man and wife, consequently creating a natural
feeling in the breast of the partner<u> </u>his bosom,
strongly tending to excite suspicion of his infi-
delity. On the night of the murder he went to
his home, having been out all day, and from the
lateness of the hour was accosted by his wife in
terms of reproach on account of his neglect,
when an altercation ensued, and he <u title="arose">arrose</u> from
the bed with the intention of leaving her. With
all that inherent feeling natural to woman, she
expostulated with him for his rashness in quit-
ting at that unseasonable hour of night his
home and bed. Morse, losing all the attributes
belonging to a man, struck her a violent blow,
which prostrated her to the ground and fled the
house. As he did not return on the following
day, the wife instituted a process against him
for an assault and battery, and a warrant was
consequently issued, but Morse was no where
to be found, and as his manner of leaving the ci-
ty was attended with strong indications of some-
thing more than ordinary in matters where man
and wife are concerned in a mere family broil,
officer Hilliker was dispatched in search of him,
and found him at Worcester, in Massachusetts.
At the Post Office of which place the officer in-
tercepted a letter to Morse, in which a person,
whose name we could not learn, but as we have
reason to believe, has had something to do with
this foul transaction, recommended him to shave
off his whiskers, in order to disguise himself, as
he feared that he would be recognized as being
the perpetrator of this deed. When arrested,
he seemed to be much confused, and was anx-
ious to <u title="ascertain">acertain</u> what was the nature of the com-
plaint against him, and being told that it was
on the warrant of assault and battery committed
on his wife, seemed incredulous, and more than
once demanded of the officer to tell him if some-
thing of a graver nature was not his mission
with him. A ring was taken from his finger,
which was doubtless made for a female hand;
and, it is said, that there is proof indisputable
that he was in company with the unfortunate
Mary Rogers on the evening she was murdered.
   The Mayor (R. H. Morris, Esq.) was active
during the whole of yesterday in investigating
this matter, but deferred the examination of the
accused till this day, and therefore all the partic-
ulars that could possibly be collected are given.
Our next will probably enlighten our readers on

   <i>The Murderer of Miss M. C. Rogers arrest-
ed!</i>—The person who has for some days been
strongly suspected of the murder of Miss Mary
C. Rogers at Hoboken on Sunday, July 25th,
was yesterday <i>arrested</i> by a Police Officer at
Worcester, Mass., and is now safely lodged in
this City for examination.
   He is a Mechanic of this City, named Morse,
a married man, who is identified as the man seen
with Miss Rogers at Hoboken, on the fatal Sun-
day, near dark. He was not at home the follow-
ing night, and soon after left secretly, without in-
forming his family. He was traced out by a note
he sent to an apprentice, directing him to address
him at Worcester, but inform nobody of his where-
abouts. The boy was suspected, examined, and
made to confess.—<i>N. Y. Tribune</i>.

	<b>THE MURDER OF MISS ROGERS.</b>
   The trace which it was expected would lead to
the detection of the murderers of this young woman,
is now broken, and pursuit is as much at fault as
ever. This should not discourage effort, for, to as-
certain error in the direct road to truth. Vigilance,
we trust, will never tire until the measureless vil-
lains who did this deed, have atoned for it with their
lives. There is proof which leaves no room for
doubt, that several ruffians were engaged in the hor-
rible tragedy. If the matter is followed up, it is
impossible that the secret will not escape from some
one of them. They have made the number of cir-
cumstances connected with their guilt as small as
possible; yet such a deed cannot be done without
being linked with many circumstances which reach
into the day-light.
   We are persuaded that pursuit has hitherto been
on a false scent, so far as it has been directed to Ho-
boken. It is impossible that a person so well known
to thousands as this young woman was, should have
passed three blocks without some one having seen
her; and any one who saw her would have remem-
bered it, for she interested all who knew her. It
was when the streets were full of people that she
went out. See how soon the girl who accompanied
Morse to Staten Island was recognized, and how ma-
ny witnesses there are to her being out. Yet she
was but seventeen years old, and had always lived
secluded. Miss Rogers was twenty-three. A hun-
dred knew <i>her</i> to one who knew the other. It is
therefore impossible that she should have gone to
Hoboken, or to Jane street, without being recogniz-
ed by a dozen persons; yet no one has come for-
ward who saw her outside of her mother's door, and
there is no evidence except the testimony concerning
her <i>expressed intention</i>, that she did go out at all.—
Her gown was torn, bound round her, and tied; and
by <i>that</i> the body was carried as a bundle. If the
murder had been committed at Hoboken, there would
have been no necessity for any such arrangement. The
fact that the body was found floating near Hoboken,
is no proof as to where it was thrown into the water.
The murder must have been committed near to her
mother's house, and the nearer, the more likely.—
There are places within a few rods of the door,
where such a deed would be as likely to be commit-
ted as any where in the city. A piece of one of the
unfortunate girl's petticoats, two feet long and one
foot wide, was torn out and tied under her chin and
around the back of her head, probably to prevent
her screams. This was done by fellows who had no
pocket <u title="handkerchief (elsewhere)">handkerchiefs</u>.
   Perhaps these considerations are not new to the
police, but they need, we think, to be considered by
the neighborhood. In our judgment the unhappy
girl had not proceeded many steps, when she was in-
duced for some purpose to step within a door, which
was closed upon her, and she was there murdered,
during Sunday. It was probably not a parlor, or
bedroom, or any part of a dwelling house, nor a pub-
lic place of any sort.—<i>Jour. of Com.</i>

			<m9><b>For The Tribune.</b></m9>
   T<small>HE</small> M<small>URDER OF</small> M<small>ISS</small> R<small>OGERS</small>.—The opinion I believe
is pretty general that Miss Rogers was <i>not seen</i> on Sunday,
25th July, after leaving her mother's house, and such, I per-
ceive, by the Tribune of this day, is also your opinion. I be-
lieve, however, that she <i>was seen</i> by two persons in the
morning of the 25th July, and I arrive at this conclusion as
follows:
   1. G. W. Dixon says he saw her on the 25th July in com-
pany with a man (who answers the description given of
Morse,) in Ann st. near Theatre Alley, at about 10 o'clock,
A. M. This statement was made by him to Mr. Hugh <u>Pat-
tison</u> on the day or day after the finding of the body at Hobo-
ken.
   2. Mr. John Conroy testifies that he met Morse in Ann
st. near Broadway on Sunday, 25th July, between 10 and
10½ o'clock, A. M.—That Morse was in company with <i>a
very handsome and well dressed female</i>—that he has known
Morse for several years and spoke to him as he passed in
Ann street.
   3. If for any reason the statement of Dixon cannot be fully
relied on, is it not fully and satisfactorily corroborated by
the testimony of Mr. Conroy?
   With regard to this mysterious murder I trust that you
and every other Editor will continue to keep it before the
people. When is the Mayor to offer a reward?

	<b>The Mary Rogers Mystery.</b>
   No further developments have been made in rela-
tion to the alleged murder and violation of Mary C.
Rogers, not have any arrests been made by either
the Upper or Lower Police authorities. Many peo-
ple now begin to believe that Mary has not been
murdered, after all, and although the behaviour of
her family and especially of her quondam lover,
Payne, would seem to favor such an hypothesis, yet
still it does seem incredible that the clothes of Mary
should be found on the body of a stranger. For it
will be observed that although Mary's <u>lovers</u> and
family would not, or could not, recognize the body,<!-- Crommelin recognized the body, and even "rubbed her arm for the purpose of identifying her". -->
yet three of them swear to the clothes she had on.
It is also very strange that no one should see her
after her interview with Payne, at 10 o'clock on the
Sunday she disappeared, and that the object of her
leaving <i>the rose</i> at <u>Cromelin</u>'s lodgings should never
have been explained, nor the public be able to learn
whether or not she repeated her visit to Mr. C., on
the Sunday <i>after she had paid a farewell visit to Payne</i>.
Then the fact which is alleged, that old Mrs. Rogers
told her negro servant after Mary had left for her
aunt's, “that in all probability they should never
see Mary again alive,” would seem to favor the no-
tion that Mary's fate was expected by her nearest
relative.
   We throw out these facts, for just what they are
worth in the absence of all other testimony, than
what we have hitherto given to our readers. We
believe we have given every particle of evidence
adduced either at Hoboken or here, since the find-
ing of the body, and we shall not let the matter
sleep.<a id="Herald-1841-08-25-Marys-mother"></a>
   The house 126 Nassau street, is now unten-
anted, and Mary's mother has removed to the resi-
dence of a Mr. O'Hara, a surgeon, in Jane street.
Mrs. Rogers is not so infirm a woman, as people
would seem to believe, and this fact may be of im-
portance in any subsequent inquiries, as her age is
adduced as an excuse for her not going to Hoboken
to recognize the body of her daughter. There is
yet a mystery in this business, which time alone can
unravel.

			POLICE.
   <i>The case of Mary C. Rogers.</i>—An absurd story
was circulated yesterday in the city, by a penny pa-
per (the Planet,) that a letter had been received from
Pittsburg, Pa., stating that M<small>ARY</small> C. R<small>OGERS</small> had
been there in company with a man named G<small>ETCHELL</small>
—that she had left this city with him, having left a
letter on her table informing her mother of the step
she had taken, and that immediately upon hearing
this, Mr. Crommelin had started for Illinois. In the
first place, no such letter has been received. In the
second place, Mr. Crommelin was in the city yester-
day, P. M., as large as life, and we did not learn that
he had any intention of migrating to Illinois, and in
the 3d place, Mary C. Rogers being dead and buried,
could not very well have written any letter. These
stories at the best are ill advised, and have a tenden-
cy only to keep up a feverish excitement in the com-
munity; to check the efforts of the authorities in
ferreting out her murderers, and can only serve one
end, i. e. the sale of the paper that can say most up-
on the subject. The papers have have already been
filled to repletion with details of this case, and we
trust no more will be said until something definite is
known.

   T<small>HE</small> M<small>ARY</small> <u>R<small>ODGERS</small></u> M<small>YSTERY</small>.—This affair is
as much in the dark as ever. It has been stated that
Morse, on the fatal Sunday, was seen walking with
her through Ann street, as early as ten o'clock. We
are informed that this is not the fact. He never saw
her, and did not know her. One thing we should
like to know—“who are the two men who swore,
at the police office, that they saw Morse sitting with
Mary <u>Rodgers</u>, at Hoboken, on the fatal evening?”
They identified, as it was called, Morse, at the Police
office. Who are these men? Ought they not to be
examined at once before they attempt to swear away
the life of another man? Is not their evidence very
mysterious in the face of the girl in black, and the
Staten Island hotel-keeper?
   While on this subject, a friend of Morse's has
handed us the annexed for publication:—
<m9>   <i>Mr. Morse</i>.—Now that the press has sufficiently black
balled the character of Mr. Morse, owing to his very
shallowly supposed participation in the murder of Miss
<u>Rodgers</u>, and that he has entirely vindicated himself from
all shadow of suspicion in that matter, it may be time to
do him a little justice. Some of the papers have stated
that he was a rowdy and a gambler; if so, it has been
without the knowledge of himself, or of his nearest
friends; and he challenges any person to come forward
and prove the allegation. He has been accused of abusing
his wife; and this is also an error; Mr. Morse, owing
to some domestic difficulties, to which all families are
liable, has been separated from his wife for upwards of
six month, and she had threatened a suit against him
to the end of compelling him to return; by the advice of
a third person, however, who informed her that the Court
would not entertain the complaint unless she coupled
it with an accusation of personal ill treatment, she
took out a warrant for assault and battery, which is the
full truth of his much bruited about harsh conduct as
regards that matter. To this fact Mrs. M. will testify.
In reference to the affair on Staten Island, it finds a good
deal of <u title="palliation">paliation</u> in the fact that Mr. Morse was six
months separated from his wife when it occurred; and
if this does not in all exonerate him from blame, why let
the man who thinks he is perfect come forward, and cast
the first stone. A statement has been made that Mr.
Morse commenced his business career in this city by
selling newspapers in the street; this is altogether a
gratuitous assertion, as he never sold newspapers in
the street or anywhere else. He arrived in New
York at the age of fourteen, and found immediate
employment in the store of Mr. Buckley, 48 South
street; from thence he went to attend store for Mr. James
Brown in Washington street. Preferring a profession,
however, to a clerkship, he engaged himself on trial to
Mr. Montania, a lapidary in Reed street. While here, he
amused himself with carving images on blocks of wood,
which were seen by a publisher, who perceiving that
the bent of his genius inclined that way, persuaded him
to adopt wood engraving as a profession, a suggestion
which met his approbation, and thereon he applied him-
self without any superintendence, or instruction, to the
graving of wood; and his present eminence in his pro-
fession, (for it is going not a whit too far to say, that he
is second to none in this city,) is the result. His first at-
tempt at cutting in wood was made with a three square
file, and even the rough production then and thus made,
found its way into a paper. In evidence of Mr. Morse's
high stand among the artists in his line in this city, it
may be observed <i>en passant</i>, that he has taken two sil-
ver medals for the best specimens of wood engraving;
one at the Mechanics' Institute last year, and the other at
the Fair of the American Institute the year before. This
latter fact says more than a volume in proof, that Mr.
Morse is neither rowdy <u>or</u> a gambler, but a gentleman
who attends to his business.</m9>
   On the other hand, we have received the follow-
ing from the mother of the girl in black:—
<m9>M<small>R</small>. E<small>DITOR</small>:—
   I have been called on to state, for the benefit of those it
may interest, that my place of residence is not in <i>Morton</i>
street. Having been obliged to leave the city, and not
wishing to interrupt the study of my daughter, I left her
to board with a friend in that street. Also, she was never
at a ball, or any place of amusement; never worked at
the type foundry, or any other trade; had not arrived at
her 16th year; did not intend to send her to <i>Staten Island
Seminary</i>; was preparing to move in the country, when
I received a shock that nothing but the grace of God will
enable me to bear.</m9>
   Altogether, this murder is one of the greatest mys-
teries of blood that ever was perpetrated. Yet we
do not despair of discovering the monsters. The
murderers of old Captain White, of Salem, were en-
veloped in as deep a mystery for about six weeks,
but they were discovered at last. What, then, is to
be done? Let every fellow's face and actions be
watched when the tale of blood is told. The perpe-
trators cannot sit quietly under that story of blood.
They will betray themselves in some point. Such
was the case with the <u>Crowningshields</u> and Knapp
of Boston. As to the story told that Mary <u>Rodgers</u>
is still alive—it is base and foolish.
   Since the above was written, our Reporter has as-
certained that nothing is known at present in rela-
tion to any trace of the murderers of Mary Rogers,
at either of the police offices. At the Egyptian
Tombs the magistrates say frankly that they give up
all hope of <u title="ferreting">feretting</u> them out; but the magnates
of the Upper Police shake their heads, and hope to
be more successful with the next runaway they get
hold of. All the authorities, however, concur in the
opinion that the identification of the body found at
Hoboken was full and complete. And they ask, too,
with great force, if that was not the body of Mary
Rogers, whose body was it, and how came the
clothes of Mary to be found thereon?
   It is said that old Mrs. Rogers burnt up a bundle
of letters belonging to Mary on the day of the in-
quest. This ought to be explained.

   H<small>ORRIBLE</small> S<small>TATE OF</small> A<small>FFAIRS</small>.—Since the oc-
currence of what is believed to have been a brutal
violation and murder of the ill-starred Miss Rogers,
we have received a large number of communica-
tions, informing us of the haunts in this city of
gangs of miscreants who are believed to be in the
habit of committing the most diabolical outrages
upon unprotected persons and property. To some
of the best authenticated of these, we have given
place in our columns; while others were either
not of a nature suitable for publication, or were
not sufficiently authentic to warrant us in making
them public. If but half of what has been com-
municated to us is true, the lives and safety of our
citizens are in most appalling and disgraceful jeo-
pardy, and it is safer to venture among the wildest
hordes of Bedouins than to hazard one's self be-
yond the eye and immediate protection of our po-
lice, or the reach of social protection. The su-
burbs of our city are at the mercy of gangs of
lawless desperadoes, who make reprisals and cap-
tures on the waters on either side of our island,
and perpetrate the most fiendish outrages upon the
adjacent shores. Who can read the following
statement—(and we believe every word of it)—
without shuddering at the boldness and impunity
with which the most demoniac wickedness
	“Stalks unrevenged among us.”
   Nor is the gang here spoken of the only one in
this city of like character, employed in like pur-
suits, of which we have recently become inform-
ed. The vicinities of several other markets and
public places near the water, are cursed with simi-
lar crews of wretches; and many of their mani-
fold transgressions that would put the blush upon
the cheek of the most heartless pirate that ever
dangled from a yard-arm, have been communicat-
ed to us.
   Why is this horrible and disgraceful state of
things allowed to remain as it is? The police
cannot but be aware of its existence, and of some
of the horrors which it has produced. All that is
needed to put an end to it is a prompt and vigo-
rous interference on the part of the municipal au-
thorities—or, that not being attainable, on the part
of our citizens themselves. How long would
such a gang as our correspondent describes, be
able to perpetrate their iniquities without meeting
summary justice, in any other city in the Union?
Not forty-eight hours. An opportunity is now af-
forded to begin the work of reform in this matter
in an efficacious and certain manner. Our corres-
pondent offers to place the vindication of the laws,
and the retribution due to justice, in the reach of
the proper authorities, if the dreadfully injured
parties will but afford the facility they alone can
give. We doubt not he will fulfil his pledge.—
Shall it be done now, or shall we have to wait till
more outrages at which the thought revolts and
humanity shudders—more rapine, and more mur-
ders, were perpetrated? Let prompt and ener-
getic action in the right quarter answer for us.
   We did not see the paragraph in the Sunday
paper referred to, and consequently are not aware
which of the many like transactions known to
have occurred, is referred to in it. Those more im-
mediately interested in it will however, readily
understand to what it alludes; and it is due to
the peace and safety and honor of our city, that
they without delay, extend the co-operation asked
for.
   Our correspondent writes:
<l9 id="Sun-1841-08-26-Weehawken">   T<small>O THE</small> E<small>DITOR OF THE</small> S<small>UN</small>:—S<small>IR</small>—The
name of Roberts mentioned in a Sunday paper as
one of a party in a club boat who took a girl from
another boat and transferred her to their own, and
afterwards violated her in the thickets at Wee-
hawken, need not be mentioned only, as it is well
known in the neighborhood of the Clinton market,
(known from the boasting of the very parties them-
selves who were in the boat with Roberts and vi-
olated the woman alluded to in the Sunday pa-
per,) that a gang of the worst set of rowdies hang
around the porter houses in the vicinity of the
market. They own a club boat, and are in the
daily practice of prowling along the shores of Ho-
boken with their boat, and forcibly taking in any
females they can find, who may be but slightly
guarded, and then forcing them in the woods to a
consummation of their brutal wishes. These fel-
lows are skilful oarsmen, and can in a few mo-
ments outstrip almost any pursuers in speed. If
they be closely pressed by the friends of their vic-
tims, they will fight with the fury of demons and
overpower almost any opposition. They are a
very desperate set, nay, the terror of the neigh-
borhood, as the citizens around the market to their
sorrow can testify. These fellows make no se-
crets of their hellish tricks, but make a point of
boasting of the successful issue of their adven-
tures. Roberts is the best man among them all;
and it is only when intoxicated that he will ever
join them in evil fellowship. I heard one of the
gang telling another who had been out of town,
that one Friday afternoon ten of them took a girl
in the woods, and each one violated her, “<i>till she
foamed at the mouth, by J—s!</i>” These were the
very words—at which they set up a hearty
laugh—it being to them the most capital joke in
the world, to thus treat a poor female.
   These chaps have no visible means of earning
a living, for they won't work, but have a <u title="knack">nack</u> of
getting along somehow. I heard them boasting on
Friday last of the “fun” they had with the girl
they took out of the boat in company with Rob-
erts, as alluded to in the Sunday paper, and I have
no reason to doubt of their guilt. Now, Mr. Edi-
tor, if the friends of the girl wish to confront these
fellows with the girl herself, in order to ascertain
their identity, I will give them their names in full,
by their merely requesting through your paper
such an announcement.

   T<small>HE</small> M<small>ARY</small> R<small>OGERS</small> A<small>FFAIR</small>.—This bloody affair
seems to furnish a great deal of twaddle to the penny
papers. One attempts to prove that Mary Rogers
is still alive—another states that she is at Pittsburgh,
and another that her own friends had something to
do with her death. It is even sought to be proved,
that Doctor Cook of Hoboken, a very eminent phy-
sician, knows nothing of his profession—and that
his evidence is not to be believed.
   What is the meaning of all this effort to <u>mistify</u>
and lead astray? Is it not produced by the arts and
appliances of those who may be the perpetrators?—
or who know who they are? It looks very suspi-
cious at least. As far as human testimony can go,
it is proved, beyond the possibility of a doubt, that
<i>Mary Rogers was violated and murdered by more
than two persons</i>—and, according to all probability,
that this horrid act was perpetrated in some stable,
outhouse, or such place, by one of those gangs of
rowdies, blacklegs, gamblers, or soaplocks, who
form the society of the houses of ill fame, and the
low gambling shops.
   Can this be controverted with any degree of force?
What can be the motive of those who lead astray
the public mind? Certainly not good. Let it be
followed up.
<m9>			[From our Reporter.]
   Justice <s>Stevens</s> is of opinion that the police have ob-
tained some clue to the miscreants who perpetrated the
outrage and murder on Mary Rogers, but that it will be
some days yet before the inquiry will be in such a shape
as to justify the authorities in making the matter public.
The clerks of the upper police also profess to believe that
they have got on the right scent this time, and that if the
newspapers would cease “their agitation,” the truth
would be elicited. These gentlemen say that people will
not come forward, lest they should have their names
dragged before the public, and that, but for the discus-
sion which has been kept up, they think they should
have traced out Mary's whereabouts, on the fatal Sun-
day, before this. If there are any such people as these
in existence, all we have to say about them is, that they
are either very wicked, or very foolishly wicked, if
they neglect to aid the public authorities in tracing out
the hiding place of a gang of ravishers and murderers,
and foolish if they would suffer their own <u title="thin-skinnedness">thin-skined-
ness</u> to stand for one moment between their prejudices
and the sacred cause of public justice. If say man, rich
or poor, possessing the respectability of wealth or not,
has remained quiet whilst in the possession of any fact
which could tend to clear up this mystery, we envy not
his notions of right, or yet the advantages of such a ne-
gation of respectability as he seems to hug himself up in.
We are told, on good authority, that some such person
is to be examined, but think he must have been hoaxing
the magistrates. In the mean time, the actual fact of the
girl's murder is doubted by many well-informed persons.</m9>

	MURDER OF MARY C. ROGERS.
   We stated last week that Joseph W. Morse,
had been arrested on suspicion of being the mur-
derer of this ill fated girl; but it seems he is in-
nocent of that crime although guilty of one but
little less heinous. He ought to be hung for his
bad character.
   T<small>HE</small> M<small>URDER OF</small> M<small>ISS</small> R<small>OGERS</small>.—<i>Morse not
now supposed to be the Murderer</i>.—Strange and
various as were the circumstances tending to im-
plicate Morse in the murder of Miss Rogers, sub-
sequent development seem to show that he had
nothing to do with it.
   Morse, from the time he was first arrested, per-
sisted in saying that he was at Staten Island, on
the afternoon and night of the Sunday when it was
alleged he was seen at Hoboken. He, however,
could not tell the name of a female, who, he said,
accompanied him and remained there with him all
night; nor could he tell the name of any person
who had seen him there. His alleged ignorance
of her name rendered his statement incredible.—
The Mayor, however, went down to Staten Is-
land, on Wednesday afternoon, and ascertained
that a man answering the description of Morse,
passed that Sunday night at one of the hotels at
Staten Island, along with a young girl, about 17
years old. Yesterday morning the name of the
girl was discovered, and she was brought to the
upper Police Office, where she deposed that on
the afternoon of the Sunday in question, she met
Morse in Bleecker street, and that he induced her
to accompany him to Staten Island; that under
one or other pretext he detained her there until
the last boat for New York had left the Island,
and that he then persuaded her to pass the night
in the same room with him; and that during the
night he endeavored to have improper intercourse
with her, but that she did not allow him; and that
on the following day, Monday, he came back with
her to N. York and took his leave of her at the
corner of Barclay and Greenwich street. As the
young lady, however indiscreet she may have ac-
ted, is said to have hitherto maintained a good
character, we forbear to mention her name.
   The testimony of the girl is further corrobora-
ted by the fact of four individuals, namely, Messrs.
<u title="James (elsewhere)">John</u> Conner, W. H. Hicks, R. <u title="Backer, Becker (elsewhere)">Bucker</u> and W. J.
McKee, having on that Sunday, about three o'-
clock in the afternoon, seen Morse and the young
lady walking down Broadway towards the Batte-
ry. These gentlemen knew both Morse and the
lady, and as one of the above gentlemen had been
known to pay particular attentions to the lady on
some former occasions, another of the party re-
marked to him, “There goes your girl.” There
can therefore be scarcely a doubt that the person
seen sitting on the bench at Hoboken, with Miss
Rogers or some other young lady on that Sunday,
was not Morse, and so far he seems to have ex-
culpated himself from the charge of murdering
Miss Rogers.—<i>Jour. of Commerce of Friday</i>.
   The evening edition of the same paper contains
the following article.
   It now turns out if Morse's statement can be re-
lied on that he never had any acquaintance with
Miss Rogers, nor could he identify her from any
other female in the city. Nor did he know the name
of the girl, as he has all along alleged, who so im-
prudently accompanied him to Staten Island.—
And when he heard of the body of Miss Rogers
having been found in the river, he supposed that
it was Miss Rogers who had accompanied him to
Staten Island, and who felt so degraded by re-
maining with him all night, that she had in con-
sequence committed suicide by drowning herself.
This suspicion on his part shows that the fellow
must have a tolerable correct appreciation of the
feelings of a virtuous female, in consequence of
having so indiscreetly subjected herself to insult
and loss of character, for the young lady who did
accompany him, has been so deeply affected by
the occurrence and the consequent ordeal she was
obliged to go through at the upper Police Office,
in being most minutely examined as to every thing
which occurred between her and Morse, that she
yesterday morning procured laudanum to destroy
herself, and only for an accidental and timely dis-
covery of her intentions by her family, she would
probably have <u title="succeeded in her purpose (Evening-Post-1841-08-21)">been at this time another victim</u>.
   Morse, although discharged from the complaint
against him for the murder of Miss Rogers is still
detained in prison until he can procure unques-
tionable bail in the sum of $1000, to answer the
complaint against him for maltreating his wife.<a id="Schenectady-Reflector-1841-08-27-false-scent"></a>
   We are persuaded that pursuit has hitherto been
on a false scent, so far as it has been directed to
Hoboken. It is impossible that a person so well
known to thousands as this young woman was,
should have passed three blocks without some
one having seen her; and any one who saw her
would have remembered it; for she interested all
who knew her. It was when the streets were full
of people that she went out. See how soon the
girl who accompanied Morse to Staten Island was
recognized, and how many witnesses there are to
her being out. Yet she was but seventeen years
old, and had always lived secluded, Miss Rogers
was twenty-three. A hundred knew her to one
who knew the other. It is therefore impossible
that she should have gone to Hoboken, or to Jane
street, without being recognized by a dozen per-
sons; yet no one has come forward who saw
her outside of her mother's door, and there is
no evidence except the testimony concerning her
<i>expressed intention</i>, that she did go out at all. Her
gown was torn, bound round her, and tied; and
by that the body was carried as a bundle. If the
murder had been committed at Hoboken, there
would have been no necessity for any such ar-
rangement. The fact that the body was found floa-
ting near Hoboken, is no proof as to where it was
thrown into the water. The murder must have
been committed near to her mother's house, and
the nearer, the more likely. There are places
within a few rods of the door, where such a deed
would be as likely to be committed as any where
in the city. A piece of one of the unfortunate
girl's petticoats, two feet long and one foot wide,
was torn out and tied under her chin and around
the back of her head, probably to prevent her
screams. This was done by fellows who had no
pocket <u title="handkerchiefs (elsewhere)">handkerchief</u>.
   Perhaps these considerations are not new to the
police, but they need, we think to be considered
by the neighborhood. In our judgement the un-
happy girl had not proceeded many steps, when
she was induced for some purpose to step within
a door, which was closed upon her, and she was
there murdered, during Sunday. It was probably
not a parlor, or bedroom, or any part of a dwell-
ing house, nor a public place of any sort.—<i>Jour.
of Com.</i>

was connected with difficulties between him and
wife, together with a rascally attempt on the honor of
a young female, whom he had decoyed from her home.
He proved himself to be only the <u title="villain">villian</u> of anoth-
er shade. The Journal of Commerce has some very
sensible remarks, in relation to the case of Miss <u>Rodg-
ers</u>. That paper says, that in all the stories connected
with her case, there is no evidence of her leaving her
home, other than her own assertion to do so. From
this fact, that paper reasons, that she met her death
in her own neighborhood, because had she traversed
but one block, so well was she known, she would have
been recognized. We have all along been of the
opinion that the police officers of that city, have been
on the wrong scent, in laying the scene of this tragedy
at Hoboken. We firmly believe that she was murder-
ed in the city of New York, and every probability
goes strongly to show that it was not far from her
home.

			POLICE—Saturday.
   <i>The Case of Mary C. Rogers.</i>—On Saturday a man
was arrested and committed for examination on the
charge of having participated in the outrage and mur-
der of Miss Rogers. As the evidence against him now
is purely circumstantial, we deem it most advisable to
omit his name until something at least definite shall
transpire, as it would hardly be fair to brand a man
with the suspicion of such an outrage, who may be
entirely innocent.
   Beyond the above there was nothing at the Police
Office which would warrant us in occupying space in
the paper to record it.

<d>[Col.4]</d>
<m9>   ☞ Having by the advice of many friends and the often re-
peated assurances of the gentlemen connected with the Police,
which has as yet never been complied with, allowed a certain
class of the penny press to go on from day to day to calumniate
me, without their asking for one moment on what grounds,
whether slight or sufficient. And supposing their vituperation
to be well spent—as it is mere repetition—now to show my fel-
low citizens that I fear no questions and wear no mask. I in the
most public manner demand, wish and expect an open investiga-
tion of all and every part of my conduct in relation to the inqui-
ries respecting the murder of Miss Rogers—no secret inquisitio-
nal proceedings—we will have all the forms of law, and in open
Court, with the reporters and other members of the press pre-
sent, and one reporter sworn to report literally as spoken.—
I also demand that Mrs. Rogers, the mother, Mr. Payne, the
lover, and Mr. Hays, the cousin, shall be present, and also such
other persons as I will name as witnesses shall be summoned,
and that they all answer such questions as shall be put to them
by me, or my counsel, on my having sufficient notice. If such in-
vestigation is granted for me to ascertain the residence of a few
witnesses, say 2 or 3 days. To give some little plea of the
grounds of slander, and the accuracy of the information of the
papers before alluded to, it was near <s>6</s> o'clock before I made up
my mind to differ from my friends, and make any reply what-
ever in the papers. In 20 minutes I ascertained the remains
of Miss Rogers were not interred at the expense of the family,
as Mr. Hays states, confirmed by Mr. Payne, but by the
city. Mr. Callender, Clerk of the Police, paid the under-
taker the whole of the expense, $29 <s>??</s>, also, it was not at
the early hour he states, but quarter to 12 o'clock, at noon; fur-
ther, no person followed, but a stout man in a brown coat, took
a cab, and went to the Carmine st. church, where it was depos-
ited. For the accuracy of this, I refer Mr. McCadden, the Un-
dertaker, who has kindly allowed me to make use of his name.
So one story is very good, but there is two sides to it.

   T<small>HE</small> M<small>ARY</small> R<small>OGERS</small> M<small>YSTERY</small>.—The lamentable out-
rage, so disgraceful to the character of our “moral and
noble city,” seems to be involved now in the most im-
penetrable mystery. The authorities of the upper police
office who were so sanguine of their circumstantial tes-
timony, which was right, doubtless, in every point of
view, but that of identity, now confess that they cannot
make head or tail of the affair. After the acquittal of
Morse, it appears that they arrested some other “genteel
looking man with whiskers,” but he proved an alibi,
and on Friday last was honorably discharged. The de-
positions and the examinations of the accusers and ac-
cused, are carefully veiled from the public eye; the ac-
cusations are made in secret—the trial if it can be called
one, is held in a sort of star chamber to which the public
have no access, and the names of these very veracious
pair of sharp sighted witnesses, who first swore they saw
Morse sitting and quarrelling with the cigar girl at Ho-
boken, on the stormy Sunday night, and since to some one
else, are carefully withheld from the press and the pub-
lic. After this it would be futile to talk of the po-
litical accusations which were <u>dropt</u> into the Lion's
mouth at Venice, of <i>lettres de cashets</i>, and all that sort of
tyrannical machinery, because these proceedings have
been quite as shameful and might have proved as fatal
to both life and reputation.
   The up town authorities having thus given the matter
up, the lower police intend to try their hand again, and
this time Crommelin is to appeal to a judicial tribunal;
and it was rumored on Saturday night, that his friend
Padley, is for some reason or other placed in the tombs.
   Since the above was written, we have ascertained from
Mr. Hyde, the keeper of the city prison, that Archibald
W. Padley, was committed to his custody on the evening
of the 27th instant, by the order of Justice Parker; that
Padley stands charged with the abduction, rape, and
murder of Mary Cecilia Rogers. If the examination, <u title="or">on</u>
the grounds for the accusation and imprisonment of this
person are ever made public, we suppose that the mystery
of the rose will be explained, and the probabilities ascer-
tained of Mary Rogers having visited Crommelin on the
Sunday, after she called on Payne. From the first we
have called attention to this circumstance.
   A<small>NOTHER</small> O<small>UTRAGE ON A</small> D<small>EFENCELESS</small> F<small>EMALE</small>.—The
keeper of one of the most fashionable brothels in the
city, who is known to all the elite of the upper crust
soaplock fraternity, by the style and title of Madame la
<u title="duchesse">duchese</u> de Berry, was arrested by Prince John, and
brought before the Magistrate, charged with the perpe-
tration of one of the most violent and atrocious assaults
which one she-devil ever inflicted on another of the
same sex. Mary Capeto, a young and very beautiful
girl of seventeen, stated that she boarded for some
time with <i>la duchesse</i>, and that on Friday she entered
her apartment, seized complainant by the throat, threw
her on the bed, and then tore her face, neck and throat
in such a way that if assistance had not been at hand,
the consequences might have been fatal. The Magis-
trate ordered <i>Madame</i> to find bail in the sum of $500,
which, after some delay, she procured, in the person of
James McAllister, of Division street, and Madame was
then liberated from the tombs, with the comfortable as-
surance from “his eminence Prince John,” that a civil
suit would be instituted, and the damages laid at some-
where near five thousand dollars.

   T<small>HE</small> M<small>ARY</small> R<small>OGER'S</small> M<small>YSTERY</small>.—The whole coun-
try is beginning to feel an interest in the brutal vio-
lation and murder of Mary Rogers. Read the fol-
lowing:—
<m9>			P<small>HILADELPHIA</small>, Aug. 27, 1841.
M<small>R</small>. B<small>ENNETT</small>:—
   The mystery which yet surrounds the terrible case
of Miss Rogers, excites in this community, intense
anxiety—the <u title="'efforts' in Schenectady Reflector">effects</u> by your police to discover the
authors of this “murder most foul” are properly esti-
mated, and do receive merited commendation.
   It has been intimated in your paper of yesterday,
that by persevering efforts the <u title="villains">villians</u> will eventual-
ly be brought to punishment, and it is to be hoped
that <u title="perseverance">perseverence</u> will be unremitted.
   Whether you have any recollection or knowledge
of a case somewhat similar, which occurred in New
York, very many years ago, I do not know. It was
that of a certain Levi Weeks (whose brother, a most
estimable man, was then the owner of the City Ho-
tel.) Levi was charged with the abduction and
murder of a Miss Sands, who was taken from her
sister's house in <u title="Greenwich">Greenwick</u> street, conveyed by her
lover, to whom she was engaged to be married, on
a cold winter night, and in a then lonely street,
thrown into a well of large size owned by the <u title="Manhattan">Man-
hatten</u> Company. Being missed, she was sought for
and there found, with marks of violence on her per-
son, showing great <u title="resistance">resistence</u>, and proving the strong
efforts made to preserve herself—her lacerated fin-
gers, &c.
   Now, Sir, the circumstance excited an intense con-
cern, as does the case of Miss Rogers. So great was
the rush to see the body, that it was deemed proper
to place it in the public street, where many thou-
sands looked upon it—among them the writer of
this.
   Weeks was arrested—circumstances were ex-
tremely strong against him, and although acquitted
by the Jury, public feeling was such that he left your
city and never returned to it—he died a vagabond.
   Cadwallader D. Colden was then the Attorney Gen-
eral, and among the witnesses who were introduced
for the defendant, was one individual, whose name I
do not now recollect, who was one of the fatal
sleighing party. Mr. Colden was extremely close in
his examination of that man, and was impressed
with a belief that he was the actual murderer.
   Some time afterwards the witness was indicted
for committing a forgery—and it was most re-
markable that, in that trial, circumstances were de-
veloped which induced Mr. Colden to say, “that is
the murderer of Miss Sands.”
   It would therefore seem, that despite of all the
machinations of the Devil and his imp, that by a
wise Providence “murder will out.”
   I refer you to the documents of that day, and
think you may make a good moral use of the facts.
			Yours,			W. C.</m9>

   T<small>HE CASE OF</small> M<small>ARY</small> C. R<small>OGERS</small>.—Much has
been said in the New York papers during the last
month respecting the sudden disappearance and
most villainous murder of Miss Mary C. Rogers,
who has been long and well known there as the
“beautiful cigar girl.” She was employed, usu-
ally, in a cigar store, and is reported to have pos-
sessed great personal beauty. It seems that she
was last seen on Sunday morning, on the 25th
of July, when she told a young man, <u title="Daniel (elsewhere)">David</u>
Payne, to whom she was engaged to be married,
that she was going to visit at Mrs. Downing's
who resided in a distant part of the city. She
never went there, and for some days no trace
of her could be found; a body was soon after dis-
covered at Hoboken, which was recognized as
hers, though greatly disfigured. The police of
New York were unwearied in their efforts, but
for weeks no clue was found to trace out the per-
petrator of this inhuman crime. A young man,
by the name of Morse, was arrested, and for a
time it was thought that they had finally discov-
ered the murderer, but he proved that he was in
another place at the time the murder must have
been committed, and consequently was discharg-
ed. Every possible surmise has been made, and
every little circumstance seized upon to unravel
the mystery. Some papers have even denied that
the body found is that of Miss Rogers, and a let-
ter had been published, as coming from a gentle-
man in Pittsburg, who had lately seen her, and
the opinion has obtained some credence that she
had eloped to avoid an unpleasant marriage con-
nection that her mother would compel her to
form. But as far as we can learn, there seems to
be but little question but that the body found is
that of Miss Rogers. The following, which we
take from the <a href="#Courier-1841-08-16" class="l">Courier and Enquirer</a>, seems to
contain the latest information, but yet we fear it
may prove erroneous:
   “We are pleased to be able to state, that at
length, a clue has, beyond all doubt or cavil, been
	...
community, for his success in this outrageous af-
fair.”
   The letter referred to above in pronounced to
be a hoax, got up by the penny papers of the city.

   T<small>HE</small> M<small>ARY</small> R<small>OGERS</small> M<small>YSTERY</small>.—Every thing in re-
lation to this lamentable affair seems to be clothed,
not merely with some impenetrable mystery, but to
be conducted by the authorities with a greater de-
gree of <u title="secrecy">secresy</u>, and consequently of injustice, than
most other judicial investigations. We stated on
Monday that Archibald W. <u>Pabley</u> was arrested on
the 27th, and committed to the tombs by order of
Justice Parker. On Monday evening we applied to
Mr. Hyde, the keeper of the prison, to know if any
thing had been done in the premises, and were in-
formed that <u>Pabley</u> was still in custody. On the
following morning the keeper of the prison received
a discharge for <u>Pabley</u>, and on sending to the interior
for the purpose of liberating the innocent man, he,
the keeper, first learned officially, that <u>Pabley</u> had
been got out the day previous by Justice Parker and
discharged. We know of no greater act of tyranny
than this, even among the high handed measures <u>of
of</u> this said <u title="Miln">Milne</u> Parker, Esquire, one of the special
justices, et cetera. He first causes a man to be ar-
rested on suspicion of three of the very highest of-
fences known to our laws, viz: abduction, rape and
murder. He subjects this man to the solitude of the
tombs, conceals the facts of his arrest from the pub-
lic, keeps him in durance for three days, then sub-
mits him to a star chamber examination, and finally
lets this man out of prison, so far surreptitiously, that
the keeper of the prison is not informed of the pri-
soner's release until some fifteen hours after the ac-
tion of this learned and astute special justice! Com-
ment on this procedure we could make, but we for-
bear, for Justice Parker has to appear to answer to a
whole catalogue of accusations on the 7th inst. be-
fore the County Court, and we may be charged with
a desire to prejudge his case, and for <i>that</i> reason
we forbear, and leave <u>Pabley</u> to his civil remedy, for
we presume, that though “he is only a foreigner,”
that the libery of the citizen cannot be thus out-
rageously violated without some remedy being pro-
vided under our laws. And it must not be forgotten
that he is the fourth person who has been arrested
and discharged without the shadow of proof being
exhibited against him. In the mean time, the names
of the accusers are carefully concealed. We ask if
this is right? It may be law, but it is not justice.

   M<small>ISS</small> R<small>OGERS</small>.—We have heretofore <u title="inadvertently">in-
advertantly</u> omitted to give an account of
the supposed murder of Miss Rogers, who
has, for some length of time attended the ci-
gar store of Mr. Anderson in the city of N.
Y. and was well known as the “beautiful ci-
gar girl.” The last that was seen of her
she was on board the ferry boat going to
Hoboken. A few days after the disappear-
ance a body was found in the River which
was supposed to be that of Miss Rogers, ha-
ving such marks upon as left no room to
doubt her fate. The person seen in compa-
ny with her on the evening of her disappear-
ance, has been arrested for the murder, but
acquitted upon his proving that he was not
in Hoboken on the evening specified. Much
excitement prevails in the city upon the sub-
ject. The Journal of Commerce says that
a letter has been received from Pittsburgh,
stating that Miss Rogers was in that city in
company with a gentleman, on her way to
her uncle's, in Illinois. The only thing that
gives credence to this story is the fact that
some two or three years ago, Miss Rogers,
while employed in the same establishment,
disappeared very mysteriously; for the pur-
pose, as was afterwards supposed, of help-
ing the sale of her employer's goods. After
the smoke of the extra cigars sold during the
excitement had cleared away, she returned
and resumed her station.

<h2>Mary Had No Respect for the Sabbath</h2>

================================================================
<d>[Col.1]</d>
   <b>A Warning to Young Ladies, from the Grave.</b>
   Great excitement has prevailed in this city for some
days past, in consequence of the murder of a Miss Ro-
gers, who has been extensively known here as the “beau-
tiful Cigar Girl,” and who was for a length of time em-
ployed in a cigar store in Broadway. She left home on
Sabbath morning two weeks since, to go, as it was sup-
posed, to Hoboken, but did not return; and when, after
three days' search was made for her, the body was found
in the water, bearing marks of having been most shock-
ingly abused, and then murdered. No discovery of the
dreadful secret has yet been made, by the utmost vigi-
lance of the police, and a profound darkness hangs over
the whole transaction.
   Two things, however, have been clearly proved by the
developments already made—that this unfortunate girl
had no respect for the sanctity of the Sabbath, and that
she was far from select in the choice of her associates.
Her own character is said to have been good, but that of
some of the men implicated in this matter, and who were,
it seems, her familiar acquaintances, is from their own
confession, far from reputable. The impression has
forced itself upon us from day to day, as the circumstan-
ces connected with her death are given to the public, that
the dangers in the pathway of the young female, espe-
cially in our large cities, have never yet been adequately
estimated or presented. If she has the almost fatal gift
of beauty, how many, on every side, will lie in wait to en-
snare and destroy! Hundreds of the young of our sex,
who are dependent on their own industry or ingenuity for
a subsistence, have no parents—others, though not liter-
ally orphans, have fathers or mothers, who, through vice,
ignorance, or imbecility, are incapable of guiding or re-
straining them, and thus they are left, at the most critical
period of life, to follow the dictates of interest, or vanity,
or passion, with none to warn or direct them. Acquaint-
ances are soon made with those of the other sex, who are
on the look-out for this very class—and then follows an
invitation to the public gardens, the theatre, or some
place of public amusement on the Sabbath. Tempters
are at hand to urge the inexperienced girl, who perhaps
from a lingering remembrance of Sabbath school instruc-
tion, hesitates—and as it is only the first step which counts,
when this is taken, her descent is easy. She becomes
impatient of control—reckless of her employers, and care-
<d>[Col.2]</d>
less in the choice of her associates; and the one idea of
dress and amusement fills up her sleeping and waking
thoughts. Now, without a special interposition of Provi-
dence, what is to save one on the brink of such a preci-
pice from making the last fatal plunge? True, she may
not find, like Cecilia Rogers, an early and bloody grave;
but is it no less true in one case than in the other—“<i>the
companion of fools</i> shall be destroyed?”
   Mothers, who feel for the welfare of your own daugh-
ters, an intense anxiety which language is inadequate to
express, let us plead with you in their behalf, and in be-
half of others as innocent and lovely, who have none to
teach, and pity, and shelter them. The natural heart does
not love the commands of God. There must be line upon
line, and precept upon precept, to counteract its vicious
tendencies, and implant right principles. Let your chil-
dren learn from you, to keep God's Sabbath, and to rever-
ence his sanctuary, and to avoid the very appearance of
evil, in the character of those with whom they associate.
A man who has no regard for virtue—who will destroy
female innocence—will, if a sufficiently strong motive is
presented, murder her whom he has seduced from the
path of rectitude, and there can be no safety, either for
soul or body, in the society of such an one.
   But it is not your own children alone, who have claims
on you in reference to this matter. Your domestics—
the youthful seamstress employed by you—in short, all
the young females around you, who have no mother to
guide and guard their steps—demand your sympathy and
your efforts in their behalf. One kind word of advice or
warning, given in the spirit of love, may arrest them when
on the verge of ruin, and save them for time and eternity.
The feeling that there are none to care for them, and that
the false friends who flatter but to betray, are the only be-
ings who have an interest in their welfare—has been fa-
tal to many an artless girl, who, under proper influen-
ces, might have been an ornament to society. There is
a vast amount of responsibility and of guilt resting some-
where in reference to this matter. Let each one of us
see to it, that our garments are not stained with the blood
of these murdered souls.
   One word to the young ladies into whose hands this
paper may fall, and we have done. A voice from the
grave—from an untimely and dishonored grave—speaks
to you in tones of warning and entreaty. Had Cecilia
Rogers loved the house of God—had she reverenced the
Sabbath—had she refused to associate with unprincipled
and profligate men—how different had been her fate!
The penalty annexed to the violation of God's law, has
been, in this case, suddenly and fearfully exacted; but
though of the thousands who are following her example,
few may meet such a fate—the day of reckoning will
come, and their judgment slumbereth not.
   Dear young friends, let this solemn warning sink deep
into your hearts when you are tempted to pride and vani-
ty—to be impatient of wise restraint—to seek your own
pleasure on God's holy day—or to listen to the syren
voice which would lure you from the path of virtue—re-
member the fate of the young and beautiful “cigar girl,”
and thank God that you may still choose the path of peace
and safety. Do not, we entreat you, believe for a moment
that the man, whose character is stained with impurity,
or who would tempt you to sin, can be, under any circum-
stances, a safe companion. He is a wolf in sheep's clo-
thing, and waits only his opportunity to deceive and de-
stroy.

   C<small>ORONER'S</small> O<small>FFICE</small>.—The Coroner had his hands full
of business yesterday, although not one of the cases that
came before him, presented any feature of special inter-
est. The first case was at the foot of <u title="Hubert (in Tribune, Courier)">Herbert</u> street on
the body of John Morehead, who was found drowned in
the North River. Verdict accordingly.
	...
   A<small>LMOST A</small> M<small>ARY</small> R<small>OGERS</small> C<small>ASE</small>.—And lastly at the cor-
ner of King and <u title="West (in Tribune)">Varick</u> streets, on the body of a good
looking young girl about 20 years of age, who had no
doubt been but a short time in the water. She was dress-
ed in a calico frock with purple fringes, muslin under
clothes, and had a plain ring on her <u title="third (in Tribune)">forefinger</u>, but neith-
er bonnet, shoes nor hat on. No testimony was adduced
to show who she was or how she came in the water.
Verdict, found drowned. The body was removed to the
dead house, in case any one should be able to identify it.<f>
   D<small>OG</small> K<small>ILLERS</small>, B<small>EWARE</small>.—The only case of either in-
terest or importance before the police yesterday, was a
charge of assaulting with intent to kill, one of the regu-
lar licensed corporation slaughterers of the poor canine
race. The accused was an old Irishman named Patrick
Collins, who lives on his means at No. 360 Madison
street, and it seems that Pat had a favorite which had
grown old along with him, and was to him a friend.
Somehow or other Pat's dog got out of bounds, as other
puppies do, and Gerard Benson, the dog slayer, meeting
with old Pat's dog, gave him his quietus and poked him
into his cart. When Patrick heard what had happened,
he got a pretty ugly looking pistol, which he loaded, be-
ing enough to have killed all the dog slayers in the city,
and sought out the destroyer of his canine friend, whom
he found snug enough at a grog shop hard by. Pat im-
mediately reproached the dog killer with the cowardice
of the deed he had committed, and told him to prepare to
share the fate he had consigned so many other brutes
to. Gerard Benson who fancied all the ghosts of the dead
dogs were come to testify against him, began to quake
in his shoes; but luckily for all parties, old Pat's pistol
missed fire, which mishap as Pat called it, made him quite
ferocious, and he rushed on the other with intent cer-
tainly to do him some bodily harm, whereupon the by-
standers interfered, and prevented further mischief by
disarming the Irishman and bringing him before the
Justice, by whom he was held to bail in $1000.
   There is no question but the conduct of the Irishman
was quite indefensible, but if, as we heard, the dog killer
took advantage of the absence of the owner to destroy a
favorite and valuable dog, he certainly deserved a cow-
skinning therefor. A difference should be made between
a pack of worthless curs, roaming the streets without
home or owner, and a dog properly taken care of, and
one, too, which was only at large by accident. We are
not quite such abstract constructionists as some people,
thank God!</f>

   P<small>OLICE</small> O<small>FFICE</small>.—<i>An assault with intent to kill</i>.—On Tuesday after-
noon Patrick Collins of No. 360 Madison street, went to the residence
of Gerard Benson, colored man, of No. 341 Madison street and saying,
“you are the man that killed my dog,” presented a large pistol loaded
with powder and ball, snapped it twice at Benson with evident intent
to take life. The pistol did not however go off, when Collins attacked
Benson, with dagger under the muzzle of the pistol, and endeavored
to stab him with it, but was prevented by the bystanders and the pistol
taken from him. It appeared that the dog of Collins had been killed
and Benson being one of those employed, under orders of the Mayor
to kill the dogs, was supposed by Collins to be the one that killed him.
Officer H. B. King arrested Collins, who was committed to prison by
Justice Stevens, but yesterday discharged, on giving bail in $1000 to
answer. Collins is 58 years old, a native of Ireland and a man owing
freehold property.

corner of King and <u title="Varick (in Herald)">West</u> street, on the body of an unknown woman,
aged about 20, who was found in the slip, foot of King street yesterday
morning—recently drowned.
   She was clad in a calico frock with small purple figures, muslin un-

had no shoes, stockings or hat on. Verdict, found drowned.
   The body will be left in the dead-house for recognition until noon
this day.
   Also at No. 161 West-street, on the body of John Morehead, alias
Conologue, late a hand on board the sloop Three Friends, of Little
Egg Harbor. He was found early yesterday morning afloat in the
slip foot of Hubert street. Verdict, found drowned.

   G<small>OVERNOR</small> S<small>EWARD</small> W<small>AKED</small> U<small>P</small>.—His Excellency
Wm. H. Seward, Governor of New York, has issued
the following Proclamation:—
<m9>		B<small>Y</small> W<small>ILLIAM</small> H. S<small>EWARD</small>,
	<i>Governor of the State of New York</i>.
		   <b>A Proclamation.</b>
   Whereas Mary C. Rogers, a young woman residing in
the city of New York, was lately ravished and murder-
ed in the said city, or in the portion of the state of New
Jersey contiguous thereto; and whereas the efforts made
by the police of the city of New York to discover the
perpetrators of these crimes have, as appears from the
public prints, proved altogether unsuccessful; and
whereas the peace and security of society require that
such atrocious crimes should not go unpunished:
   Now, therefore, I do hereby declare and make known,
that a reward of seven hundred and fifty dollars will be
paid to whosoever shall give information resulting in the
conviction, either in this state or in the state of New Jer-
sey, of any person guilty of the said crimes.
   And I do hereby enjoin upon all magistrates and other
officers and ministers of justice, that they be diligent in
their efforts to bring the offender or offenders to condign
punishment.
   In testimony whereof, I have caused the privy seal of
	the state to be hereunto affixed, at the city of Al-
 [L. S.] bany, this thirty-first day of August, one thou-
	sand eight hundred and forty-one.
				WILLIAM H. SEWARD.
    By the Governor,
  S<small>AMUEL</small> B<small>LATCHFORD</small>, Private Secretary.</m9>
   Better late than never. This ought to have been
done a month ago, but we suppose it could not be
attended to sooner. It comes from the proper quar-
ter, too. No Governor ever did more to bring the
administration of justice in New York into disre-
pute than Mr. Seward. His high-handed removal
of judges without trial—that of the late Recorder
particularly—his appointment of such old political
hacks as Noah and Lynch—his efforts to disorganize
the municipal government of the city, and to take
away the right of the corporation, have yet to be
atoned for at the bar of public opinion.
   If the present reward, united with that of the peo-
ple's reward, can discover the murderers, we say,
“God speed.”

<d>[Col.3]</d>
   M<small>ORE</small> P<small>RISONERS</small>.—The Police have arrested six or se-
ven young scamps, who are charged with attempting to
ravish a young girl at Hoboken. Not having yet been
informed of the names and particulars of the evidence
against these juvenile soaplocks, of course we are unable
to give them publicity.
   M<small>ORE</small> R<small>OWDYISM</small>.—On Wednesday night, about twelve
o'clock, Captain Fisher, of the Sixth District Watch, was
on duty near Washington market, when he heard a cry
of “watch,” “fire,” and “the Captain” immediately di-
rected two of his subordinates to proceed to the spot and
see what was the matter. The officers could find no fire
or other cause of alarm, but were immediately attacked
by soaplocks, oyster boys, and other longshore loafers.
The Captain immediately advanced to the relief of his
subordinates, and was felled to the ground by a blow on
the head, and also received a stab with a knife, which
proved both deep and dangerous. One of the fellows,
named Mathias Birbank, was immediately apprehended;
subsequently three more of the gang, who gave their
names W. T. Baker, R. Simonson, and John Lowe. They
were all committed, in default of bail.

	THE MARY ROGERS' MYSTERY.
   The whole country is beginning to feel an in-
terest in the brutal violation and murder of Ma-
ry Rogers. Read the following:—
			P<small>HILADELPHIA</small>, Aug. 27, 1841.
   M<small>R.</small> B<small>ENNETT</small>:—The mystery which yet sur-
rounds the terrible case of Miss Rogers, excites
in this community, intense anxiety—the <u title="effects (in Herald)">efforts</u> by
your police to discover the authors of this “mur-
der most foul” are properly estimated, and do re-
ceive merited commendation.
   It has been intimated in your paper of yesterday,
that by persevering efforts the villains will <u title="eventually (in Herald)">event-
fully</u> be brought to punishment, and it is to be
hoped that perseverance will be unremitted.
   Whether you have any recollection or knowl-
edge of a case somewhat similar, which occurred in
N. York, very many years ago, I do not know. It
was that of a certain Levi Weeks, (whose broth-
er, a most estimable man, was then the owner of
the City Hotel.) Levi was charged with the ab-
duction and murder of a Miss Sands, who was ta-
ken from her sister's house in Greenwich street,
conveyed by her lover, to whom she was engaged
to be married, on a cold winter night, and in a
then lonely street, thrown into a well of large
size owned by the Manhattan Company. Being
missed, she was sought for and there found, with
marks of violence on her person, showing great
resistance, and proving the strong efforts made to
preserve herself—her lacerated fingers, &c.
   Now, Sir, the circumstance excited an intense
concern, as does the case of Miss Rogers. So
great was the rush to see the body, that it was
deemed proper to place it in the public street,
where many thousands looked upon it—among
them the writer of this.
   Weeks was arrested—circumstances were ex-
tremely strong against him, and although acquit-
ted by the Jury, public feeling was such that he
left your city and never returned to it—he died a
vagabond.
   Cadwallader D. Colden was then the Attorney
General, and among the witnesses who were in-
troduced for the defendant, was one individual,
whose name I do not now recollect, who was one
of the fatal sleighing party. Mr. Colden was ex-
tremely close in his examination of that man, and
was impressed with a belief that he was the act-
ual murderer.
   Some time afterwards the witness was indict-
ed for committing a forgery—and it was most re-
markable that, in that trial, circumstances were
developed which induced Mr. Colden to say,
“that is the murderer of Miss Sands.”
   It would therefore seem, that despite of all the
machinations of the Devil and his imp, that by a
wise Providence, “murder will out.”
   I refer you to the documents of that day, and
think you may make a good moral use of the facts.
			Yours,			W. C.
   Since the above was written, we have ascer-
tained from Mr. Hyde, the keeper of the city pris-
on, that Archibald W. Padley, was committed to
his custody on the evening of the 27th instant,
by the order of Justice Parker; that Padley stands
charged with the abduction, rape, and murder of
Mary Cecilia Rogers. If the examination, or the
grounds for the accusation and imprisonment of
this person are ever made public, we suppose that
the mystery of <i>the rose</i> will be explained, and the
probabilities ascertained of Mary Rogers having
visited Crommelin on the Sunday, after she cal-
led on Payne. From the first we have called at-
tention to this circumstance.—<i>N. Y. Herald</i>.

   M<small>URDER OF</small> M<small>ISS</small> R<small>OGERS</small>.—Archibald W. Pad-
ley, who had before made a voluntary statement to
the Police Magistrate, was brought up again on
Saturday, at the instance of Justice Parker, touch-
ing the murder of Miss Rogers, and on being yes-
terday examined, and nothing appearing to impli-
cate him in the remotest degree he was discharged.

	<b>The Case of Mary C. Rogers.</b>
   The Planet—a penny paper—of this morning
tells a strange story about this young lady. It as-
serts that a letter was received in this city yester-
day, from <u>Pittsburg</u>, the writer of which alleges
that he had just seen and conversed with Miss Ro-
gers there, in company with a Mr. Getchell, to
whom she was supposed to be married. That she
told him she had left New York clandestinely, be-
cause her mother urged her to marry a man she
did not like, and that she was going to an uncle in
Illinois. Farther that she had left a letter on the
table addressed to her mother, telling her of the
course she was about to take, &c.
   The Planet says that Mr. Crommelin, on seeing
the letter (the one from Pittsburgh,) set off imme-
diately for Illinois; and that Mrs. Rogers denies
having found any letter from Mary.
   This is a strange and improbable story; and
there is so much <u title="recklessness">recklesness</u>, in some of the pa-
pers, about making statements on doubtful authori-
ty, or none at all, no matter how grave the sub-
ject, that we cannot but hesitate in giving to it the
least particle of credence. If it were true some of
the other morning papers would, we think, have
had some notice of it.
   There is one circumstance, perhaps, that might
be cited in corroboration of the Pittsburgh letter,
which, from the first, has often caused us to doubt
as to her murder. Some two or three years ago,
while in attendance upon the segar-shop of Mr.
Anderson, Miss Rogers was abducted, or went in
to concealment that it might be believed she had
been abducted, in order to create excitement and
help the sale of the goods of her employer. After
<d>[Col.5]</d>
the smoking of the extra segars sold during the ex-
citement had cleared away, the young woman re-
turned as good as new.—<i>N. Y. Com. Adv.</i>

another, increasing the reward to $900 for the arrest
of Benjamin Lett, convicted a year since of setting

   T<small>HE</small> M<small>ARY</small> R<small>OGERS</small> M<small>YSTERY</small>.—It was currently
reported on Saturday, that the shawl and parasol be-
longing to this poor girl, had been discovered in a
tavern at Weehawken. One of the corps of inde-
fatigables immediately started to the place, but
what discoveries he made there, remains to be told.

   T<small>HE</small> T<small>WO</small> J<small>UDGES OF THE</small> S<small>ESSIONS</small>—N<small>OVEL</small> P<small>RO-
CEEDINGS</small>.—We stated the other day that Noah and
Lynch, the two Judges of the Sessions, had given
special instructions to the District Attorney to bring
several prosecutions against the members of the
Common Council, for giving negative votes in the
Board of Supervisors, on the salaries of these two
learned men. The following is an authentic copy of
this precious document:—
<m9>				“N<small>EW</small> Y<small>ORK</small>, Aug. 14, 1841.
“F<small>REDERICK</small> R. L<small>EE</small>, Esq.
	D<small>EAR</small> S<small>IR</small>:—
   “James Lynch, Esq., one of the Associate Judges of
the Court of Sessions has entered a complaint against
you for refusing to vote in favor of paying his bill for
salary as such Judge, at a meeting of the Board of Su-
pervisors, held in this city on the 9th of July last.
   “The statute imposes a penalty of $250 on every super-
visor who shall 'neglect or refuse to perform any of the
duties which shall be required of him by that law.'
1 R. S. 361.
   “By the act of Sessions Laws, 1831, 64 session, p. 26,
sec. 4 the Legislature says the salary of those Judges
shall be a county charge, and the supervisors 'shall au-
dit and allow the account for such arrears and on or be-
fore the 10th day of July.' The Statute, also 1 R. S. p.
375, sec. 102, makes it my duty to prosecute for the
penalty.
   “Your early attention is called to this matter, and as I
suppose the complaint to be made with no disposition
other than to enforce the payment of the salary claimed,
you will please inform me by an early day whether any
measures will be taken to audit the accounts which will
be satisfactory to the Judge.
			Respectfully yours,
						J. R. WHITING.”</m9>
   In addition to the penalty of $250, the District At-
torney can also procure indictments for misdemean-
ors against each of the refractory Aldermen, for
their negative votes—and one committee can punish
these gentlemen each in a fine of $500 or imprison-
ment, probably at Blackwell's Island, for six <u title="calender">calan-
der</u> months each.
   When Judge Lynch illustrated the law of <i>habeas
corpus</i> by his repeated decisions of that ancient writ,
every body thought he was a wonderfully learned
functionary—but the series of proceedings now be-
gun surpasses the whole history of law or cock-
fighting, from the time of Cain and Abel to the pre-
sent age. It would seem that Judge Lynch takes
the responsibility on himself, without the helping
hand of his brother in tribulation, Judge Noah—but
we know the character of the latter too well to <u title="imagine">ima-
jine</u> that this movement did not originate in his fer-
tile mind, and now receives his ready concurrence.
   This affair is the funniest thing that ever took
place in the criminal affairs of New York, and has
the same character of good natured absurdity which
have recently distinguished the long rigmarole arti-
cles on city affairs, published in the “Evening Star,”
on which Judge Noah has yet a mortgage of $7000,
and therefore controls its columns. As a practical
joke it beats any thing in Joe Miller, and we hope it
will be carried out, to the very digging of stone on
Blackwell's Isle.
   We, therefore, beg the Recorder to take up the
subject himself in his charge to the Grand Jury,
which meets to-day, on the opening of the Court of
Sessions. This is too rich a movement to hand over
to Lynch and Noah. The indictment of nine or ten
locofoco aldermen, for presuming to vote against the
salaries of Lynch and Noah, is a very important
matter—and ought to form the staple of his charge.
Go ahead. Ten aldermen on Blackwell's Island
getting out stone—instead of oysters and <u title="champagne">champaigne</u>
—what a rich sight!</f>

			POLICE—Yesterday.
   <i>The case of Mary C. Rogers</i>.—The spot at which
this unfortunate girl lost her life, is believed to have
been discovered. A little boy living at Weehawken
brought some days since to his mother, a hat tassel
which he found in the woods or bushes in the neigh-
borhood, and some other articles of female apparel.
Information of this having reached the Mayor, he vi-
sited the mother, was shown by the boy to the place,
and there found other pieces of her clothes and indi-
cations around of a violent struggle having taken
place. In consequence of this discovery, the follow-
ing notice has been issued by the Mayor, to which
we invite public attention. We would further sug-
gest that the Governor should, in addition to the pe-
cuniary reward offered for the discovery of the perpe-
trators of this atrocious act, promise a pardon to any
informer, who though present, was not actually a
party to it.

   The Mayor desires to see all persons of either sex
who were on Sunday afternoon, 25th of July last,
along the embankment at Weehawken, New Jersey,
or at the public house at the end of the embank-
ment. They will please call on him at the Mayor's

   Resolutions—To have a reward offered for the de-

man Benson opposed this, on the ground that the
Mayor had power to offer a reward to that amount.
He had not as yet seen fit to do so; and to author-
ise it now, would be charging him with remissness,
whereas it was well known he had made every effort
to discover the murderers. The resolution was lost
by a vote of 6 to 10.

C<small>HARGE TO THE</small> G<small>RAND</small> J<small>URY</small>.—We are happy to
perceive that Recorder Tallmadge has brought the
present condition of the police system to the notice
of the Grand Jury. There is some more sense indi-
cated in this movement, than we could find in the
charges of Lynch or Noah.
   The police system of this city requires a full in-
vestigation—and a complete reform. The same
may be said of the fire department, which seems to
be in a state of insurrection all the time. In these
important municipal systems, no change has taken
place since the population of New York numbered
10,000 or 20,000 inhabitants. Having now a popu-
lation of nearly <i>half a million</i>, it is utterly impossible
that the peace of the city can be maintained, or
crime prevented, under the present system. We
trust the Grand Jury will suit the matter thoroughly.
The Recorder may now to dinner.

move.

is named Governor and Judge of Israel. The Mili-

   C<small>ITY OF</small> R<small>EFUGE</small>.
   It was known at the sale of that beautiful and
valuable tract called Grand Island, a few miles be-
low this port, in the Niagara River, that it was pur-
chased, in part, by the friends of Mayor Noah, of
New York, [Jacob Barker, William Leggett, and
other large financiers of that day] avowedly to offer
it as an asylum for his brethren of the Jewish per-
suasion, who in the other parts of the world are
much oppressed; and it was likewise known that it
was intended to erect upon the Island a city called
Ararat. We are gratified to perceive, by the docu-
ments in this day's Extra, that, coupled with that
<u title="colonization (in Eve.Post)">colinization</u>, is a declaration of independence, and
the revival of the Jewish Government, under the
protection of the United Sates, after the disper-
sion of that ancient and wealthy people, for nearly
two thousand years, and the appointment of Mr. M.
M. Noah as first Judge. It was intended, pursuant
to public notice, to celebrate the event on the Island,
and a flag-staff was erected for the Grand Standard
of Israel, and other arrangements made; but it was
discovered that a sufficient number of boats could
not be procured in time to convey all those to the
Island who were desirous of witnessing the ceremo-
ny, and the celebration took place this day in the
village, which was both interesting and impressive.
At dawn of day, a salute was fired in front of the
Court House, and from the terrace facing the Lake.
At 10 o'clock the masonic and military companies
assembled in front of the Lodge, and at eleven the
line of procession was formed as follows:

<m9>   O<small>RDER OF</small> C<small>ELEBRATION</small>.—Music, military, citizens,
civil officers, State officers in uniform, U. S. officers, Pre-
sident and Trustees of the Corporation, tyler, stewards,
entered apprentices, fellow crafts, master masons, seni-
or and junior deacons, secretary and treasurer, senior
and junior wardens, master of lodges, past masters, reve-
rend clergy, stewards with corn, wine and oil.

Bible, square and compass, borne by a master mason, the
Judge of Israel in black, wearing the judicial robes of
crimsoned silk, trimmed with ermine, and a richly em-
bossed golden medal, suspended from the neck; [it was
a tragedy dress borrowed of the Park Theatre;] a master
mason, royal arch masons, knight templars.</m9>

   On arriving at the church door, the troops opened
to the right and left, and the procession entered the
aisles, the band playing the grand march from Ju-
das <u title="Maccabeus (in Eve.Post)">Maccabees</u>. The full toned organ commenced
its swelling notes, performing the Jubilate. On the
communion table lay the Corner Stone, with the
following inscription, in Hebrew:
<m9><span style="border:dotted .4em;display:inline-block;padding:.2em">   “Hear, O, Israel, the Lord is our God.—The Lord is
one.” Ararat, the Hebrew refuge, founded by Mordecai
Manuel Noah, in the month of Tisri, <u title="5586 ?">5585</u>, corresponding
with September, 1825, and in the 50th year of American
Independence.</span></m9>
On the stone lay the silver cups with wine, corn and
oil. The ceremonies commenced by the morning
service, read emphatically by the Rev. Mr. Searl, of
the Episcopal Church. “Before Jehovah's awful
Throne,” was sung by the choir to the tune of Old
Hundred. Morning prayer—first lesson from Jere-
miah, 31st. Second lesson, <u title="Zeph. (in Eve.Post)">Zep.</u> iii., 8th verse.—

   The following is the proclamation, which will be
read with great attention and interest. A finer day
and more general satisfaction, has not been known
on any similar occasion.
		P<small>ROCLAMATION TO THE</small> J<small>EWS</small>.
   Whereas, it has pleased Almighty God, to manifest to
his chosen people the approach of that period when, in
fulfilment of the promises made to the race of Jacob,
	...
Therefore, I, Mordecai Manuel Noah, citizen of the
United States of America, late consul of the said States
for the city and kingdom of Tunis, High Sheriff of New
York, Counsellor-at-Law, and by the Grace of God, Go-
vernor and Judge of Israel, have issued this my procla-
mation,
   Announcing to the Jews throughout the world, that an
asylum is prepared and hereby offered to them, where
they can enjoy that peace, comfort and happiness, which
has been denied them, through the intolerance and mis-
government of former ages; an asylum in a free and
powerful country, where ample protection is secured
<u title="to their (in Eve.Post)">their</u> persons, their property, and religious rights; an
asylum in a country remarkable for its vast resources,
the richness of its soil, and the salubrity of its climate;
where industry is encouraged, education promoted, and
good faith rewarded; “a land of milk and honey,” where
Israel may repose in peace, under his “vine and fig tree,”
and where our people may so familiarize themselves
with the science of government, and the lights of learning
and civilization, as may qualify them for that great and
final restoration to their ancient heritage which the
times so powerfully indicate.
   The asylum referred to is in the State of New York,
the greatest State in the American confederacy. New
York contains 43,214 square miles, divided into fifty-five
counties, and having six hundred and eighty seven port
towns and cities, containing one million five hundred
thousand inhabitants, together with six million acres of
	...
   The desired spot in the State of New York, to which I
hereby invite my beloved people throughout the world,
in common with those of every religious denomination,
is called Grand Island, and on which I shall lay the foun-
dation of a City of Refuge, to be called Ararat. Grand
Island, in the Niagara river, is bounded by Ontario on
the north; and Erie on the south, and within a few miles
of each of those great commercial lakes. The island is</m9>
<d>[Col.3]</d>
<m9>nearly twelve miles in length, and varying from three to
seven miles in breadth, and contains upwards of seven-
teen thousand acres of remarkably rich and fertile land.
	...
   Deprived as our people have been for centuries of a
right in the soil, they will learn with peculiar satisfac-
tion, that here they can till the land, reap the harvest,
and raise the flocks which are unquestionably their
own; and in the full unmolested enjoyment of their
religious rights, and of every civil immunity, together
with peace and plenty, they can lift up their voice in
gratitude to Him, who sustained our fathers in the wil-
derness, and brought us in triumph out of the land of
Egypt; who assigned to us the safe keeping of his ora-
cles; who proclaimed us his people, and who has ever
walked before us “like a cloud by day and pillar of fire
by night.”
   In His name do I revive, renew and re-establish the
government of the Jewish nation, under the auspices
and protection of the constitution and laws of the United
States of America, confirming and perpetuating all our
rights and privileges, our name, our rank, and our
power, among the nations of the earth as they existed
and were recognized under the government of the
Judges. And I hereby enjoin it upon all our pious and
venerable <u title="As in Eve.Post">rabbi's</u>, our presidents and elders of syna-
gogues, chiefs of colleges, and brethren in authority
throughout the world, to circulate and make known this
my proclamation, and to give to it full publicity, credence,
and effect.
   It is my will that a census of the Jews throughout the
world be taken, and returns of persons, together with
their age and occupation, be registered in the archives of
the synagogues where they are accustomed to worship,
	...
   I command that a strict neutrality be observed in the
pending war between the Greeks and Turks, enjoined
by consideration of safety towards a numerous popula-
tion of Jews now under the oppressive dominion of the
<u title="Ottoman (in Eve.Post)">Ottomon</u> Porte.
	...
   I abolish forever Polygamy among the Jews, which,
without religious warrant, still exists in Asia and Africa.
	...
   A capitation tax of three shekels in silver per annum,
or one Spanish dollar, is hereby levied upon each Jew
throughout the world, to be collected by the treasurers
of the different congregations, for the purpose of defraying
the various expenses of re-organizing the government, of
aiding emigrants in the purchase of agricultural instru-
ments, providing for their immediate wants and comforts,
	...
glory of the Jewish nation. A Judge of Israel shall be
chosen once in every four years by the Consistory at
Paris, at which time proxies from every congregation
shall be received.
   I do hereby name as commissioners, the most learned
and pious Abraham de Cologna, Knight of the Iron
Crown of Lombardy, Grand Rabbi of the Jews, and
President of the Consistory of Paris, like the Grand
Rabbi Andrade of Bordeaux, and also our estimable
Grand Rabbis of the German and Portugal Jews, in Lon-
don, Rabbis Herschell and Mendoza, together with the
	...
   I do appoint Roshodes Adar, Feb.7, 1826, to be observed
with suitable demonstrations, as a day of thanksgiving
to the Lord God of Israel, for the manifold blessings and
	...
   Given at Buffalo, in the State of New York, this <u title="third ?">second</u>
day of Tisri, in the year of the world, 5586, correspond-
ing with the 15th day of <u title="September">Sestember</u>, 1825, and in the fif-
tieth year of American Independence.
			By the Judge,
						<u title="Absent in Eve.Post">M. M. NOAH,</u>
   A. B. S<small>EIXAS</small>, Secretary <i>pro tem</i>.</m9>

   This religious revelation, so well arranged, did not
succeed at the time, because it was rather too early
in the field, and because the Jews are a stiff-necked
people, and want faith. But if Mr. Noah had per-
sisted in his purpose—exhibited the enthusiasm and
devotion of Jo Smith—of Margaret Bishop—we have
not the slightest doubt but he would become a much
better prophet and Judge in <u title="Israel">Isreal</u>, than a political
editor, or a Christian Judge. Every great genius
in religious movements must possess unbounded
faith in himself—irrepressible enthusiasm in his pur-
suit—and great energy in effort. Mr. Noah was too
soon discouraged, and accordingly Jo Smith, with
less general knowledge, but more moral courage,
started on a like plan, a few years afterwards, in
Canandaigua, and originated the great Mormon
movement, which bids fair to be the most prosperous
that ever arose toward the setting of the sun. But
there is no reason why the Book of <u title="Jasher ?">Jashar</u> should
not beat the Book of <u title="Mormon ?">Morman</u> out of the field, and in
the movement recently made in Philadelphia, by a
new religious union, among the ancient people of
God, we trust that the Hebrews of this city will ap-
point Mr. Noah their delegate, and thus give him an
opportunity to overtake the great Mormon prophet,
or at least catch up to the apron strings of Margaret
Bishop, and hold on fast during the race for immor-
tality.
   We desire all our religious, as well as irreli-
gious readers, to watch and pray. In the present
agitated state of the moral, financial, and political
world, we may expect some new and profound re-
<d>[Col.4]</d>
velation, that may set this wicked world once more
on its legs. We want an earthquake, a tornado, a
volcanic eruption, or some terrible commotion of
the moral, religious and social elements, to set all
things to right again.

of Mary Rogers, we have received the following no-
tice from the Police:—
<m9>				P<small>OLICE</small> O<small>FFICE</small>, <i>Sept.</i> 5<i>th</i>, 1841.
   S<small>IR</small>: I am requested by the magistrate of the Lower

thing relative to the murder of Mary C. Rogers, for the
present. The reason will be given to your reporter to-

   Most certainly we will, although we know all the
horrible facts which have recently been discovered,
by, as it were, the interposition of Providence—facts
which will lead to the certain discovery of the per-
petrators of that horrid butchery. The evidence
and inferences of the eminent physician of Hoboken,
Dr. Cook, are all confirmed beyond the possibility of
a doubt. When we are permitted, we will lift the
veil, and show scenes of blood and brutality, that
will make the hair stand on end. The precise lo-
cality of the violation and murder is now known—
and her beastly murderers cannot escape. A young
boy of Weehawken, in wandering through a thicket
one day last week, came upon a spot where a wo-
man's petticoat, parasol, pieces of her dress, and poc-
ket handkerchief were found. It was in the centre of
a thick grove, a short distance from the river. He
gave notice of the facts to his mother—the mother
to the coroner or justice of Hoboken. On Saturday
and Sunday last, the Mayor and District Attorney,
in company with Doctor Cook and others, examined
the ground. They found three pieces of dress
which had belonged to Mary, besides other evidences
of murder—traces of blood—and the rails of the
fences, down to the water's edge, had been re-
moved or broken down, so as to take the body, when
the poor girl was dead, to the river.
   Other facts are known of equal importance, but it
is now beyond a doubt that Mary Rogers was forced
across the river in a boat, and violated and murder-
ed by the crew of that boat. Let the Police move.
The Mayor has issued the following:—
<m9>			<b>Advertisement.</b>
   ☞ The M<small>AYOR</small> desires to see all persons of either sex

last meeting were read and approved.
	...
   A communication was received from an individual,
asking for the office of “Reporter of Aliens.” Referred
to Committee on Applications to Office.
   <i>Resolutions</i>.—Whereas great excitement has been crea-
ted in this city, in consequence of the outrage and mur-
der of Mary C. Rogers; therefore, a reward, at the dis-
cretion of the Mayor, be offered for the apprehension of
the murderer or murderers.
   Alderman <u>Baylis</u> moved to fill the blank with $1000.
   Alderman Purdy thought it was too large a sum, con-
sidering that a committee of citizens had offered a re-
ward of $600, which, with the sum offered by the Gov-
ernor, now made the reward $1,350.
   Alderman Woodhull said the Mayor was opposed to
the object of this resolution. His Honor was now in
communication with the Governor of New Jersey, on
the subject of the outrage, and with great hopes of effect-
ing some discoveries.
   Alderman Kimball was willing to leave the matter to
the discretion of his Honor the Mayor.
   Alderman Purdy thought a reasonable reward should
be offered, and therefore moved to make the reward
$500.
   Alderman Benson thought it was indirect censure on
his Honor the Mayor, who had been most active in his
attempts to ferret out the guilty. His Honor had now
the power to offer $500, if he thought it expedient so
to do.
   The question was taken on the passage of the <u title="resolution ?">re-
solutions</u>, and lost, six voting in the affirmative, and
ten in the negative.

of the person or persons guilty of the violation of the
person and murder of Mary C. Rogers—which was reject-

   THE CASE OF MISS ROGERS.
   The Planet—a penny paper—of this
morning tells a strange story about this
young lady. It asserts that a letter was
received in this city yesterday, from
Pittsburgh, the writer of which alleges
that he had just seen and conversed with
Miss Rogers there, in company with a
Mr. Getchell, to whom she was supposed
to be married. That she told him she
had left New York clandestinely, be-
cause her mother urged her to marry a
man she did not like, and that she was
going to an uncle in Illinois. Farther
that she had left a letter on the table
addressed to her mother, telling her of
the course she was about to take, &c.
   The Planet says that Mr. Crommelin,
on seeing the letter (the one from Pitts-
burgh,) set off immediately for Illinois;
and Mrs. Rogers denies having found
any letter from Mary.
   This is a strange and improbable sto-
ry; and there is so much recklessness,
in some of the papers, about making
statements on doubtful authority, or none
at all, no matter how grave the subject,
that we cannot but hesitate in giving to
it the least particle of credence. If it
were true some of the other morning pa-
pers would, we think, have had some
notice of it.
   We may as well add here that the
Tattler has, within the last few days,
argued at length in support of the hy-
pothesis that the body found in the river
was not the body of Miss Rogers. We
can discover little or no force in its rea-
sonings.
   The identification of the clothing worn
by Miss Rogers with that found on the
body was, and still is considered perfect
and conclusive.
   Perhaps the strongest argument a-
gainst the conclusion of the Tattler is
the fact that no other young woman but
Miss Rogers has disappeared in an un-
accountable manner.
   There is one circumstance, perhaps,
that might be cited in corroboration of
the Pittsburgh letter, which, from the
first, has often caused us to doubt as to
her murder. Some two or three years
ago, while in attendance upon the segar
shop of Mr. Anderson, Miss Rogers was
abducted, or went in to concealment, that
it might be believed she had been ab-
ducted, in order to create excitement
and help the sale of the goods of her em-
ployer. After the smoke of the extra
segars sold during the excitement had
cleared away, the young woman return-
ed as good as new.—<i>N. Y. Com. Adv.</i>

   <i>Another Arrest for the Murder of Miss Rog-
ers</i>.—A person by the name of A. W. Padley,
was arrested in New York on Monday, charg-
ed with abduction, rape and murder of Mary
C. Rogers. The New York Tattler says:—
   Mr. Padley is the man who testified to see-
ing the rose in Mr. Crommelin's door, and the
name of Mary on Mr. Crommelin's slate. He
professed to identify the body and to corrob-
orate all Mr. Crommelin's statements. He is
the person who testifies to the last trace of
Mary. His silence since the affair <i>seemed</i> to
have been settled, is a strong circumstance
against him.
   The Grand Jury, who meet next week, will
unquestionably act upon the matter; and when
the trial or examination of Mr. Padley comes
up, Mr. Crommelin will have a chance for show-
ing the character of his connexion, as a wit-
ness in the case. Let us have no more star-
chamber work.
   We trust that the public are now satisfied
that Venetian police examinations amount to
nothing. We hope that Mr. Justice Taylor
will be cited, as a witness, to say what result-
ed from his examination of Mrs. Rogers at her
house. We expect also to find out, whether
Mrs. Rogers ever saw any part of the clothing,
said to be Mary's, except what was carried to
her by Mr. Crommelin, on the morning after
the discovery.

pose that with the abundance of food for excite-
ment which prevails at present, the “rumor” mon-
gers might get along without turning aside as of-
ten as once a month to frighten our poor old
grand-mothers with a fresh declaration of war
against McLeod. Can they not find enough to sa-
tisfy their greedy appetites for the marvellous in
the steamboat burnings, the powder explosions,
the murder of Mary <u>Rodgers</u>, the fights of the
firemen, the hubbub at Washington, the vetoes,
debates, denunciations, burnings in effigy, break-
ing up of old cabinets and forming new ones, the
intrigues, “plots and counter-plots” that are in
progress?
	...
   In the midst of all these signs and wonders,
both in heaven and on earth, we can only pray
that the nerves of our good old grand-mothers
may be strengthened not only to hear these terri-
ble tidings, but to look calmly on the catastrophe
that is to follow. We have not the least doubt
that America will be invaded by thousands of
Britons in less than six months. But let us not
be alarmed. They will only come to help culti-
vate our fields and eat their bread in peace where
no barbarous corn laws will grasp one half of
each loaf from their hungry mouths.

   A<small>RREST OF</small> L<small>ETT</small>.—The Buffalo papers bring in-
formation of the arrest of Lett, the incendiary, for
whom Governor Seward has recently offered a large
reward. He was taken in Buffalo, by Constables
Gates, Pierce, Smith, Best and <u title="Bottum, Burton (elsewhere)">Bottom</u>, on board of
the steamboat Daniel Webster. When accosted by
the police, he made an attempt to escape, by draw-
ing his knife and threatening to kill the first man
who dared to approach him, but he was speedily dis-
armed and ironed. This Lett, it will be recollect-
ed, was tried in June, 1840, at Oswego, for an at-
tempt to set fire to the steamboat Great Britain,
when she was filled with passengers on one of her
usual trips. He was convicted on the clearest tes-
timony and sentenced to imprisonment in the state
prison, and while on his way there, under charge
of the deputy sheriff, escaped from the car in which
he was conveyed. He has since been at large not-
withstanding the efforts made to retake him.

   S<small>COUNDRELISM</small>.—Some scoundrel placed two logs
of timber across the track of New Jersey Rail-

disaster. The mail train from Philadelphia, which
was full of passengers, was going fortunately with no
great speed when they struck against the logs; and
the engineer having immediately chocked his engine,
succeeded in preventing the train from being thrown
off the track. The cow-fender in front, though fas-
tened down with an iron bolt, was raised up by the
violence of the blow, the timber being forced un-
der it.

		CAPTURE OF LETT.
   I have the satisfaction of informing you that the
desperate Lett was this morning captured in this city
by constables Gates, Pierce, Smith, Best and <u title="Bottom, Burton (elsewhere)">Bottum</u>,
and is now safely lodged in jail. Information was last
night communicated to Gates, that he was seen to go on
board the Daniel Webster, one of the steamboats laid
up, and which is moored some distance up the creek.—
Arrangements were concerted by the police to meet at
the boat at the same time from different ways, when
they made a rush into the cabin, where they found him
quietly eating his breakfast with a man named Hinton,
keeper of the boat. He immediately ran to a state
room, seized his bowie knife, and threatened death to
the first man who laid hands upon him. One of the con-
stables quietly told him that they had come to take him,
and take him they should, either dead or alive. While
one was in the act of seizing him, he made a pass with
his knife, but his arm was arrested by the others; when
he was disarmed, ironed, and safely secured.<f>
   The bodies of the unfortunate sufferers by the Erie
continue to come in—over 100 have been recovered.—

<m9>		Correspondence of the Tribune.
Extract of a letter to the Editors, dated B<small>UFFALO</small>, Sept. 6, 1841.</m9>
   <i>Gentlemen</i>: The notorious <i>Lett</i>, concerning whom you
have heard so much, and for whose apprehension the Gov-
ernor recently offered a considerable reward, was apprehen-
ded in this city this morning, and is now secure in our jail
He was taken on board of one of the steamboats that is laid
up in the harbor. It was ascertained, some time since, that
Lett was occasionally in this city, on his way between the
Eastern and Western frontiers; and a watch was therefore
kept for him. On this occasion it is said he had just arrived
from Lewiston, and at the moment of his capture was seated
at breakfast, with the keeper of the boat. There were five
or six concerned in the capture, which was the result of a
surprise that they had planned, and executed without concert
with any one else. They had arranged and timed their
movements so as to approach the steamboat from different
points, and to arrive upon her deck at the same instant.
Lett, on seeing them, sprang for his weapons, but seeing so
many upon him, and being told that resistance could avail
him nothing, he submitted to be ironed.<f>
   Within the last three days great number of the bodies of
the victims of the late steamboat Erie have been brought to

			<b>Lett in the State Prison.</b>
	Correspondence of the Tribune.
					A<small>UBURN</small>, Sept. 7, 1841.
   <i>Dear Sir</i>: <u title="Benjamin (elsewhere)">Alexander</u> Lett, of Canadian notoriety, was
this day consigned to a place within the walls of the State
Prison in this place. You may remember he was convicted
in Oswego a year ago last June for an attempt to blow up
one of the steamboats in Oswego harbor as she was about
leaving the wharf, and sentenced to the Auburn State Prison
for seven years. On his way here, when within three miles,
he jumped from the cars (during the night) and escaped.—
He has been wandering about in this State and Canada from
that time to this.
   On Sunday he crossed from Waterloo to Buffalo and was
secreted in the steamboat Daniel Webster. These facts
were made known to the authorities at Buffalo, and five Con-
stables on Monday came on him so suddenly while he was
in the lady's cabin, that he was not able to seize upon any of
his arms, consisting of a seven-shooter, pistols, dirks, &c.;
he was immediately lodged in jail, and within two hours
was on his way here. He had hopes of escaping on his
way, till he arrived within sight of Auburn, when he gave up.
He will now do the State some service in making silk. He
is well capacitated to be the leader of a desperate set of
men—not over five feet ten but every inch a man. A wild and
desperate eye, an expansive forehead, but thin face, high
cheek bones, with a head covered with fiery red hair, sur-
mounted upon a long neck well supported by a powerful
chest, and shoulders. He was betrayed by some of his as-
sociates. The large reward offered by the Governor and
Sheriff of Oswego was too tempting. Their patriotism gave
way at the sight of the glittering bait; the Governor visited
the prison this afternoon and conversed with him as to his
design, &c.			Yours, &c.				M.

		CAPTURE OF LETT.
   It gives us great pleasure to announce the capture
of this notorious villain, and we not only hope that
proper care will be taken to keep him in custody
now that he is once more in the hands of the law,
but that measures will be taken to add such punish-
ment as is called for by his last act of violence.—
Seven years imprisonment is a very inadequate mea-
sure of punishment for such a wretch. Seven years
more for the attempt to murder the officers will be
none too heavy a retribution. The following parti-
culars of his arrest are from the Buffalo Commer-
cial Advertiser of Monday last:
   “This desperado was captured this morning, and
is safely lodged in jail. The police learned that he
was lurking about the city, and last night constable
Gates got upon his track, and saw him go on board
the Webster, one of the steamboats laid up. A plan
of operations was immediately concerned, and this
morning constables Gates, Pierce, Smith, Best and
<u title="Bottum, Bottom (elsewhere)">Burton</u> carried it into execution. They divided into
two parties, met on the boat precisely at the minute
fixed upon, and made a rush into the ladies cabin,
where Lett, in company with a man named Hinton,
the keeper of the boat, was quietly seated eating his
breakfast. He ran into an adjoining state room,
seized a Bowie knife, and threatened with death the
first man who approached him. The constables told
him resistance was useless, they had come to take
him, dead or alive, and would. One seized his arm
as he was making a blow, the others sprang upon
and disarmed him, the handcuffs were put on, and
in spite of all his resistance, he was forthwith lodg-
ed in jail, and the Sheriff's certificate of <u title="deposit">deposite</u>
taken.”
   P. S. We have since received the Auburn Journal,
by which paper we learn that Lett has been duly de-
posited in the State Prison, and there, in our opinion,
he ought to remain at hard labor during the remain-
der of his life, unless it should be deemed in the mean
time that he better deserves hanging.

   T<small>HE</small> P<small>ENNY</small> P<small>RESS</small>.—A new penny paper has been
just started under this name, which bids fair from the
talents displayed—the size of the sheet—and the
enterprise with which it is conducted, to take the
wind out of its older and less energetic rivals.
	...
   In this city the “Sun” has been the leading penny
paper, principally because it was the first, and be-
cause its rivals wanted talents and enterprise to con-
tend with it successfully. Within a few months a
great change has been going on in the stability and
circulation of the Sun, and it is now generally be-
lieved that the “Tribune,” a rival penny paper,
started by a <i>clique</i> of politicians, has made serious
inroads upon its prosperity and business. We have
heard the increase of the Tribune stated at 10,000
circulation, and the decrease of the Sun to be as
much—perchance more. It is difficult to ascertain
the accurate circulation of the “Sun” in the city,
because it is generally taken by the poorer classes—
and it is got up so cheaply, for it is principally made
up of stale news, a day or two old—that its proprie-
tor a very money making man, can get nearly as
much for his paper from the grocers to tie up tea
and sugar with, as he gets from his carriers to serve
their subscribers. The quantity of the Sun that may
be printed, and its actual business circulation, was
very many thousands. In this respect, the Tribune
differs. It is read and perused by those who take it
for its news and its opinions. These opinions are
corrupt and rotten—and spring from bank specula-
tors, office-beggars—but still they have their advo-
cates. The Tribune who generally gives the latest
news—a thing which is entirely neglected by the
Sun till the next day. This has given the Tribune
another advantage over the Sun.
   But both and all such papers would seem to be
destined to be superseded by the new “Penny Press”
which is large in size—conducted with great spirit—
not tinctured with party—beyond the reach of <i>cliques</i>
—and just such a penny paper as will merit the sup-
port of any intelligent community.

   I have just time to inform you, that the notorious
Lett, was arrested this morning about 10 A. M. on
<u title="board">boord</u> the steamer D. Webster, lying up the creek.
He was engaged playing cards, and intended to
go on some boat up the Lake after dark, as they all
start at eight o'clock. He was well armed, but no
less than four of our police were on to him before he
could defend himself. He is now safely lodged in the
jail here. As soon as the news from New York ar-
rived last evening, there was at least twenty specula-
tors started for the west, to take advantage of the
present rise of flour. The steamboats are daily
bringing in dead bodies of those who were lost in
the Erie. Time is up to close mail.

seven years' imprisonment. He is a man of indomi-

McKenzie in the contemplated rebellion, his Farm
was confiscated, and then his Brother was shot and
his Sister outraged by soldiery. This was enough to
make a man desperate. He determined to live
henceforth for revenge. After his escape from the
Rail Road Car on his way to prison, he returned to
Canada, where he blew up the Welland Canal and

he was arrested at Buffalo, he was in Canada, matur-

   <i>Case of Mary Rogers</i>.—The notification
from the Mayor's office which we published
yesterday, seems to indicate that something
has turned up to give the investigations of the
police what we hope will prove a successful
direction. The morning papers inform us
that within a few days the parasol of the
murdered girl has been found in a thicket at
Weehawken, together with portions of her
dress; and that in the immediate vicinity of
the place where these were found, there were
indications of violent struggle.
   Perhaps we may as well state now what
we alluded to some two or three weeks since
as a discovery which perhaps indicated the
spot where the murder was committed. A
party of gentlemen, in rowing along the
<d>[Col.6(x) / Col.1]</d>
Jersey shore, not far from the Weehawken
bluff, observed appearances on a tabular
rock, in a very secluded place, which they
took to be stains of blood; but as they
had ladies with them, in whom the discovery
might excite unpleasant feelings, they passed
on without remark. This was a day or two
after the murder.
   The next day they went to the spot, and
examined the rock carefully. Rain had fal-
len during the night, and the stains were less
distinct than they were on the previous day;
but the gentlemen in question had no doubt
that the surface of the rock had borne large
and numerous spots of blood, the traces of
which were yet visible. The place was very
lonely, and entirely screened from observa-
tion except to persons in a boat upon the
river.
   The discovery was made known to some
of the officials of the police office; but we
were surprised to learn from the Mayor,
whom we met at Rockaway the other day,
that it had not been communicated to him.
He first heard of it from us, and his surprise
and <u title="displeasure">displasure</u> at the <u title="concealment">conealment</u> were very
freely expressed.
   Whether there was any thing in it, of im-
portance we do not know.—<i>N. Y. Com.</i>

   In such wise does the official journal of this State,

who, actuated by a malice nothing less than diaboli-
cal, endeavored to destroy by fire the steamboat
<i>Great Britain</i>, then full of passengers,—of whom
many could not have failed to become victims, if the
attempt had been successful.
   He who embarks in rebellion knows before-hand
that he must do so with a halter round his neck; and
to seek to palliate acts of midnight murder and ar-
son, by the severities exercised towards a fugitive
conspirator, is to confound all sentiment of right and
wrong.
   Especially at such a juncture as the present, does
the lenient, not to say admiring, tone of the official

to us most misplaced.

   R<small>IOT AND</small> M<small>OBS</small>, C<small>ONFUSION AND</small> B<small>LOODSHED</small>.—
This city has been in the most alarming condition
for several days—and from about 8 o'clock on Fri-
day evening until about 3 o'clock yesterday morn-
ing, almost entirely at the mercy of a law-
less mob, ranging in number from two to three
hundred. Amidst the confusion of such a state of
things, it is almost impossible to collect a full or
accurate state of facts. But with deep regret, and
acknowledged humiliation, we detail what happen-
ed as well as we can.
   On Tuesday evening last, as we are informed, a
quarrel took place near the corner of Sixth street
and Broadway, between a party of Irishmen and
some negroes, in which blows were exchanged,
and other weapons, if not firearms, used. Some
two or three of such party were wounded. On
Wednesday night the quarrel was renewed in some
way, and sometime after midnight, a party of ex-
cited men, armed with clubs, &c., attacked a house
occupied as a negro boarding house on <u title="Macalester (in Hazard's Register)">McAlister</u>
street, demanding the surrender of a negro, who
they said had fled into the house, and was there
secreted, and uttering the most violent threats a-
gainst the house, and the negroes in general. Se-
veral of the adjoining houses were occupied by ne-
gro families, including a number of women and
children. The violence increased and was resist-
ed by those in and about the houses—and engage-
ment took place—several were wounded on each
side—and some say guns or pistols were discharged
from the house. The interference of some gentle-
men in the neighborhood, succeeded in restoring
quiet after about three-fourths of an hour, when a
watchman appeared. But it is singular that this
violent street disturbance, elicited no report to the
police, nor arrest—indeed that the Mayor remain-
ed ignorant of the affair, until late in the day, when
he casually heard of it.
   On Thursday night another rencontre took place
in the neighborhood of the Lower Market, between
some young men and boys, and some negroes, in
which one or two of the boys were badly wounded,
as was supposed, with knives—how the negroes
fared, we did not learn.
   On Friday, during the day, there was considera-
ble excitement; threats of violence and lawless
outbreaks were indicated in various ways, and came
to the ear of the police, and of the negroes. At-
tacks were expected upon the negro residents in
<u>MacAlister</u>, Sixth and New streets. The negroes
armed themselves, and the knowledge of this in-
creased the excitement. But we did not know that
it produce any known measure of precaution on
the part of the police, to preserve the peace of the
city.
   Before eight o'clock in the evening, a mob, the
principal organization of which, we understand,
was arranged in Kentucky, openly assembled in
Fifth street market, unmolested by the police or ci-
tizens. The number of this mob, as they delibe-
rately marched from their rendezvous towards
Broadway and Sixth streets, is variously estimated,
but the number increased as they proceeded. They
were armed with clubs, stones, &c. &c.
   Reaching the scene of operations with shouts and
blasphemous imprecations, they attacked a negro
confectionary house on Broadway, next to Syca-
more, and demolished the doors and windows.—
This attracted an immense crowd. Savage yells
were uttered to encourage the mob onward to the
general attack upon the negroes. About this time,
before 9 o'clock, J. W. <u title="Piatt (in Hazard's Register, and elsewhere)">Platt</u>, in a way highly cred-
itable to himself, addressed the mob, exhorting
them to peace, obedience to law, and to retire
without further violence. His voice was drowned
by the violent shouts of the mob, and the throwing
of stones. At this time, we verily believe, a de-
termined corps of fifty or one hundred men, would
have dispersed the crowd. The Mayor came up
and addressed the people, in a very proper way.—
The savage yell was instantly raised—“down with
him!”—“run him off”—were shouted and inter-
mixed with horrid <u title="imprecations and exhortations to (in Hazard's Register)">imprecations to</u> the mob to
move onward. We took some pains to ascertain
who these leading disturbers of the peace were, and
think a large portion of the leaders, and the most
violent, came from the other parts, were strangers
—some were said to be connected with river navi-
gation, and were strongly backed by boat hands of
the lowest and most violent order. They advan-
ced to the attack with stones, &c. &c., and were
repeatedly fired upon by the negroes. The mob
scattered, but immediately rallied again, and again
were in like manner repulsed. Men were wound-
ed on both sides, and carried off—and many re-
ported dead. The negroes rallied several times,
advanced upon the crowd, and most unjustifiably
fired down the street into it, causing a great rush
down the street.
   These things were repeated until past 1 o'clock,
when a party procured an iron six pounder from
near the river, loaded with boiler punchings, &c.,
and hauled it to the ground, against the exhorta-
tions of the Mayor and others. It was posted on
Broadway and pointed down Sixth street. The
yells continued, but there was a partial cessation of
the firing. Many of the negroes had fled to the
hills. The attack upon houses recommenced with
the firing of guns, on both sides, which continued
during most of the night—and exaggerated rumors
of the killed and wounded, filled the streets. The
cannon was discharged several times.
   About 2 o'clock, a portion of the military, upon
the call of the Mayor, proceeded to the scene of
disorder, and succeeded in keeping the mob at bay.
<d>[Col.4]</d>
In the morning and throughout the day, several
blocks, including the battle ground, were sur-
rounded by sentinels, and kept under martial law
—keeping within, the negroes there, and adding to
them such as were brought during the day, seized
without particular charge, by parties who scoured
the city, assuming the authority of the law.
   A meeting of citizens was held at the Court
House on Saturday morning, at which the Mayor
presided. This meeting was addressed by the
Mayor, Judge Read, Mr. <u>Platt</u>, Sheriff Avery, and
Mr. Hart. They resolved to observe the law, to
discountenance mobs, invoked the aid of the civil
authorities to stay the violence, and pledged them-
selves to exertion in aid of the civil authority to ar-
rest and place within reach of the law, the negroes
who wounded the two white boys on Columbia
street. That the Township Trustees enforce the
law of 1807, requiring security of negroes—pledg-
ing themselves to enforce it to the letter, until the
city “is relieved of the effects of modern abolition-
ism,” assuring “our Southern brethren,” to carry
out that “act in good faith”—and to deliver “up,
under the law of Congress, forthwith,” every negro
who escapes from his master and comes within <u title="our (in Hazard's)">the</u>
borders. They requested the Mayor, Sheriff, and
the civil authorities, to proceed at once to the
dwellings of the blacks, and disarm them of all of-
fensive weapons—and recommending search for
offenders against the laws, immediate legal pro-
ceedings against them, and an efficient patrol to
protect the persons and property of the blacks, du-
ring the existence of the present excitement, and
until they give the bonds required by the act of
1807 or leave the city. They requested the parents
and guardians of the boys to keep them at home, or
away from the scene of excitement. They “<i>Re-
solved</i>, That we view with abhorrence the pro-
ceedings of the Abolitionists in our city, and that
we repudiate their doctrines, and believe it to be
the duty of every good citizen by all lawful means
to discountenance every man who lends them his
assistance.” These resolutions were reported by
a committee composed by Messrs. J. W. <u>Platt</u>, J.
C. Avery, R. A. Madison, J. C. Vaughan, B. Sto-
rer, D. T. Disney, J. Read, J. Goodin, and N. W.
Thomas. They were adopted unanimously, signed
by the Mayor of the city, Col. Davies, as President
of the meeting, and Edward Woodruff, the Presi-
dent of the City Council, as their Secretary, print-
ed in handbills, and posted in all parts of the city.
   The City Council also held a special session,
and passed resolutions invoking the united exer-
tions of orderly citizens to the aid of the authori-
ties—to put down the violent commotion existing
in the city, to preserve order and vindicate the law
against the violence of an excited and lawless
mob—requesting all officers, watchmen, and fire-
men to unite for the arrest of all rioters and viola-
tors of law, and the Marshal to increase his depu-
ties to any number required, not exceeding five
hundred, to preserve life and protect property—re-
quiring the Mayor and Marshal to call in the aid of
the county militia to preserve order, and the Cap-
tain of the Watch to increase his force. These
proceedings were posted in handbills. Intense ex-
citement continued during the day, the mob and
their leaders boldly occupying the streets without
arrest, or any effort to arrest any of them that we
have heard of.
   The negroes held a meeting in a church, and
respectfully assured the Mayor and the citizens
that they would use every effort to conduct as or-
derly, industrious, and peaceable people, and to
suppress any imprudent conduct among their popu-
lation, and to ferret out all violators of order and
law—deprecated the practice of carrying about
their persons any dangerous weapon, pledged
themselves not to carry or keep any about their
persons or houses, and expressed their readiness to
surrender all such. They expressed their readi-
ness to conform to the law of 1807, and give bonds
or to leave within a specified time—and tendered
their thanks to the Mayor, watch officers, and gen-
tlemen of the city, for the efforts made to save
their property, their lives, their wives and chil-
dren.
   At 3 P. M. the Mayor, Sheriff, Marshal, and a
<u title="portion">porion</u> of the police, proceeded to the battle
ground, and there, under the protection of the mili-
tary, though in the presence of the mob, and so far
controlled by them, as to prevent the taking away
of any negroes, upon their complying with the
law, several negroes gave bond and obtained the
permission of the authorities to go away with sure-
ties, some of our most respectable citizens, but
were headed even within the military sentinels and
compelled to return within the ground. It was re-
solved to embody the male negroes, and march
them to jail for security, under protection of mili-
tary and civil authority. From 250 to 300 negroes,
including sound and maimed, were with some dif-
ficulty marched off to the jail, surrounded by the
military and officers, and a dense mass of men, wo-
men, and boys, confounding all distinction between
the orderly and disorderly, accompanied by deafen-
ing yells. They were safely lodged, and still re-
main in prison, separated from their families. The
crowd was in that way dispersed.
   Some then supposed we should have a quiet night
—but others more observing, discovered that the
lawless mob had determined on further violence, to
be enacted immediately after night fall. Citizens
disposed to aid the authorities were invited to as-
semble, enroll themselves, and organize for action.
The military were ordered out, and firemen were
out, clothed with authority as a police band. A-
bout 80 citizens enrolled themselves as assistants
of the Marshal, and acted during the night under
his directions, in connection with <u title="Judge (in Hazard's)">Sudge</u> Torrence,
who was selected by themselves. A portion of
force was mounted. A troop of horse, and several
companies of volunteer infantry continued on duty
until near midnight. Some were then discharged
to sleep upon their arms. Others remained on
duty till morning, guarding the jail, &c.
   As was anticipated, the mob, efficiently organ-
ized, early commenced operations, dividing their
force and making attacks at different points, thus
distracting the attention of the police. The first
successful onset was made upon the printing estab-
lishment of the Philanthropist. They succeeded
in entering the establishment, breaking up the
press, and running with it, amidst savage yells,
down through Main street to the river, into which
it was thrown. The military appeared in the alley
near the office, interrupting the mob for a short
time. They escaped through the by ways, and
when the military retired, returned to their work
of destruction in the office, which they completed.
Several houses were broken open in different parts
of the city, occupied by negroes, and the windows,
doors and furniture, totally destroyed. Among
such is the confectionary establishment of Burnet
near the upper market—a shop on Columbia, near
Sycamore—the negro church on 6th street, and
four or five houses near it—a small frame house
near the synagogue on Broadway, and several
houses on Western row near the river. One of their
last efforts was to fire or otherwise destroy the book
establishment of Messrs. Truman & Smith, on
Main street. From this they were driven by the
police, and soon after, before daylight, dispersed
from mere exhaustion, whether to remain quiet or
to recruit their strength for renewed assault, we
may know before this paper is circulated.
   Mortifying as is the declaration, truth requires us
to acknowledge, that our good city has been in
complete anarchy, controlled mostly by a lawless
and violent mob for twenty-four hours, trampling
all law and authority under foot. We feel this de-
gradation deeply—but so it is. It is impossible to
learn the precise number killed and wounded, ei-
ther of whites or among the negroes, probably sev-
eral were killed on both sides, and some twenty or
thirty variously wounded, though but few danger-
ously. Several of the citizen police were hurt with
stones and brick bats, which were thrown into the
crowd by the mob. The authorities succeeded in
arresting and securing about forty of the mob, who
are now in prison—others were arrested, but were
rescued or made their escape otherwise. We have
attempted a plain general narrative of these dis-
graceful <u title="proceedings">procedings</u>—have endeavored to be accu-
rate in our facts, and to narrate them in their order
of occurrence without coloring or distortion. Such
a narrative, at this time, we thought necessary to
check the exaggerated rumors which have doubtless
spread in all directions. Many of these transac-
tions occurred under our own observation, during
Friday night, and the evening and night of Satur-
day.
   We see in these outrages much to deplore, and
we see much which merits unqualified condemna-
tion, which has been done and omitted, during the
violence of these lawless excesses. But it behooves
all of us now to be calm, and firm, to prevent ano-
ther outbreak—to unite and draw out for the pre-
servation of the public peace, all good citizens.—
Many have hitherto done little to stop this destruc-
tive violence, who should unite, and we still trust
nearly all will yet unite, to restore the quiet of our
city, and efficacy to the law. Hereafter, when the
public mind is in condition to be reasoned with, we
shall speak as we think upon this subject, offend
whom it may.
   The mob was in many cases encouraged, and in
some, led on, by persons from Kentucky. They de-
clared they had been sent for, and that hundreds of
others were organized and ready to come here to rid
the city of the negroes and abolitionists.
   We ourselves heard one of these, a respectable
looking man, shouting to the mob to put down the
Mayor and others. In some cases the motions of
the mob were directed and managed by mere boys,
who suggested the points of attack and the object,
put the vote, declared the result, and led the way!
Think for one moment, a band calling themselves
<i>men</i>, disarming, carrying away and securing in
prison, the male negroes, promising security and
protection to their women and children—and while
they were confidently reposing in that security, re-
turn with hellish shouts, to attack these helpless
and unprotected persons! The cowardly character
of the attack distinctly shows the want of <i>manly
feelings</i> in the assailants. We cannot use terms
too strong to mark the leaders and instigators of
this mob—though we sincerely think there were
many honest, but misguided men engaged in it,
who will themselves regret it most deeply.
   Excitement continued during yesterday. The
Council held a meeting, and a meeting of the citi-
zens succeeded, in which the Governor, who is in
this city, with other gentlemen, took part. Reso-
lutions were adopted for an efficient organization
for the night.
			<i>Monday Morning, 3 A. M.</i>
   No disturbances have occurred in our city du-
ring the night. The different military compa-
nies were stationed at various points through the
city. Captain Taylor's troop of horse, together
with a large number of citizens, formed them-
selves into companies of about thirty each, who
kept up a patrol until about two o'clock, when
the citizens generally retired, leaving the military
on duty.
   O<small>NE</small> D<small>AY</small> L<small>ATER</small>.—Our yesterday's narrative of
the violent outrageous movements against the
<d>[Col.5]</d>
peace of the city, was penned amidst confusion and
excitement, and is full of inaccurate expressions,
though we have learned nothing that leads us to
doubt the main facts. The city remained quiet
when we went to press, and no farther outbreak is
immediately apprehended. The police, strength-
ened and duly organized, will keep up the most vi-
gilant <u title="reconnaissance">reconnoisance</u>, with ample reserve at com-
mand, to act at a moment's warning.
   We were informed yesterday, upon good authori-
ty, that the boys wounded up Columbia street, on
Thursday night, are doing well, and acknowledge
that they made the attack upon the negroes that
night. The number killed, if any, is yet unknown,
and the <u title="number wounded is (in Hazard's Register)">number is</u> equally uncertain. The negroes
in jail, were examined yesterday by the Committee
of Safety. There is but one additional fact, we
learned yesterday. That is, that although free in-
gress to the prison had been allowed to our Ken-
tucky neighbors, in search of fugitive slaves, but
one has been claimed from the whole mass, and he
is separated from the rest and held for proof in sup-
port of the claim.
   Since the above was written, we have learned
that the Committee of Safety have visited the jail,
and determined to proceed to-morrow to act upon
the cases of the negroes now held in confinement,
as follows: 1. To ascertain such against whom
there is any criminal charge, and detain them for
further examination. 2. As to those against whom
there is no accusation—to discharge natives and
those who have given bond under the law of 1807
—and to require bond of the others under that law,
and to discharge when it is given.—<i>Cincinnati
Gazette, Monday 6th</i>.

		<b>The Mary Rogers Case.</b>

life, is believed to have been discovered. A

		<b>The Riot at Cincinnati.</b>
   A letter from Cincinnati, received at the of-
fice of the New York New Era, gives the fol-
lowing additional particulars:
			C<small>INCINNATI</small>, Sept. 4th, 1841.
   Our city is at this moment the threats of the
most terrible excitement I have ever witnessed.
The military are patrolling the streets, and her-
alds are out, by order of the Mayor, calling
upon the citizens to meet at 10 o'clock, this
morning, at the Market House, to devise meas-
ures for the preservation of the peace, and pro-
tection of our citizens. The whites and ne-
groes have had a terrible battle, in which sev-
eral men are reported to have been killed and
a number badly wounded. As I have but a
few minutes to write before the close of the
eastern mail, I can give but a brief narration of
this dreadful affair. On the evening before
last, it appears that a quarrel occurred between
several negroes and two white men, in which
the latter were badly wounded, with dirk knives.
This occasioned considerable excitement, and
added fresh fuel to the <i>anti-negro</i> flame, which
has been increasing in intensity and volume,
with threatening rapidity of late.
   About 9 o'clock last evening, a large con-
course of people, without concert or arms, as-
sembled at the junction of Sixth street and
Broadway, in the immediate vicinity of the
“Five Points” of this city, or as it is called
here “Nigger-town.” A few persons in the
mob, (which consisted of 3 or 400,) apparently
without any deliberate design, threw stones
against the buildings of the negroes. The ne-
groes immediately poured into the mob a vol-
ley of bullets, from muskets and rifles, with
which they had previously provided themselves
in anticipation of an attack.
   The mob being unarmed, fled precipitately,
and were <i>hotly pursued for nearly a square by the
blacks</i>, who yelled out a wild shout of triumph
and defiance, and then returned to their houses.
During the firing a number of the negroes were
stationed on the tops of their own and the ad-
joining houses, from which they levelled their
pieces at the crowd.
   The mob continued at bay till after midnight,
by which time, perhaps, thirty or forty of the
assailants provided themselves with arms, and
a <i>six-pounder cannon</i>. Thus equipped they ad-
vanced to the position they occupied in the
early part of the evening, loaded their cannon
with fragments of iron, and levelled its muzzle
against a building about one hundred yards dis-
tant, in which a large number of armed negroes
were said to be stationed.
   After a few ineffectual shots from the small
arms of the assailants, the cannon was dis-
charged, but without effect. The negroes quick-
ly rallied, and returned a heavy fire from their
houses, but the whites stood their ground, reload-
ing and discharging their six pounder cannon
several times, and kept up also a brisk fire with
their small arms. The conflict was terrible,
but fortunately for the lives of many, the prompt
arrival of the military silenced the firing, re-
stored peace and dispersed the mob.
   Since three o'clock this morning our city
has enjoyed its usual repose, but these are ap-
prehensions of a dreadful and concerted attack
upon the blacks to-night, which of course the
law abiding portion of our citizens will exert
themselves to prevent. There are various re-
ports of the number killed and wounded on both
sides, but it is impossible to ascertain the truth
of these reports at present.
   The negroes were the victors! What will
be the result of this? The negroes victorious!
think of that! A crowd of people have just
passed my window in pursuit of some blacks,
and I am informed by a friend at my elbow
that the city is all in confusion and uproar again,
and that terror-struck negroes are flying in all
directions.
   There is no fighting or lynching, but the peo-
ple, <i>the mob</i>, are taking the negroes into custo-
dy as fast as they can be caught, with the de-
sign of enforcing a law of this State, which re-
quires all colored residents of Ohio to give bond
for their good behavior, or leave the State. I
will keep you advised of the progress of this
negro war.

		<b>A Female Swindler.</b>
   The Rochester Daily Advertiser gives a
minute account of the operations of a female
imposter in that city, which are worth repeat-
ing, and which we will embody in a small
space. She came to that place four or five
weeks since; professed to be an English lady,
though recently from Toronto, in Canada;
claimed the maiden name of Ann Eliza Hunt;
said she had a large property just increased by
the death of her uncle and aunt; was richly,
though somewhat slovenly dressed, of good per-
sonal appearance, and aged about thirty-five.
As a lady of fortune she soon became a toast,
and a young man of the place tendered his heart
and hand. He was accepted; marriage settle-
ments were made; mine host where the lady
boarded was directed to furnish a sumptuous
wedding entertainment, which was done, and
the marriage was consummated in due form.
The next day, in the best carriage which could
be obtained, the happy pair rode about the city,
the bride ordering numerous articles of furni-
ture, besides wearing apparel for herself and
lord, to no small amount. In the afternoon of
the day she told her husband she wished to
take a short drive on some business, and hoped
he would not take it amiss if she preferred go-
ing alone, which he willingly assented to. She
went, and night came without her returning; so
did the next day and night; and days and nights
thereafter. People began to suspect that all
was not right, but the husband had full faith.
Finally, however, he presented a draft she had
given upon the bank for more than a thousand
dollars, and was met with a rebuff of “no
funds;” and then he gave in. The landlord, be-
sides the cost of the wedding supper, is minus
$56 of borrowed money. The young man is
married but without a wife, and has already
had bills to the amont of $1800 of her crea-
ting presented against him. This is a clean
shave on a big figure; and those who have been
imposed upon, while they will be pitied by
some, will be laughed at by all.—<i>Poughkeepsie

   <i>The Case of Miss Rogers</i>.—Morse, who
was the individual arrested near Worcester,
Mass., on suspicion of having been implica-
ted in the murder of Miss Rogers, has proved
to the satisfaction of the police, at least, that
he was somewhere else on the fatal day and
night, and has consequently been discharged
from custody. He was subsequently arrest-
ed on the charge of assault and battery
against his wife, but that difficulty appears
to be settled, and Morse is now at large.
This throws the whole affair into impene-
trable mystery again. No clue can be dis-
covered in any direction. The opinion is
fast gaining ground that the poor girl met
her fate on this side of the river, and not
many blocks from her mother's door. It is
devoutly to be hoped, that such a shocking
outrage will not be suffered to be buried in
obscurity.

murdered.
   The spot at which this unfortunate girl lost
her life, is believed to have been discovered. A
little boy living at Weehawken brought some
days since to his mother, a hat tassel, which he
found in the woods or bushes in the neighbor-
hood, and some other articles of female apparel.
Information of this having reached the Mayor,
he visited the mother, was shown by the boy to
the place, and there found other pieces of her
clothes and indications around of a violent strug-
gle having taken place.
   Among the articles found, were a parasol, a
shawl, a pocket handkerchief, and an under
garment, supposed to be hers. Fragments of
garments were found on the bushes. The
place was visited by the Mayor, the District
Attorney, Dr. Cook, and others, on Saturday
and Sunday last, and the gentlemen were sat-
isfied from the scene, the centre of a close
thicket, and the general appearance of the
place, that it was the theatre of outrage. We
trust that this discovery will lead to an elu-
cidation of this mystery. As the evidence is
yet concealed, we have, as yet, no comments
to make, but merely state the conclusion to
which the mayor has arrived.—[N. Y. Tat-

F<small>OUND IN THE REAR OF A</small> N<small>EW</small> H<small>OUSE IN</small> L<small>ISPENARD
STREET</small>.—Yesterday a great excitement was created
by the discovery of the body of a woman, in the
sink or privy of an uninhabited house in Lispenard
street, one door from Broadway. The Coroner was
sent for, and the body taken out when it appeared
to be that of a good looking young woman, about
twenty-five years of age, auburn hair, braided in
front. Dress dark figured calico frock, white cot-
ton petticoat, but neither shoes <u>or</u> stockings. She
had a light common hood over her head, and bore
the appearance of some maid servant, who had run
out in a hurry. Probably the deceased had gone to
the building to meet some lover or other, and had
fallen into the hole, which was entirely uncovered.
   A jury having been empanelled, the following tes-
timony was adduced:—
<m9>   Patrick <u title="Dickey (elsewhere)">Dickie</u> deposed that he owned the unfinished
building in which the body was found. Had been much
annoyed by dissolute people going there of nights and
taking up their quarters there. On Thursday morning
witness was called to see a negro, who was found in the
building, and on looking about discovered the body of
the deceased in the sink or privy. Does not know who
the deceased is, nor how she came there. The privy is
entirely new, had not been used, and contains about for
feet of water.
   Dr. Abraham <u title="Creveling, Croveling (elsewhere)">Crewsburg</u> deposed that he made an ex-
ternal examination of the body, and found no marks of
violence. It is a female, and supposed to have been there
about <u title="14 in 2nd ed, and seems faded to 11 in 1st">14</u> days. It is much advanced in putrefaction, and
a further post mortem examination would be unnecessa-
ry.
   The jury found “that the unknown female died from
some cause unknown to them.”</m9>

<b>The Case of Mary Rogers—The Place of the
			 Murder.</b>
   The late investigations and discoveries in relation
to the murder of this unfortunate girl have settled
two important points. First, the place where she
was last seen alive; secondly, the place where she
was murdered.
   The former place is the little wooden tavern close
at the foot of Weehawken Hill, formerly known as
“Nick Moore's House,” a very admirable represen-
tation of which we give above. This tavern on a
Sunday in fine weather is visited by numbers of
ladies and gentlemen from New York, who usually
come there in parties of two and four; no lady ever
coming without a gentleman to accompany her. At
this house the visiters usually stay for half an hour,
to rest and refresh themselves with wine, lemonade,
cold cuts, &c. before they ascend the <u title="Weehawken">Weekawken</u>
Hill, or stroll along the lower road towards Bull's
Ferry, or Hamilton's Monument, at the Duelling
Ground.
   Half way between the Elysian Fields and Nick
Moore's House there is a small wooden shanty, on
the mud bank, where liquor is sold, and where
almost every Sunday crowds of rowdies, armed with
sticks, arrive in boats, (which they can moor close
up to the house) drink, swear, fight, and sally forth
towards the Weehawken Hill, frequently insulting
and beating all they meet on their way, besides eat-
ing and drinking wherever they can, and then, <u>by
by</u> reason of their numbers and their weapons, re-
fusing to pay for anything.<a id="Herald-1841-09-17-Col3-Adam-stage-driver"></a>
   In the afternoon of the fatal Sunday on which
Mary Rogers was murdered, she was seen to arrive
at Hoboken, about 3 o'clock, by the ferry boat.
Adam ——, the stage driver for Mr. Van Buskirk,
and another young man, saw her and recognised her
as she left the boat, and made a remark to that effect
at the time. She was then in company with a dark
complexioned young man; and, as they left the
ferry, they took the road to Weehawken. Adam,
the stage driver, also saw the body when found near
the Sybil's Cave, and recognised it at once—so that
there should seem to be no mistake about this.
   On the same Sunday afternoon—the day of the
murder—Mrs. Loss, (a fine, intelligent, good look-
ing lady, about thirty years of age, and of German
descent,) who now keeps the tavern formerly kept
by Nick Moore, states that among many others who
came to her house, was a young lady about the age
and exact appearance of Mary Rogers, and dressed
precisely as Mary Rogers was said to have been
dressed. This young lady reached her house about
4 o'clock, in company with a dark complexioned
young man. Mrs. Loss says that she was very affa-
ble and modest in her behavior. Mrs. L. took seve-
ral glasses of liquor into the parlor, where the com-
pany (five or six ladies, and as many gentlemen)
were sitting; Miss Rogers was sitting on the settee
—the young gentleman rose to hand her a glass of
liquor, when she said, “I'll take lemonade.” Soon
after this she took the arm of the young man, and
walked out towards the hill, bowing to Mrs. L. as
she went out. Mrs. L. was induced to notice her<a id="Herald-1841-09-17-Col3-Marys-dress"></a>
dress (a light, peculiar striped one) particularly, and
observed to her eldest boy, “that's a very pretty
young lady, and has got a dress on exactly like your
aunt had, when she last came here before she died.”
   This was the last that Mrs. Loss ever saw of the
unfortunate Mary Rogers. And now, to be correct
in the order of time, we may here state that, on that
Sunday afternoon, there were a much larger num-
ber of fire rowdies, butcher boys, soap-locks, and all
sorts of riotous miscreants over at Weehawken, and
almost all of them armed with sticks. A great many
came in row boats to the rum hole on the mud <u title="bank">bunk</u>;
and two boats in particular, (one with six and the
other with nine desperadoes in them) landed their
contents at the little wharf on Mr. King's property,
not far from Ludlow's place. These scoundrels
came up to the little shanty by the road side, next
to Nick Moore's house, and there called for drink,
seized all the cakes, &c. and ate them—refused to
pay anything, and threatened to beat every body that
interfered with them. All these had clubs. They
then went toward the hill, and remained prowling
about till after dark, when the two boats in question
left in a great hurry.
   The poor girl, Mary Rogers, it is said by those who
assert they saw her, went up the Weehawken Hill;
strolled nearly a mile beyond the hotel on the top, in
company with the young man already mentioned.—
The rain came on, and she took shelter in a small
house or tavern near the road side. Here also a parcel
of the rowdies came, drank, and were very insolent.
Mary and her companion, detained by the rain, did
<u title="not">nor</u> leave the house till near or after dark, when they
descended the hill; and when near the foot of it,
another shower came on; it is believed they then
took shelter under some bushes in the side of the
hill, between the two roads; and there it is also be-
lieved both were murdered, and the poor girl viola-
ted.
   In confirmation of this, Mrs. Loss says, that she
sent her little boy, Oscar, soon after dark, to drive a
bull down the lower road to Ludlow's. Some time
after he left she heard what she calls a frightful
screaming as of a young girl in great distress, partly
choked, and calling for assistance, and sounded like
“oh! oh! God,” &c., uttered in great agony. So
loud were the screams that her other son heard them
down in the cellar. She thought the bull had tossed
her boy, and rushed out in terror, calling his name
down the road to Ludlow's. As soon as she called
out, there was a noise as of struggling, and a stifled
suffering scream, and then all was still. She reach-
ed Ludlow's, passing the very scene of the murder,
found her boy safe, and returned to the house. And
<d id="Herald-1841-09-17-Col4">[Col.4]</d>
as there had been several noisy fights that day, she
thought no more of the screaming.
   Time passed on, until the 25th of last month. On
that day her boys were out collecting sassafras bark,
and chanced to penetrate the small thicket between
the two roads, on the side of the hill where the mur-
der was committed. Here there are three or four
very large stones, forming a kind of seat, with back
and footstool to it. The boughs and briar bushes are
twined thickly around it, and there is not room
scarcely to stand upright in it. In fact, it is a place
fit for such a murder, and one from which the un-
fortunate girl could not have escaped, without viola-
tion, if ever she was forced into it. On the upper
stone lay a white garment. The little boy ex-
claimed, “Halloo! here's somebody has left their
shirt.” The big boy picked it up, and found it was a
woman's petticoat. On the second stone lay the
identical silk scarf (all crumpled up, as if torn off for-
cibly), which was worn by the young lady who was
at Mrs. Loss's house, and which has been identi-
fied as Mary Rogers' scarf. The petticoat had been
darned in a hurry, and that has been identified. In a
little hollow between the seat stone and a trunk of a
small tree, lay Mary Rogers' parasol and pocket hand-
kerchief, marked with her name. A little further off
lay her gloves, turned inside out, as if they had been
forcibly drawn from her hands in a hurry. And on
one of the briar bushes, hung two pieces of her dress,
which had evidently been torn out, as she was
dragged through this horrid place; one piece of the
dress was so doubled as to have a thorn three times
through it. The place around was stamped about,
and the branches were broken, and roots bruised and
mashed, all betokening that it had been the scene of
a very violent struggle. The marks of a high-heeled
boot were very plain. And it appeared from the po-
sition of the articles, as if the unfortunate girl had
been placed upon the middle broad stone, her head
held forcibly back, and then and there horribly vio-
lated by several rowdies, and ultimately strangled.—
The spot is not far from the river—the access to
the water easy—and the rails between it and the
river were all found taken down, as if the bodies of
Mary Rogers and the young man had both been
carried thence from the scene of the murder.<a id="Herald-1841-09-17-Col4-Marys-things"></a>
   In order that it may not be supposed that these
things were placed there recently, it is proper to
state, that from their appearance this could not have
been the case. The things had all evidently been
there at least three or four weeks. They were all
mildewed down hard with the action of the rain,
and stuck together from mildew. The grass had
grown around and over some of them. The silk
<u title="on the parasol was (in 2nd edition)">and the parasol were</u> strong, but the threads of
it were run together, within the upper part where
it had been doubled and folded was all mildewed
and rotten, and tore on its being opened. The white
linen handkerchief had a corded border round it,
and was mildewed also. So was the scarf. This
and the petticoat were crumpled up as if in a strug-
gle. The pieces of her frock torn out by the bushes
were about three inches wide and six inches long.
One part was the hem of the frock, and it had been
mended; the other piece was part of the skirt, not
the hem. They looked like strips torn off, and were
on the thorn bush, about a foot from the ground.
The petticoat, shawl, &c. were full of little bugs,
called by the Dutch, <u title="Kellerassel (CELLAR WOODLOUSE, almost like 'kellerasle' in 2nd ed)">kellerasbe</u>, that is, in English,
cellar <u>jackass</u>, an insect that always gets into cloth-
ing lying in wet places.
   All the articles found were taken great care of by
Mrs. Loss, who took the earliest opportunity of de-
livering them up to the Mayor of this city, and ac-
quainting him with all the details of the case.
   Such are some of the strong features of the late
movements in relation to this extraordinary murder.
   We have a variety of facts and inferences bearing
on this mystery of blood, which we shall give ano-
ther day.

   R<small>USSIA</small>.—The Augsburg Gazette of the 19th
ult. furnishes details relative to the Russian loan
of 30,000,000 rubles of silver. The banks are au-
thorised to issue successively notes to the amount
of 30,000,000 rubles of silver, with a stipulation of
guarantees for the same on mortgages. It is said
that the new financial measures announce a
change of ministers, which intelligence <u>is is</u> the
more agreeable that it may be supposed the com-
mercial policy of Russia will be modified; it is
even affirmed that Russia has hinted the conclu-
sion of a treaty between herself and Prussia.

6th.—The efforts of Russia to subdue the moun-
taineers of the Caucasus continue without inter-
mission. The Russian general commanding the
4th corps of the Russian army, arrived on the 7th
of July at Belz, where he was received by the
General of Division, Von Bushan, and Brigadier
General Von <u title="Marias (Caledonian-1841-09-28)">Matias</u>. On the following days there
were reviews of the troops evolutions, and firing
at a mark, and it is affirmed that a division of this
corps is in daily expectation of orders to march to
the theatre of war. The accounts, however, at the
theatre of war in the Caucasus, as well as in Geo-
rgia, are by no means favorable to the Russian
army.
   The enemy fight desperately, to the astonish-
ment of every body, with continually renewed
vigor, so that the laurels gathered by the superior
Russian forces are very scanty, and accompanied
with the most lamentable sacrifices. To this
must be added the great difficulty of supplying the
troops with provisions, who in general receive
only bad nourishment, and sometimes, for days
together, none at all, which, with the influence of
the climate, fearfully thins the ranks of the Rus-
sian troops.

   I<small>NQUESTS</small>.—Mysterious Death.—The Coroner
yesterday held an inquest at 414 Broadway, on
the body of an unknown female, aged about 25
years, who was found yesterday morning in an
open sink in the rear of a house in the course of
erection in Lispenard street, near the corner of
Broadway. There was about 4 feet of water in
the sink, and the deceased appeared to have been
there some two weeks, and as there was nothing
to prevent a person walking into the sink, it is
most probable this female walked or fell into it,
when in a state of intoxication. She had auburn
hair, braided apparently in front, and was dressed
in a dark figured calico frock, white cotton petti-
coat, a common light colored muslin hood, and
was without stockings or shoes. Dr. <u title="Crewsburg, Creveling (elsewhere)">Croveling</u>
and the coroner, Dr. Archer, made an external ex-
amination of the body, but no vestige of violence
could be discerned, and the body was in such a
state of putrefaction, that a post mortem examina-
tion would have been of no use whatever.
   Patrick <u title="Dickie (elsewhere)">Dickey</u>, apothecary and druggist in
Broadway, stated before the jury that he is build-
ing the house in Lispenard street, to which there
are no doors, and that he has been greatly annoy-
ed by dissolute persons going into the building to
sleep when they were drunk, ever since it has
been enclosed; that yesterday he was called to
see a negro who had intruded himself into the pre-
mises, and in looking into the sink discovered
something afloat, which he at first supposed was
the body of some quadruped or animal, but soon
after it was discovered to be that of a woman.—
The jury returned a verdict that the deceased
came to her death from some cause to them un-
known.

					<f9>From The Gift for 1842.</f9>
			<f15>ELEONORA.</f15>
				——
		<f9 style="letter-spacing:.3em">BY EDGAR A. POE.</f9>
				——
   I <small>AM</small> of a race noted for vigor of fancy and ardor
of passion. Pyrros is my name. Men have called
me mad; but the question is not yet settled whe-
ther madness be or be not the loftier intelligence—
whether much that is glorious—whether all that is
profound—do not spring from disease of thought,
from moods of mind exalted at the expense of the
general intellect. They who dream by day are
cognizant of many things which escape the dream-
ers by night. In their gray visions they obtain
glimpses of eternity, and thrill, in awaking, to find
that they have been upon the verge of the great
secret. In snatches they learn something of the
wisdom which is of good, and more of that mere
knowledge which is of evil. They penetrate, how-
ever rudderless or compassless, into the vast ocean
of the 'light ineffable,' and, again, like the adven-
turers of the Nubian geographer, 'They are
caught in an ocean of difficulties because in that
they would adventure a discovery.'
   We will say then that I am mad. I grant, at
least, that there are two distinct conditions of my
mental existence—the condition of a lucid reason,
	...
   She was a maiden artless and innocent as the
brief life she had led among the flowers. No guile
disguised the fervor of love which animated her
heart—and she examined with me its inmost re-
cesses, as we walked together in the Valley of the
<d>[Col.2]</d>
Many-Colored Grass, and discoursed of the mighty
changes which had lately taken place. At length,
having spoken, one day, in tears, of the last sad
change which must befall humanity, she thencefor-
ward dwelt only upon this one sorrowful theme, in-
terweaving it into all our converse—as in the songs
of the Bard of Shiraz the same images are found oc-
curring again and again in every impressive <u title="variation">varia-
ation</u> of phrase.
	...					And with
these words upon her lips she yielded up her inno-
cent life, putting end to the first epoch of my own.
	...
   I wedded, nor dreaded the curse I had invoked,
and its bitterness was not visited upon me. And
in the silence of the night there came once again
through my lattice the soft sighs which had forsaken
me, and they modeled themselves into a sweet voice
saying—“Sleep in peace; for the spirit of Love
reigneth and ruleth; and in taking to thy passion-
ate heart her who is Ermengarde, thou art absolved,
for reasons which shall be made known to thee in
Heaven, of thy vows unto Eleonora.”
			—————
	...
   L<small>ESSONS IN</small> P<small>UNMANSHIP</small>.—Mr. T. Hood, Pro-
fessor of <i>Punmanship</i>, begs to acquaint the dull
and witless that he has established a class for the
acquirement of an elegant and ready style of pun-
ning, on the pure <u title="Joe-millerian (elsewhere)">Joe Millerian</u> principle. The
very worst hands are improved in six short and
mirthful lessons. As a specimen of his capability,
he begs to subjoin two conundrums, by Col. Sib-
thorpe:			<small>COPY.</small>
   “The following is a specimen of my punning <i>be-
fore</i> taking six lessons of Mr. T. Hood: Q. Why
is a fresh plucked carnation like a certain <i>cold</i> with
which children are affected? A. Because it's a
<i>new pink off</i>, (an <u title="hooping (elsewhere)">whooping</u> cough.)
   “This is a specimen of my punning <i>after</i> taking
six lessons of Mr. T. Hood: Q. Why is the differ-
ence between pardoning and thinking no more of an
<d>[Col.3]</d>
injury the same as that between a selfish and a gen-
erous man? A. Because the one is <i>for-getting</i>
and the other <i>for-giving</i>.”

		<b>University Medical School.</b>
   It is scarcely necessary to state that the assertion
in Saturday's <i>Courier</i> that Professors Mott and Pat-
tison had authorized that paper to announce that the
non-professional public reporters were in future
to be excluded from the surgical <i>clinique</i> is <i>totally
false</i>; and we have the most unquestionable autho-
rity in saying that the silly falsehood has, as may
well be supposed, called forth the honest indigna-
tion of the respected Professors.
   The first case presented last Saturday to a crowded
audience,—amongst whom we recognized several
literary and scientific gentlemen unconnected with
the medical profession,—was one of strumous in-
flammation of the knee joint, occurring in an adult.
	...
   The next case was a truly frightful one. It was
that of an elderly man, with a cancer of the tongue.
The disease had made such progress at altogether
to preclude the least hope of surgical relief.
	...
   “Did you ever show this to a Doctor?”
   “I did, sir, several years ago.”
   “And what did he say it was?”
   “Why, sir, he said as how I had got <i>tape-worms</i>
in my mouth.” (Great laughter.)
   The Professor then examined the poor man's
tongue more particularly, and found that the disease
had extended so far as to render it quite impossible
to apply a ligature for the purpose of removing the
ulcerated mass. The submaxillary glands were also
affected, and on one side were swollen very conside-
rably. The Professor after stating the hopelessness
of the case, remarked that medical men should
listen with great respect to the accounts of the opera-
tion of popular remedies for this terrible disease. He
himself always did, in the hope that something might
be found useful. It might well be a source of the most
poignant regret to every medical man, that as yet,
no available remedy for that purpose had been dis-
covered. The Professor then made some remarks
respecting the proper mode of removing portions of
the tongue by ligature, and referred to several inte-
resting cases, one of them a recent one, in which he
had performed the operation with gratifying success.
He then said that in the present case, he could only
recommend the exhibition of arsenic—or some of
the combinations of iodine and mercury. “Fow-
ler's solution” was recommended as a good form of
the former medicine, and <u title="Labarraque">Labbarache</u>'s solution of
the chloride of soda, was stated to be the best local
application.

   M<small>ORE OF THE</small> H<small>ABEAS</small> C<small>ORPUS</small> S<small>YSTEM</small>.—The notori-
ous Melinda Hoag was arrested one day last week on a
charge of robbing preferred by a Southern gentleman,
who does not like to have his name in print, and commit-
ted to the tombs. On Friday, Melinda was arraigned in
the star chamber and committed for trial. On Saturday
a writ of habeas corpus was procured and Melinda taken
before Judge Lynch and admitted to bail in $400. In the
mean time the name of the southern gent is carefully
veiled from the vulgar eye.
   J<small>USTICE</small> P<small>ARKER</small>.—The replies to the several charges
preferred against this high legal functionary have been
served on the counsel of the complainant, and the Dis-
trict Attorney is prepared to go with his accustomed furor
and zeal, into the cause of the complainant. The learn-
ed gentleman only waited for the order of the Court, and
did not decline the aid of his powerful talents from any
desire to screen a magistrate as some ignorant individu-
als have asserted. In the meantime the trial of Judge
Wiley must not be forgotten, or that certain charges were
published in the Board of Aldermen against the func-
tionaries of another of the civil tribunals. Great times
these, certainly. Three Judges on trial at one time, and
the pay of two others denied, and their authority ques-
tioned by those who hold the purse of the commonalty.

village last week by Judge Gridley, came on the
trial of the libel suit brought by James <u title="Fenimore">Fennimore</u>
Cooper against Park Benjamin, editor of the New
World. The publication of the offensive matter
was admitted in the pleadings, and being consid-
ered as a mere technical libel that would not jus-
tify exemplary damages, the only effort made on
his part by counsel was to impress the jury with
the same idea, and thus secure a nominal verdict
which if obtained would tend to the discredit of
the plaintiff. This attempt availed nothing, for
the defendant was mulcted in $375 damages.—
Richard Cooper and S. S. Bowne, for Plaintiff;
Mr. Edwards, of N. Y. for defendant. Let it not
again be said by Mr. Cooper's persecutors, that a
jury of his own immediate fellow-citizens would
never award him a verdict in his libel cases.—

dant and his counsel, Charles <u title="O'Conner (elsewhere)">O'Connor</u> and W. M. Price,
appeared, to move that the indictment preferred against
William Wiley should be transmitted to the Court of
Oyer and Terminer for trial.
   Judge Wiley, in making the motion, said that he had
mentioned the matter to the District Attorney; and
that his learned friend had consented to waive all oppo-
sition.
   District Attorney: I have nothing to say, sir. I shall
leave the matter to the Court.
   The Recorder said, the Court had some doubts about
the course which ought to be pursued, and wished the
matter laid over until Wednesday.
   The District Attorney then called on the defendant to
plead.
   Mr. <u>O'Connor</u> said that his client would have no ob-
jection to plead, but it might be set up in bar to their ap-
plication by the Circuit Judges, and he was not willing
to permit his client to plead, unless the District Attorney
would give a written stipulation not to let the fact of
their pleading operate against the application to remove
the indictment into a higher Court.
   At this, the District Attorney said he should not inter-

and eventually it was ordered to stand over until Tues-

		<b>The Murder of Mary Rogers.</b>
   We have already given a very beautiful represen-
tation of the place where the poor girl, Mary Rogers,
was last seen alive. In the statement which accom-
panied that view, we observed that this young lady
was, beyond all question, murdered after her <u title="descent">dissent</u>
from the hill, in a close thicket, between the road
leading up to the Mountain House, and the road
leading to Mr. King's and Bull's Ferry.
   We now give, as above, a most admirably correct
representation of the spot where the murder and vio-
lation, beyond all doubt, were committed. The
place is not more <u title="than">that</u> 300 or 400 yards from Nick
Moore's house, and the entrance is close to a broad
green pathway, that once was a carriage road, but
now overgrown; and there is a pear tree in the
meadow opposite to the spot, and two beach trees
against the wall at the back of it.
   In the above picture the reader will see several
small letters for references, which it will be best to
explain at once. The figures, 1, 1, 1, are placed at the
exact point of entrance, which is rather less wide
than it appears in the picture, because here a full
inside view was necessary to be given. The figure
2, is placed on the large flat rock, upon which un-
doubtedly she sat or was held down at the time she
was brutally violated, and subsequently strangled
there. The <u title="figure">figuure</u> 3 is placed upon the rock at the
back of the other; this rock is higher than No. 2,
and appears to be the rock against which her
back was placed at the time of the commission
of the horrible outrage. Of course she struggled
violently, and as the top of the rock No. 3,
would come just across the shoulder bones of
a young woman when seated upon rock No. 2,
of course this would account for the excoriation
upon her back, <a class="l" href="#Herald-1841-08-17-2-Dr-Cook">described by Dr. Cook</a>, in his lucid
testimony, when he stated that, beyond all question,
she had been violated whilst laid upon, or against
some hard substance, certainly not on a bed. No. 4
is the upper rock of the whole in this thicket, and
there are marks upon it where a man's knee, in
struggling, has rubbed off all the moss. Upon this
rock her petticoat was found, lying crumpled up, by
the boys, which led to the discovery of the rest of
her things. No. 5 is the upper outlet from this scene
of blood, of infamy, into which a person can only
penetrate from two points; and when within it, it is
impossible for any to stand upright. At the upper
tree, to the right of figure 5, the boys were engaged
in stripping off sassafras bark, at the time they dis-
covered the petticoat. Our admirable artist has en-
deavored to delineate a portion of the trunk, with
the bark stripped off, as it appears on the spot. On
the left side of the rock No. 3, (as seen in the above
representation) the scarf was found lying. To the
left, again, of rocks 2 and 3, and in the hollow be-
tween them and another rock, the parasol and hand-
kerchief were found, as clearly represented in the
above drawing.
   Such, then, is a faithful and full representation of
the interior of the actual scene of the outrage and
murder upon poor Mary Rogers. A full and correct
view of the exterior, the place where the body was
found and where the boats lay, we shall give in the
course of the week, when we shall also give a varie-
ty of other particulars connected with this sad
affair.
   We have before stated that the interior of the
above place was torn, trampled and trodden down
as if by several persons in a violent struggle, and the
briars broken in many places; but, at the same time,
it is our firm belief that not more than four or five
persons could stand, or sit, or lie within the above
spot at one and the same time. The little white
briar bush, in the centre of the above picture, is the
one upon which the two pieces of her dress were
found. And it is a very remarkable fact (and one
which was not noticed at the time of her interment,
or at the inquest,) <i>that her shoes were pierced through
and through with large thorns</i>, precisely resembling
those found in the above thicket, and which are
of a very remarkable character. One of the boys
told us that he thought, from the position of the
pieces of the frock upon the briar bush, that the poor
girl was, in the first place, dragged or carried sense-
less into this spot and there murdered. This might
have been done at the time Mrs. Loss heard the
screams, and when she called out to her son Oscar.
At any rate the whole scene, and its attendant cir-
cumstances, show that the villains did their bloody
work in a great hurry.
   The night of this horrid murder was moonlight,
and the number of boats over at Weehawken was
greater than on any previous day during the sum-
mer. There were no less than six boats at one time
at the point, just by Ludlow's. Among them was
one very fast boat, full of rowdies, who were betting
and swearing that they could beat every other boat
there. The crews of several of the boats were fight-
ing and quarreling all the time; some went a little
higher up the river to the Weehawken rocks, and
there cooked chowders. A party were going up to-
wards King's, when one of another gang cried out,
“Boys, you'd better not go up there,” “Why
not,” was the query. “Because,” replied the first
speaker, “the last boat's crew that went up there
stole all the apples, and the man there has got a
gun, and swears he'll shoot whoever comes there.”
Upon this hint they departed, threatening ven-
geance. Another more peaceable party went in to
bathe, and a gang came down and tried to steal
their clothes, but were beaten off.
   Such are some of the facts connected with this
sad day and its dreadful deeds. We call on the po-
lice to find out what boats and what crews were
over at Weehawken that day. Look after the whole
of them, and examine them all thoroughly. Let
there be no <u title="remissness">remisness</u>, and this thing may yet be
found out; and the perpetrators punished. In
the mean time, we cannot conclude this article
better than by the insertion of the following lines up-
on the subject from the pen of a gifted and well
known poet—not Halleck:—
		<b id="Herald-1841-09-21-Girl-by-Clarke">The Beautiful Segar Girl.</b>
<m9>		<i>A Sketch of Violation and Murder</i>.
	  [From Unpub. Poems of McDonald Clarke.]
		There are tales which Truth can tell,
		That toll on the heart, like a funeral bell,
		Or a howl from—Hell.

	  She moved amid the bland perfume,
		That breathes of Summer's balmiest isle,
	  Her eyes had starlight's azure gloom,
		And a glimpse of Heaven—her smile.</m9>
<d>[Col.4]</d>
<m9>	  Fairest of the fading girls,
		Whom Want from Duty often lures,
	  Whose heart meets little from the World's,
		But trials that the proud—endures.

	  Who, that has loitered up Broadway,
		But mark'd her mid the evening light,
	  (Encircled by the young, and gay,)
		With face that said her soul was right.

	  Ay—she was beautiful, in form,
		More than beautiful, in mind,
	  Affections, more serene and warm,
		We seldom in <i>her</i> station, find.

	  That form, so delicate and ripe,
		Was bruised by the mangling clench of Lust,
	  The bosom that was virtue's type,
		Bedaub'd with slime, and foam, and dust.

	  Time will the bloody mystery bare—
		Lift the curst hand that grip'd her throat—
	  There did the foul Infernals lay her
		When they dragg'd her from the clotted boat.

		*	*	*	*	*
	  'Twas one of Summer's sighing eves,
		When Sunset, with her scarlet glow,
	  Shed a rich twilight thro' the leaves,
		As if Earth never dreamed of <u title="= woe">wo</u>.

	  But wo, and wretchedness that night,
		Suffer'd, as Woman only can,
	  When the grasp of guilt blows out the light,
		And Lust has madden'd to a monster—man.

	  The body of that gentle girl
		Was rip'd—but Shame forbids the tale,
	  Yet a night will surely come, to hurl
		These wretches, where the damned wail.

	  They must have drank that frantic draught
		That leaves the conscience drunk, and dumb,
	  For the <u title="deadliest">deadlest</u> Fiends have always laugh'd
		O'er the flash of Hell, thro' the fumes of <i>rum</i>.

		*	*	*	*	*
	  Young struggler—in the feverish dawn
		Of passions, that inflame the soul,
	  Go not where Guilt's wild dupes have gone—
		Grasp the stern arm of Self-Control.

	  Let not your dying pillow hold
		A head, pierced thro' with harrowing thought—
	  A spirit, to Damnation sold,
		The <u title="offal">offals</u> of rotten pleasure, bought.

	  Go where the glare of Lust lights up
		Hearts, that ne'er knew a calmer light—
	  Taste but the Tempter's scalding cup,
		And stagger to the sins of Night.

	  Drag out a pale, and bloated life
		For a few dim years, with madness, trod.
	  But there will come a frightful strife
		When you're left in the dark, with <i>Death</i>, and God.

	  These filthy slaves of Sin, and Wo,
		That skulk from Memory, and Despair,
	  Are wretched, whereso'er they go,
		That <i>night</i> is with them, everywhere.

	  They see an eye—Earth cannot see 't—
		An eye, that never closed in sleep—
	  They feel the pang, whose poisoned heat
		Cannot be quench'd—tho' Heaven should weep.

	  Wretches befoul this world, who give
		No token in their artful face,
	  Of where their souls shall gasp, yet live,
		When hurl'd down to their howling Place.

	  Among the mean, or ennobled vile,
		Hid in bleak holes, or banner'd walls,
	  The delicate Beast they will hug a while,
		Till the clod on—the coffin falls.

		*	*	*	*	*
	  Poor girl—there have been prayers for thee,
		And white hairs trembling o'er thy tomb,
	  Worn by childless Mother's knee,
		When sundown scarf'd it with her gloom.

	  Time heard, in his dreams, a burial bell—
		Saw a gallows, grinning, thro' the dark—
	  A corpse swung out 'mid a laugh, and yell—
		And left, with the Midnight, cold and stark.

<h2>Cincinnati Riot.
Dr. Jackson—Guilty of Producing Abortion</h2>

   T<small>HE</small> C<small>INCINNATI</small> M<small>OB</small>.—The Cincinnati Gazette
of the 14th gives a statement of circumstances out
of which sprung the late disgraceful riot in that
city. For some time past there seems to have been
a strong mutual aversion between the negroes and
white citizens. In 1826 the former numbered
960; in 1840 they had increased to 2,255, and at
present probably number 3,000. Many of these
are peaceable and industrious; others are idle and
vicious. Their labor comes into direct competi-
tion with that of the whites, and the feeling of
jealousy thus excited is kept alive by the collisions
growing out of their proximity to a slave state.
Many of the negroes too are noisy, swaggering
and extremely insolent. The adult males <u title="probably">pro-
baably</u> number six hundred. In June last a
Mr. McCalla went from Kentucky to Cincinnati
to reclaim a fugitive slave who had taken refuge
at the house of one Burnet, an Englishman; he
finally effected his purpose not without resistance
and the gathering of a mob. In the <u title="evening">ovening</u> a mob
of several hundred men and boys assailed the
house of Mr. Burnet but were soon dispersed by
the Police.
   In August a German, while defending his gar-
den against their depredations, was assailed by
two negroes, and so badly wounded that he is since
dead. The negroes were immediately apprehend-
ed. Some months since, a lady walking in the
streets in the morning was grossly insulted by sev-
eral negroes, who escaped apprehension. About
the same time the blacks greatly disturbed the
peace of the city by noise, &c. in the night. On
the Tuesday night previous to the mob a quarrel
arose, in which a white man was shot by a negro.
On Wednesday night a party of Irishmen, armed
with clubs, went to a house inhabited by negroes,
and demanded the one who shot their companion
on the previous night. A gun was fired, consid-
erable disturbance created, and the mob dispersed
by the watch. Early on Thursday evening a negro
man and woman, while walking in the market,
were assailed by some boys, who threw sand upon
them, and a slight quarrel ensued. The negro
went away and returned with another, when a
new quarrel ensued, in which two young men who
had come to the assistance of the boys were se-
verely wounded. On Friday there was great ex-
citement; the negroes were apprised of their dan-
ger, and armed for defence. Several white men,
one of them called a Judge, assisted in preparing
for defending the houses. The women and chil-
dren were sent away for safety. The outbreak
soon followed, with the details of which our read-
ers are already acquainted. These facts are given
as the several steps by which the mob spirit ad-
vanced to its full development.

			<i>From the Sun</i>.
	UNIVERSITY MEDICAL SCHOOL.
<l9>		<i>[Reported for the Sun.]</i>
   ☞ In the <i>Courier</i> of last Saturday the Editor
stated that he was “authorized by Professors Mott
and Pattison to announce that in future the non-pro-
fessional public and reporters for newspapers were to
be excluded” from the Surgical <i>clinique</i> of the Medi-
cal college. To those who are unacquainted with
the <i>Courier</i>'s proficiency in falsehood, we beg to state
that the above announcement is <i>entirely unauthorized
and wholly untrue</i>.</l9>
   <i>Remarks</i>.—The <i>Sun</i> then proceeds to make a full
report of the “operations” at the College on Satur-
day; which certainly would appear to warrant the
supposition, that we were <i>not authorized</i> to announce
that the doors of the institution would be closed
against every body not connected with the Medical
Profession.
   It becomes our duty, therefore, to say, that we
made the annunciation on the authority of Dr.
H<small>UGH</small> McL<small>EAN</small>, who distinctly stated to us that he
was requested by Professors M<small>OTT</small> and P<small>ATTISON</small> to
say to us, that henceforth the doors of the Institu-
tion would be closed against every body except Me-
dical men and Students, during their Surgical opera-
tions. We at first refused to made the announce-
ment without having it in writing from the Profes-
sors; but finally concluded to do so, well knowing
that no man in this City is worthy of more implicit
confidence than Dr. McL<small>EAN</small>. That the <i>Professors</i>
did authorize him to make the statement to us, no
person who knows Dr. McL<small>EAN</small>, his eminence in his
profession, and his unquestionable veracity, will for
a moment doubt. Why then this trifling with the
public? We shall sift this matter till the <i>truth</i> be
elicited.

<d>[Col.2]</d>
   <i>The Herald</i>.—We have received an able commu-
nication exhibiting in its true colors the character of
Mr. T<small>YLER</small>'s organ in this city; but here, it is too
well known to require any such “serving up.” The
communication like another of a similar character,
which we admitted in part, some weeks since, speaks
of the Herald as “the organ of J<small>OHN</small> T<small>YLER</small>, <i>Mad-
am</i> R<small>ESTELL</small> and Dr. <u title="BRANDRETH">B<small>RANDETH</small></u>.” This is unjust to
the latter individual. Madam R<small>ESTELL</small> is a disgrace
alike to her sex, to our city, to the paper in which her
advertisements appear, and to our Police; but not so
with Dr. B<small>RANDRETH</small>. He but advertises purely ve-
getable medicine in his own peculiar style, from which
tens of thousands think they have derived benefit,
and which the learned among the faculty, are ready
to admit can do no harm if they accomplish no good.
It is not proper therefore, to use his name in connec-
tion with that of the infamous R<small>ESTELL</small>; and we are
free to admit, that in all slight cases, we would much
prefer his simple and harmless vegetable preparation,
puffed as it is, to the <i>mineral drugs</i> of the apothecary
shops.

   T<small>HE</small> M<small>ARY</small> R<small>OGERS</small> A<small>FFAIR</small>.—Although the
actors in this horrible tragedy have not been
discovered, some facts have come to light
which define the site of the murder with
plausible accuracy. It appears, from a state-
ment published in the Herald, that Mary
Rogers was seen to cross the ferry on the day
of the murder, by Adam a stage driver, who
recognised her. She was afterwards seen by
Mrs. Loss, who keeps a house, formerly oc-
cupied by Nick Moore at the foot of Wee-
hawken Heights. Mrs. Loss's attention was
particularly called to her in consequence of
her wearing a dress similar to one worn by a
deceased relative. She was accompanied by
a dark complexioned young man. She was
afterwards seen about a mile and half be-
yond the hotel, on the heights. In the
evening, soon after dark, Mrs. Loss had oc-
casion to send her child, Oscar, to drive a bull
home. Soon after he was gone, she heard
dreadful screams and cries, which sounded
like “Oh! Oh! God!” She was frightened
for the child, thinking the bull had tossed
him, and rushed out. She then heard a
stifled, suffering scream, and all was still.
She found her boy safe, and thought no more
of the matter, further, than supposing it was
some fight of the drunken rowdies in the hab-
it of coming over on Sundays, and who, on
that day, were there in great numbers. On
the 25th ult., her boys were out collecting
sassafras bark, and penetrating a small thick-
et, discovered the identical scarf worn by the
young lady at Mrs. Loss's on the night of the
murder, also a parasol, and a pocket hand-
kerchief, marked with Mary Rogers name,
and other articles of dress. The conclusion
drawn is, that Mary Rogers and her attendant
were belated in consequence of the rain, and
in passing this thicket were set upon by some
of the rowdies, and probably both murdered.
There yet remains the man to be accounted
<u title="for">far</u>. Has his body been found, or has he not
been murdered, or is her so terrified, lest he
should be considered the murderer, that he
has not dared to come forward? He may do
so with safety, for the circumstantial evidence
points to the bloody act as the work of a gang
and not an individual.

reckless men, ready for any act of violence. The
row in Post Office alley, the night before last, and
the attempt to fire the Church on Longworth street,
mentioned in another column, show that beyond
doubt.
   Let it however be known that an efficient volun-

is ready for action. Rogues and rioters had better

   M<small>URDER AT</small> C<small>AMBRIDGEPORT</small>.—A most horrid
murder was committed yesterday at the Almshouse
in Cambridge. About 10 o'clock, A. M., one of the
inmates of the house, an Englishman, a native of
Halifax, N. S., by the name of William H. <u title="Britton (elsewhere)">Brittain</u>,
entered a room, where three female inmates were,
and with a large carving knife inflicted a mortal
wound upon Sarah Stevenson, a young woman of
Irish descent, about twenty years old, of which she
instantly died. He then attempted to take his own
life, but without success.
   Brittain had made proposals of marriage to the
young woman, who, for some time past had been out
of health, and was of an exemplary moral character,
which she had rejected, and it is supposed that he in-
tended to destroy her and himself, as he had two ra-
zors in his pocket. Brittain is a man of good edu-
cation, about fifty-six years old, and had been enga-
ged in teaching children in the establishment.
He was examined before Justice Chamberlain, and
committed for trial.—[Boston Merc. Jour.]

	TO THE FRIENDS OF A FREE PRESS.
   The presses of the Cincinnati <i>Philanthropist</i>, edited
by Dr. Gamaliel Bailey, Jun., having been destroyed by
a mob on Saturday night, 4th inst, an appeal has been
made by the editor, which is thus noticed in one of the
daily papers of this city:
<l9>   “We have received a copy of the Cincinnati Philan-
thropist, (Abolition paper) printed after the destruction
of its press for the third time by a mob. The editor says
he has been advised to suspend the publication of his
paper for the present, but that he cannot do so, as it
would be a sacrifice of the right of free discussion. 'So
long as the friends of liberty shall aid, by the help of our
Father in Heaven, we abide at our post. All we ask is
the means. Our Society is in debt. Our printer is a
poor man, and has lost all but his type. Perhaps $800
will cover his loss, and $100 ours.' We hope this loss
will be made up to them; and that others beside Aboli-
tionists will contribute for this purpose. It is a mean
and dastardly business to make war upon printing mate-
rials; and mob violence, in any shape, ought be frowned
upon by every friend of order and law.”</l9>

   A<small>WFUL</small> M<small>URDER OF A YOUNG</small> W<small>OMAN</small>.—Yes-
terday forenoon, a most fiendlike murder was com-
mitted in the Cambridge Alms House, (Cambridge-
port) on the person of a young woman named Sa-
rah Stevenson, by a man named William H. Brit-
ton. He plunged a huge carving knife in between
her right foreshoulder and breast, clear through
her heart and lungs, and out under her left shoul-
der-blade.
   Britton, as a pauper, became an inmate of the
Alms House in September, 1840, being aged and
somewhat infirm. He possessed some literary ac-
quirements, and was employed as a teacher to the
children in the establishment. In June last, Miss
Stevenson, then laboring under a painful disease,
became an inmate of the House, and, after she had
improved in health in some degree, she undertook
to learn to write under the instructions of Britton.
In consequence of the familiar intercourse natu-
rally arising thus, Britton conceived a violent pas-
sion for her, and proposed to marry her.
   She declined on account of his age and inability
to support a family. He pressed his suit, and she
laid the subject before Mr. Valentine, the excellent
superintendent, who at once advised her to avoid
Britton as much as she could, and told her, when-
ever he entered her room, to leave it, and come in-
to his private apartment. She acted upon this ad-
vice for some weeks. On Sunday morning, he en-
tered her room, and she then left it, and went into
one occupied by two other women.
   He did not immediately follow her, and she began
to read to her companions from a new testament,
which Mr. Valentine had presented to her. While
thus engaged, Britton entered, and said to the other
two women—“Is this your room?” Before they
returned any definite answer, he drew the carving
knife from under his shirt bosom, advanced towards
the deceased, seized her round the body, and flung
her on to a bed. One of the women caught hold
of him, but he turned upon her with the uplifted
knife, like a tiger, and she quailed before him.—
The other woman then grasped him round the
body, but was driven off in the same manner as the
first one. The deceased in the meantime was ex-
claiming—“<i>Don't kill me! Don't kill me!</i>” He
first made a violent pass at her throat, but she
partly stopped the knife with her right hand, in
which it cut a horrible gash, four inches long, but
only barely scratched her throat. He then struck
at her as above stated, and drove the knife clear
through the body.
   In the spasmodic agony of the moment, she
sprang from the bed, advanced toward the door,
and fell dead on the threshold. Mrs. Valentine had
rushed up to her assistance, and as she fell, bent
over her to raise her, but Britton also struck at
her, and forced her to keep back. “Murder” was
cried in every quarter of the building, and reached
the ear of James Forriter, teamster, in the yard,
who ran up stairs, and seized Britton while in the
act of bending over his murdered victim. When
seized, he dropped the knife like a child.
   A coroner's inquest was immediately held, and a
verdict of wilful murder returned. After a short
examination before Justice Chamberlain, a which
he confessed the deed, he was conveyed to the jail
at East Cambridge, kept by Mr. Watson.
   The deceased was a native of Ireland, about
twenty years of age—quite handsome, and very in-
telligent, and exceedingly desirous of mental im-
provement. she was very much respected, on ac-
count of her excellent conduct, notwithstanding
her poverty.
   Britton is fifty-seven years of age—a native of
Halifax, N. S., out of which port he has sailed ma-
ny years as master of a vessel. During the last
war he was taken by an American privateer, com-
manded by Capt. Crowninshield, and carried in a
prisoner at Salem. He is a widower, his wife ha-
ving been dead nine years, and during this period,
he has also buried two women-grown daughters.
   Half an hour before he committed the awful deed,
he led the religious services in the Sabbath School
of the establishment, with apparent profound sin-
cerity and devotion, and joined the children in sing-
ing, with marked fervor, the hymn, from the “Sab-
bath School Harp,” beginning with
<m9>	“How shall the young secure their hearts,
	  And guard their lives from sin?
	Thy word the choicest rules imparts,
	  To keep the conscience clean.”</m9>

concern is felt for his fate. His pecuniary affairs
were not embarrassed, he had some money with
him, and was a man of exemplary moral and reli-
gious character. It is hardly possible that he
should have gone off voluntarily, if in his right
mind. Any information of him, directed to Mr.
Monahan, Adams's printing office, corner of Ann
and Gold-streets, will be gratefully received by his
afflicted family.

			<b>County Court.</b>
   S<small>EPT</small>. 21.—This tribunal met yesterday, pursuant to
adjournment, for the trial of <u title="Miln">Milne</u> Parker, one of the
Special Justices, etcetera. At half past four the roll was
called by the clerk. Present, the Recorder, the Mayor,
and the three Judges of the Court of Common Pleas, to-
gether with seventeen Aldermen.
   Mr. Russell, counsel for Isaac J. Wood, the complain-
ant, then addressed the Court in support of the charges
and specifications, which, in substance, are as follows:—
   <i>First</i>.—For wrongfully arresting Wood on a com-
plaint of false pretences, and taking from his person
eleven one thousand dollar bills, three three dollar bills,
gold pencil, gold watch and chain, a due bill for two
thousand dollars, two pair of gloves, one penknife and a
draft for $175 75.
   <i>Second</i>.—For <u title="locking">looking</u> up Wood in the city prison, and
for an unwarranted and violent assumption of power on
the part of the said <u title="Miln">Milne</u> Parker, in locking said Wood
up in the prison, and for marking the word <i>private</i> on the
commitment.
   <i>Third</i>.—For maliciously and in direct violation of law
and his oath of office, in issuing two temporary commit-
ments against said Wood and Henry E. Willard, without
any complaints under oath, and for causing said Wood and
Willard to be dragged down to the prison and again
locked up.
	...
   <i>Fifth and Sixth</i>.—In maliciously causing certain arti-
cles to be inserted in the newspapers, and in paying over
to Howland & Aspinwall the sum of $11,000, which act
is a violent assumption of power unauthorized by any
law, and inconsistent with the magisterial duties of said
Parker.
   <i>Second Charge—First</i>.—In illegally arresting one James
Fitzsimmons, after he had been discharged by Justice
Matsell, and recommitting said Fitzsimmons to prison
without any of the requisitions of the statute being com-
plied with.
   <i>Second</i>.—In causing one Jeremiah Primrose to be arrest-
ed and sent to the Penitentiary, contrary and in direct vio-
lation of law.
   <i>Third</i>.—In illegally and without any complaint on affi-
davit, arresting one James T. Bacon, and confining him
in the City Prison for thirteen days.
   <i>Fourth</i>.—In illegally committing one Emma Bowling
to the Penitentiary as a vagrant, in a manner cruel, un-
just and oppressive, and not warranted by law.
   To these several charges the accused had put in long
answers, denying the malice as specified in causing the
arrest of Wood and Willard, and justifying himself in ta-
king the property of, and locking up Wood and Willard,
for reasons set forth respecting the minor charges.
   Isaac <u title="J. (elsewhere)">T.</u> Wood sworn and examined—Was arrested by
officer Collins at the Howard House, on the 13th of July,
and taken to Broad street at his (Wood's) request to see a
Mr. Willson. Went from there to the Police office be-
fore Justice Merritt. While there another officer came
and arrested witness on a bench warrant. Some short
time after this witness was taken into an inner room be-
fore Justice Parker, who, while sitting on the bench call-
ed witness a thief and other opprobrious words. Wit-
ness said he did not come there to be insulted. He re-
plied “you won't hey?” and then left the room by a
side door, and on his return he handed Collins, the offi-
cer, a paper, and told him “to search that man and take
any thing he has about him.” Witness requested to see
his attorney, to which the Justice replied “search him,
carry him off and lock him up.” Witness protested
against their right to search him in the presence of a la-
dy who was there, and after she was taken out he said
he had no objection provided they had a legal right so
to do. After some time five or six officers came in and
gathered round the witness. He asked for permission to
send for his counsel, but they paid no attention to his re-
quest, but proceeded to search, Parker telling Collins
“that if he did not do his duty immediately, he would
strike him off the list.”

   The case had not concluded when the Court rose and
adjourned.

<b>Great Meeting in the Ninth Ward to oppose
  the payment of Salaries to Messrs. Lynch
  and Noah.</b>
   A very large and highly respectable meet-
ing was held last night at the Jefferson Hall, in the
9th Ward, to sustain those members of the Board of
Supervisors, who have voted against the payment
of salaries to Messrs. Lynch and Noah, and particu-
larly to sustain their very worthy and efficient Al-
derman, Mr. Leonard, in the course he has taken.
   Mr. Gilbert called the meeting to order by nomi-
nating <u title="Stephen">Stepen</u> D. Gardner as Chairman. Thomas
H. Allaire and Jonathan <u title="O. Wickes (elsewhere)">A. Weeks</u> were chosen
Secretaries.
   The call of the meeting was read, and a commit-
tee of five were appointed to draft resolutions.
Messrs. Garrett Gilbert, J. V. Greenfield, Ed. Pat-
terson, Thomas Lloyd and J. McMillan, were ap-
pointed a committee, and they reported the follow-
ing resolutions:—
<m9>   Whereas, the Board of Supervisors of the city and
county of New York have refused to pay James Lynch
and Mordecai M. Noah the salaries claimed by them as
Judges of the Courts of General and Special Sessions of
the Peace for the city and county of New York, on the
ground that the Act of the Legislature, by virtue where-
of the said James Lynch and Mordecai M. Noah were
appointed, was in direct and palpable violation of the
Charter of the city, inasmuch as it, in terms, attempted
to deprive the Aldermen of the city of their rights and
power as Judges of the said Court.
	...
   Resolved, That this meeting fully approve the course
of the Alderman of the ward Moses G. Leonard, Esq., in
refusing to vote for the payment of the salaries of Judges
Lynch and Noah, believing that refusal to be in accor-
dance with the opinions and feelings of the people of
the Ninth Ward, and fully justifiable as a means of de-
fending the charter of the city and the constitution of
the State from further invasions.
   Resolved, That we regard the act of Wm. H. Seward
and the Senate, in removing judges from office without
cause or complaint being preferred against them, for the
purpose of filling their places with the supple tools of
his dictatorial will, as arbitrary and tyrannical, and for
which a precedent can only be found in the despotism
and ignorance of the dark ages.
	...
   Resolved, That the proceedings of this meeting be
published in the Standard, Herald, Post, New Era, Planet
and Sun.</m9>
   <i>These were put and carried unanimously, with loud
cheering</i>.
   Mr. S<small>WACKHAMMER</small>, member of the Legislature,
was then called on to address the meeting. He
said:—
<m9>   “In the object of this meeting, that of sustaining those
supervisors who are opposed to the payment of the sala-
ries of Messrs. Lynch and Noah, I do most heartily con-
cur; and I will use all the honest influence I can to sus-
tain the supervisors, and to drive those men from the
bench; they never ought to have been appointed,
and their salaries never ought to be paid. It is known
	...</m9>
<d>[Col.4]</d>
	...
   The following resolution was then, after some dis-
cussion, carried unanimously:—
<m9>   Resolved, That we, the democrats of the Ninth Ward,
do request Robert H. Morris, the Mayor of this city and
President of the Board of Supervisors, not to vote in that
Board for the payment of the salaries of Judges Lynch
and Noah.</m9>
   Thanks were then voted to the Chairman, and the
meeting adjourned.

   T<small>HE</small> S<small>CENE OF THE</small> M<small>URDER</small>.—An evening paper
says of the inside of this place, “there is not a flat
rock there, not a platform, or even surface, a foot
diameter.” What nonsense; there are three flat
rocks, and at least three persons could sit thereon
conveniently, and we think four could. This print
also says, “It can only be entered on all fours, or
on the hands and knees.” Nonsense again. The
entrance is rather difficult, but any one can enter
flat-footed, who will take the trouble to bend his
back a little, either at the upper or lower entrance.

<d>[Col.6]</d>
   R<small>IOTS AND</small> A<small>RSON IN</small> C<small>INCINNATI</small>.—A<small>TTEMPT TO</small>
B<small>URN A</small> C<small>HURCH</small>.—Yesterday morning, about three
o'clock, an attempt was made to burn the Reformed
Presbyterian Church, on George, between Race
and Elm streets. The incendiaries had taken a
quantity of shavings into the church, which they en-
tered from a back window, placed them in a small
cupboard under the pulpit, and communicated fire
thereto. The people occupying an adjoining house
discovered the flames in time to save the church, and
probably much other property in the neighborhood.
We understand that on Monday night last the win-
dows of this church were broken, no doubt with a
view to further violence. Through the windows
then broken the incendiaries entered.
   A serious riot took place in this city on Tuesday
evening, 14th inst. In the early part of the night in-
formation was given at the watch house of an as-
sault committed on a woman in a disorderly house
on Bank Alley, between Main and Walnut streets.
Some of the watchmen immediately went to pre-
serve the peace, and when in the house they were
attacked, and three of them, Capt. Ewan, Lieute-
nant J. B. Bowlin and Robt. Coppin, wounded; the
last two dangerously, and were insensible at day-
light. Mr. Saffin, the marshal, was as usual, imme-
diately in the discharge of his duty, and proceeded
to arrest the men, who are supposed to be butchers.
They were traced over the canal, and about two
o'clock one man was arrested, after considerable re-
sistance, and making threats to shoot the police with
a pistol he held.—<i>Cincinnati Gazette, Sept.</i> 16.

			<b>Weehawken.</b>
   We give above a beautiful and most accurate re-
presentation of the scenery at Weehawken, in and
around the immediate neighborhood of the murder,
as we promised on a former occasion. In addition
to the exterior view of the thicket, the scene of the
outrage and murder, we here, also, give a represen-
tation of the fields and railings, across which, it is
reasonable to believe, the dead body of Miss Rogers
was carried to the Hudson river; and there either
thrown immediately in, or put into a boat and car-
ried out some distance in the stream, before it was
thrown in. The above view also represents the little
boy at Weehawken, at the miserable rum hole kept
by Stevens on the mud bank, where all the row-
dies usually go in boats on a Sunday. The first
point north of the Elysian Fields is also shown, as is
the second, or Castle Point, off which the body of
Miss Rogers was found. Thus the whole of the
points of scenery connected with the murder are
shown, and their relative positions to the city of
New York, a view of which forms the back ground.
   The above view can be better understood by the
following references: A. is the entrance to the
thicket where the murder was committed. B. is
the old road, now stopped up, running close by the
entrance to the thicket. C. is the lane, or road,
running from Nick Moore's house to <u title="James ?">Jane</u> S. King's
country seat, close by the scene of the murder, and
also Bull's Ferry. D. is the rum hole on the mud
bank. E. is the north point of the Elysian Fields.
F. is Castle Point, off which the body was found.
G. is the spot at the edge of the river, below Lud-
low's, where the boat lay in which it is believed the
dead body of Mary Rogers was carried into the
stream. Such is a correct view of the whole of the
neighborhood, and the scenes of interest connected
with this horrible tragedy, as far as they have yet
come to light; and this completes the series of views
connected with the murder.
   Who that ever read the following <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=H7kRAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA397">beautiful lines</a>
on <u title="Weehawken">Weekawken</u>, by Halleck, would ever have sup-
posed it could have been the scene of so horrible a
tragedy:—
<m9 id="Herald-1841-09-24-Weehawken-by-Halleck">	Weehawken! In <u title="thy">they</u> mountain scenery yet,
	  All we adore of nature in her wild
	And frolic hour of infancy, is met;
	  And never has a summer's morning smiled
	Upon a lovelier scene, than<u title="when (elsewhere)"> </u>the full eye
	Of the enthusiast revels on—when high

	Amid thy forest solitudes, he climbs
	  O'er crags, that proudly tower above the deep,
	And knows that sense of danger which sublimes
	  The breathless moment—when his daring step
	Is on the verge of the cliff, and he can hear
	The low dash of the wave with startled ear,

	Like the death-music of his coming doom,
	  And clings to the green turf with desperate force,
	As the heart clings to life; and when resume
	  The currents in his veins their wonted course,
	There lingers a deep feeling—like the moan
	Of wearied ocean, when the storm is gone.

	In such an hour he turns, and on his view,
	  Ocean, and earth, and heaven, burst before him;
	Clouds slumbering at his feet, and the clear blue
	  Of summer's sky in beauty bending o'er him—
	The city bright below; and far away,
	Sparkling in golden light, his own romantic bay.

	Tall spire, and glittering roof, and battlement,
	  And banners floating in the sunny air;
	And white sails o'er the calm blue waters bent,
	  Green isle, and <u title="circling">cirling</u> shore, are blended there
	In wild reality. When life is old,
	And many a scene forgot, the heart will hold

	Its memory of this; nor lives there one
	  Whose infant breath was drawn, or boyhood's days
	Of happiness were pass'd beneath that sun,
	  That in his manhood's prime can calmly gaze
	Upon that bay, or on that mountain stand,
	Nor feel the prouder of his native land.</m9>
   Beautiful as are these lines, they are no less true
than beautiful; they have always given a tenfold
interest to the scenery around Weehawken, which
the late horrible affair will heighten rather than di-
minish. It is worse than idle on the part of many
persons who ought to know better, to attempt to
throw a doubt over the locality of the murder of this
poor girl. It was undoubtedly done at Weehaw-
ken. The spot already described as the thicket, is
comparatively close to the river. The route from
it to the river can be travelled even in the day time,
frequently without meeting a single soul, much more
in the night. The spot is just an one as would be
selected for such a murder. After dark, it frequently
happens that not a soul passes that place by the
hour together. A thousand persons may pass the
spot even now, and not notice it. Even if all the
articles once belonging to Mary Rogers, that were
recently found there, were to be replaced within
that thicket, with three times as many, we might
wager any sum with perfect safety, that at least a
thousand persons might pass and repass that spot in
broad daylight, and never notice one of the articles,
unless they were pointed out to him or her. Indeed,
it is perfectly impossible that any one could see
them till they reached the inside of the thicket, so
closely and densely intertwined are the leaves and
branches around there. So much, then, for the silly
statement that the articles must have been recently
put there, or they would have been discovered be-
fore.
   With regard to another statement that has gone
abroad, that no one young woman would have gone
in there voluntarily, that amounts to nothing.—
Whether Miss Rogers went in there of her own ac-
cord with the young man who was with her, or
whether she did not, is a matter of very little mo-
ment, as far as the fact of her being there is con-
cerned. We have, it is true, once or twice, for a
moment supposed it possible that she did go there of
her own free will, or by persuasion, with the young
man who was with her; that whilst seated there
talking, or taking shelter from the rain, or other-
wise, they were discovered by the rowdies, who
murdered both. But this is mere surmise. The
more probable view is, that she, and the young man
who was at Mrs. Loss's with her, were coming
down the grassy middle road; that he was knocked
down senseless, and she was seized; that she then
screamed, and was heard by Mrs. Loss; then was
<d>[Col.4]</d>
chocked till she was senseless, and dragged into this
thicket out of the way, on the approach of Mrs.
Loss. And the body of a man might lay on the
grass road at dusk, and a person pass along the low-
er road, and never notice it, or see it. Or the young
man who was with her might on that very road have
been attempting to take liberties with her; she re-
sisted and screamed; he choked her, dragged her
into the thicket, and there violated and murdered
her. Then stayed by the dead and mangled body of
his victim, in that dark thicket, with no eye but that
of God upon the murderer and the murdered maid,
until all was still—perhaps till near midnight. Then,
tying the frock around her to form a handle, he car-
ried her to the river, and hurled her in, and fled, too
horror stricken to think of returning to the scene of
the murder, to remove the articles found by the
boys.
   Who that young man was, yet remains to be as-
certained. The probability is, that neither his or
her murderers will be discovered until that great
day of reckoning for the sons and daughters of men,
when the just and the unjust shall stand in the pre-
sence of Him who made them, there to give an ac-
count of the deeds done in the body.

<d>[Col.6]</d>
   A<small>NOTHER</small> O<small>UTRAGE AND PROBABLY</small> M<small>URDER</small>.—On Wed-
nesday afternoon as a woman in employment of Mrs.
J. Kenney, who keeps a feather store in Hudson street,
was passing through Hudson street, on her way to the
store, with a heavy bundle of picked hair for <u title="mattresses">mattrasses</u>
on her back, she was met by three young rowdies. One
of them made a jump on her back which brought her on
the side walk with great force. The cries of the poor
woman brought a number of persons to her assistance.
She was taken up and found to be very much hurt; a
cab was procured and she was conveyed to her residence
in Beach street. Two or three medical gentlemen were
immediately in attendance, and on examination, the spine
of the back was found to be broken, and the woman oth-
erwise severely injured. So much so, that the physi-
cians deemed it necessary to have her conveyed to the
Hospital. The fellows immediately made off, after they
saw what mischief they had done.
   T<small>RIAL OF</small> J<small>USTICE</small> P<small>ARKER</small>.—The County Court orga-
nized, but, on motion of Alderman Benson, immediately
adjourned to this day at 4 P. M.
			———————
   O<small>UTRAGE IN THE</small> C<small>APITOL</small> G<small>ARDEN</small>.—We have just
been informed by Mr. Mather, the public gardener,
that in the course of Monday night, some ill dispos-
ed persons went into the beautiful garden attached
to the Capitol, and destroyed a great number of va-
luable plants and flowers, such as cabbage roses, &c.
Besides acting in this outrageous manner, the vil-
lains cut and carried away not less than 1500 of the
choice dahlias which have been raised with so much
care, and which were so beautiful and ornamental
to the public grounds.—<i>National Intelligencer</i>.

<b>The New York Herald—Its Position—Its
			Character.</b>
   We have the pleasure of announcing to our nu-
merous readers in America and Europe, that this
journal has now reached a position in the world
above all opposition—and a character—a moral one,
too—for early and accurate intelligence, that out-
strips every thing of the kind ever known in this
busy world. The wars are all over—we are at peace
with the whole world, and we can contemplate our
triumphs with pride and gratification—with full
pockets, and a fine young son that, at the age of four
months, can pronounce words of one syllable.
   The position, the reputation, and the accuracy of
the Herald, are acknowledged in all quarters. Let us
give a brief <i>résumé</i> of the evidence on these points.
   1st. A grave convention of highly respectable
whig members of Congress have acknowledged, in
their late “address” to the people, that the New
York Herald discovered and published the state se-
crets of the government before the members of the
late cabinet did it themselves, and that they had to
resort to the columns of the Herald for the most cor-
rect and accurate views of the President. [N. B.
Such blockheads were not fit for any cabinet.]
   2d. A retiring cabinet minister, called by the
name of the Hon. Thomas Ewing, very properly ad-
mits, in a long letter to the President, that the se-
crets of their consultations were published in the
Herald as soon as the intelligence could reach New
York by express—and this same distinguished states-
man is so generous as to allow, in a grave public do-
cument, that he had to resort to our columns as to
the accurate exponent of the President's mind.
Great times for small potatoes these!
   3d. The “National Intelligencer,” a highly re-
spectable print, published on the everlasting credit
system, in Washington City, states, substantially,
that their attention was first called to the Herald,
from the early and accurate intelligence of the
movements of the cabinet, which its columns con-
tained—and that to the remarkable intellectual in-
fluence of the Herald is the country indebted for the
suicide of the late cabinet, and the appointment of
a new and better one.
   4th. The “Courier and Enquirer,” published in
Wall street, hitherto considered the organ of the
whig party, and the confidential avenue of a whig
President to the public, acknowledges itself com-
pletely out-generalled by the superior diplomacy of
the Herald, and freely admits that this journal is
the “organ of the Executive in New York”—the
“Court Journal” of the President of the United
States—and the favorite journal of the New York
University Medical School, besides been the repre-
sentative of all the other new and interesting move-
ments of the day.
   5th. The “New York American”—the “New
York Evening Star”—the “Albany Evening Jour-
nal”—the “Richmond Whig”—the “Boston Atlas”
—and all the leading so-called whig papers, admit
the same facts, and give evidence of the same cha-
racter. Indeed the “New York American” goes
father in its kindness, and admits, without a quali-
fication, that the first intelligence of the recent po-
litical events in this country, the vetoes, the cabinet
explosion, &c. was communicated to the reading
rooms of London and Liverpool, from the Herald
office, by a sort of electro-magnetic power, which
we alone possess, that enables us to look into futu-
rity, and to predict events to take place, as accu-
rately as he that guides them.
	...
   The circulation of this journal is accordingly com-
mensurate with its reputation. Our aggregate circu-
lation, in Europe and America, is now over THIRTY
THOUSAND COPIES, and calculating that each
paper is read by <i>ten persons</i>, it gives a total of
THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND persons in all
ranks of society, from the President of the United
States, and Louis Philippe of France, down to the
lowliest and steadiest mechanic, that read, study,
and feel with the spirit, facts, and doctrines of the
New York Herald. This vast number of readers
forms, with us, a centre and a distribution of thought,
in the midst of civilization, in finance, politics, mo-
rals and religion, and must have a great and good
effect on the progress of society and the improve-
ment of the present century.
   Our vast newspaper system is, therefore, doing for
the soul and intellect of the masses, what the dis-
coveries in steam, electricity, and magnetism are
doing for the great physical movements of the age.
The crooked paths are made straight—and the long
ones short—the highways and byways of “th' olden
time” are abandoned, and every thing is new, bright,
and auspicious.
   And thus we define the position of the Herald.

   E<small>XPERIMENTAL</small> T<small>RIP OF THE</small> <u title="KAMCHATKA">K<small>AMSCHATKA</small></u>.—The
Russian steam frigate went down the bay yester-
day, on an experimental trip. She started from the
North river at ten o'clock in the forenoon, and re-
turned in the evening, a little after six o'clock. She
proved to be a sea ship of the first order, and of great
speed. About forty-five miles were run over, and
her average speed was ten miles an hour. She
started with eight inches of steam, and ran up to ten
and a half. Her speed against a head wind, with
yards squared, and a head tide, of three to four
miles, was nine knots per hour. No steam ship ever
rode so easy, so steady, and so gracefully as did the
<u>Kamschatka</u> on this trial trip. Not the slightest jar
was felt. Every one on board, including M. Bodis-
co, the Russian Minister, and the Belgium Minister,
expressed themselves as highly pleased and satisfied
with this, the first big American steam ship ever
built. More anon.

   T<small>HE</small> S<small>ALARIES OF THE</small> J<small>UDGES OF THE</small> S<small>ES-
SIONS</small>.—The question before the Board of Supervi-
sors, yesterday, related to the propriety of paying
the salaries of Judges Noah and Lynch. It was
contended by those opposed to paying them, that
the law under which they were made judges was
unconstitutional, and inconsistent with the city
charter; that the services of the judges were not
required, and that, inasmuch as they had already
appealed to the supreme court to decide the ques-
tion, it were better to let the matter come to an issue
in that way. This was the ground taken by all the
democratic members of the Board, except the
Mayor and Alderman Pollock, who voted conscien-
tiously with the other side.
   The Mayor said, in explanation of his vote, that
although he was strongly opposed to the law crea-
ting the Judges, he thought the legislature had a
right to pass it, and an unjust and oppressive as it
might be, the laws were only to be resisted in a le-
gal way. The legislature had been empowered to
establish Courts, and as the Court in dispute had
been made by the exercise of a rightful authority,
much as he detested the spirit and manner of the
act, he felt bound to acquiesce. Nothing could be
hoped from either the Supreme Court or the Court
of Errors, whose decisions on such a point any body
might easily anticipate.
   The Board meet again to-day, when it is sup-
posed an order will be passed to pay the salaries
of the Judges.

this planet is not an inhabited body, and that it is
without any kind of vitality, either animal or vege-
table. He denies, also, that it has either seas, riv-
ers, or lakes, but admits that it has mountains and
valleys, which, however, he says, are of primitive
formation.

   “<u title="KAMCHATKA">K<small>AMSCHATKA</small></u>,” <small>THE</small> R<small>USSIAN</small> S<small>TEAM</small> F<small>RIGATE</small>.—
We stated yesterday, that this war steamer made
an experimental trip down the Bay last Thursday.
She left her anchorage, opposite Jersey City, at ten
o'clock in the morning, run up the river about three
miles, turned, and steamed to Sandy Hook, and a
few miles outside. In all, she run over forty-four
miles of water, and returned to the city at half-past
six in the evening. She was piloted by Mr. Vos-
<s title="(from Hazard's Register, October 6, 1841)">burg</s>, of the “New York.”
   A small and select party of ladies and gentlemen
accompanied her. M. de Bodisco, the Russian
Minister, and the Belgium Minister, were among
the number.
   This trip was purely experimental, and made pre-
paratory to the final departure of the steamer, early
next week, for Cronstadt. It proved highly satisfac-
tory; and it is now ascertained that in speed, the
“<u>Kamschatka</u>” is not equalled by any sea steamer
now floating on the Atlantic Ocean, or the Pacific,
or the Indian, or the Black Sea, or the Baltic.
   When she started, she displaced 2,468 tons, and
consequently drew a good deal of water. She had
eight inches of steam on, and in running up the ri-
ver her wheels made ten revolutions per minute,
against a three knot tide. And in coming down the
Bay, the steam <u title="gauge">guage</u> went up to ten and a half
inches, and the revolutions reached ten to ten and a
half per minute. Her speed was then nine miles
per hour, against a head wind, with yards squared,
and a two to three knot tide, which made her actu-
al speed to be at least twelve miles an hour! This
was produced by the use of anthracite coal exclu-
sively. Had bituminous coal been burned, greater
would have been speed. It must here be borne in
mind, that this was the first trip of the steamer, and
that her machinery had never before been used.
   At one point in the Bay, where the wind was fa-
vorable, part of her sails were unfurled, and then
she made about thirteen miles per hour. She per-
formed this distance easily, notwithstanding the es-
cape of some steam, which will hereafter be saved,
by the expansion of the pipes and valves. We think
that when a vessel, displacing 2,468 tons, with every
thing about her new and untried, succeeds in mov-
ing through the water at the rate of twelve miles, or
even nine miles per hour, she must be perfect in mo-
del and line.
   Her consumption of coal averaged at the rate of
twenty seven tons only per day, and she can therefore
carry one month's supply with no inconvenience
whatever. She burns the anthracite without the use of
blowers, which are used in many steamers burning
the same kind of fuel. This is a great improvement
and an immense saving. We do not believe that
ever a steamer had so cool engine rooms as the
“<u>Kamschatka</u>.” In any part of them, over the boil-
ers, or close to the fires, the air is cool, and the
rooms very light. Indeed, near the fires the draft is
so strong that it blows the lights out. When full
steam is on a person can go all over the iron grated
floors, around and about the boilers and cylinders,
and inspect every piece of machinery almost as
easily and comfortably, and as conveniently, and
as coolly, as they can paintings or statuary on shore,
and perhaps with equal pleasure, too. On Thursday
ladies visited the engine rooms while the machinery
was in motion, walked all around, and came out de-
lighted, and as clean as when they went in. We
must say that the cleanness and neatness of the whole
vessel is remarkable. There is none of that dirty,
dingy appearance, which is characteristic of steam-
ers burning bituminous coal—particularly of Eng-
lish steamers.
   One of the principal features of the “<u>Kamschat-
ka</u>” is the steadiness, and easy, swanlike motion,
with which she moves through the water. There is
no jar, no disagreeable noise, arising from the ma-
chinery—all is quiet and firm. Standing on the deck,
persons do not feel as if the entire fabric beneath
them was tumbling to pieces. They feel safe and
secure.
   To describe her as she ought to be described would
take several columns, there are so many improve-
ments in her model and her machinery. When she
passed between the “North Carolina” and “La
Belle Poule,” the officers of those vessels were on
their decks, and they remarked, particularly the
French, the beauty of her model and rig, and the
neat and nimble wheels as they ploughed through
the water. These wheels have been constructed on
a new plan, giving to an apparently slight wheel great
strength and increased power of propulsion.
   Her engines are of six hundred horse power, and
her tonnage about two thousand. The proportion of
steam power to size is not far from one horse to three
and one-third tons, which is considered the best for
speed. The principle on which her engines are work-
ed is called the triangular. The piston moves hori-
zontally, and the connecting rod is on an incline of
about sixty degrees. The air pump is worked verti-
cally by a crank connected with the beam shaft.
   All the machinery is of the most superb kind, fin-
ished in a masterly manner, and made entirely of
Livingston iron. Her four large boilers are made of
American copper, and there is not a bit of foreign
metal about her. Her cylinders weigh ten tons each,
and were the largest ever cast in this country, and
her shafts were the heaviest cast at the time of their
casting.
   There is one feature in her machinery which ought
not to be overlooked. That which turnes the wheels
is new, and possesses greater power, and gives greater
steadiness, than any we have ever seen. It has three
joints, like the wrist, elbow, and shoulder of a man's
arm. Those on our steamers have only two joints,
hence the superiority of the propellors of the Rus-
sian steamer. There is no jerk about them.
   Connected with the engine is an apparatus with
which the magazine, and in fact the whole vessel,
could be flooded with water in a very short time, so
there is no danger of being burnt up.
   The station for the Chief Engineer is so construct-
ed that from one place he can manage and overlook
the whole, and tell in an instant when a neglect of
duty occurs.
   Her hull is black, with splendid turned and pointed
bows, and round stern, each surmounted with a
large double-headed gilt eagle. She is rigged like
a ship. She will spread as much canvass as either
the England or Sheffield packet ships. Her spar
deck is flush fore and aft, and gives a clean run of
240 feet. On this are placed four <u title="Paixhans (elsewhere)">Paixham</u> bomb
cannons. Two are to throw shells of 96 pounds
weight, and two 64 pounds. Above these is the
hurricane deck, which runs across from wheel house
to wheel house. Connected with this is an awning,
which completely covers the spar <u title="deck">dack</u>. Around
the wheel houses are erected places for the painters,
carpenters, stewards, boat keepers, closets for the
sailors, as we mentioned last July. Aft are several
splendid state rooms, intended for the Emperor, and
other high officers. To each state room is attached
a small room for servants. Four boats are suspended
upon the davits, and hang even with the deck.
   On her forward gun deck are ten port holes, out
of which run ten 36 pounders, mounted on mas-
sive carriages, made of African oak, and brass
mounted. This deck is spacious, light and airy, and
is shut from the after section of the same deck by
sliding or folding doors. These close just forward
of where the cook has an immense cooking appara-
tus, which is laid on the marble for the sake of neat-
ness, durability and safety. Directly astern of this,
runs up the funnel 45 feet, with a rake on a line
with the rake of the masts, and the hoops around it
beveling with the tops. This gives uniformity to
the appearance of the vessel. This funnel is seven
feet in diameter. Aft of it is the machinery which
runs down to the kelson, and is laid on copper.
   Under her forward gun deck are the boatswain's
store rooms, magazine, medicine rooms, clerk's of-
fice, gunner's apartments, mess rooms for the sai-
lors, and places for them to sleep, keep their clo-
thing, and stow away their hammocks—and for
compactness and comfort we never saw their like.
   Her cabins and drawing rooms are magnificent.
Her main cabin, the farthest astern, is large, the
whole width of the ship, high, spacious, and neatly
fitted up with settees, stuffed with hair, and covered
with haircloth. This cabin will carry six 36 pound-
ers, and they always remain therein ready for use.
Forward are two drawing rooms, fitted up in the
most splendid style, and are intended for the impe-
rial family. The wood work of these rooms con-
sists of mahogany, bird's eye maple, rose and satin
wood, and presents a very fine appearance. Beneath
these are the ward room, and cabins for the officers,
and around are cool pantries and closets, and also
the steward's bar and ample storage room.
   For strength her hull is not surpassed by any ves-
sel afloat. She has iron straps innumerable, and
knees and cross knees beneath every deck.
   Such is the “<u>Kamschatka</u>.” Her model was
drafted and her line drawn and calculated by Cap-
tain Von <u title="Schantz">Shantz</u> of the Russian Navy, and Captain
Pepin of the Russian Naval Engineer Corps, assisted
by Lieutenants <u title="Scheronbine, Sherburne (elsewhere)">Scharoubine</u> of the Engineer Corps,
and Flotoff of the Navy. And never has so perfect a
model been presented to the public. Her line, as
calculated, has come out precisely, and her speed
fully, if not more than equal to expectation. And
her machinery, which was constructed by Messrs.
Schuyler of Jersey City, after plans of their own, and
of the Russian officers, is an honor to this country.
Its workmanship is superb, and its action beautiful,
easy and satisfactory. It was all put up under the
superintendence of Mr. Scott, an American, who
goes to Russia in the steamer in the capacity of
chief engineer. Her hull was built by Wm. Brown,
the largest steamboat builder in this city. As a spe-
cimen, no better can possibly be sent abroad. She
is the cheapest vessel of the kind we ever heard of,
and her cost is $200,000 less than either that of the
<d>[Col.4]</d>
“Missouri” or the “Mississippi,” the two steam
frigates recently built for our government.
   What a reflection she casts upon our merchants.
Here is a vessel, the finest in the world, built in this
city by American shipwrights and American mach-
inists, at an expense of only $400,000, and of speed
unequalled. What a commentary it is too, for the
genius of this country to be brought out by the Czar
of Russia! If our merchants had formed a company
two years ago, with a capital of $1,200,000, they
might now have four steam ships, of the size and di-
mensions of the “<u>Kamschatka</u>,” crossing the Atlantic
in ten days, outstripping every other steamer, and ever
ready to enter the service of the United States in the
event of a war. But they have chosen to let Empe-
ror Nicholas teach them that “some things can be
done as well as others” in the United States.
   In conclusion, we have a word to say respecting
the Russian naval officers. They will leave us in a
few days, and we cannot, therefore, lose this oppor-
tunity.
   Within the last ten years great progress has been
made in Russia in the arts and sciences, and every
exertion made by the Emperor for the advancement
and improvement of his people. He has left no
stone unturned, and about three years ago he des-
patched Captain Pepin and Lieut. <u title="Scharoubine, Sherburne (elsewhere)">Scheronbine</u>, of
the naval engineer corps, to England, for the pur-
pose of learning every thing in relation to steam na-
vigation, rail roads, dry docks and ship yards, and
to take drawings thereof. Not meeting with much
success in that country, they wrote home to the
Emperor to that effect. He instantly sent them an
order to “go to America.” They arrived here
about two years since, and travelled north, south,
east and west, and also to Texas. They visited
every ship yard, every naval station, every dry dock,
every ship and every steamer in the country. Their
gentlemanly deportment made them friends where-
ver they went. They have been cordially received
from the President down—every facility was afforded
them, and the result is, they have in their <i title="portefeuille">porte feuille</i>
plans and drawings of docks and steamers, and steam
engines, and locomotives and spile drivers to the
number of three hundred and over. All these they
drew with their own hands, and a more valuable
collection is not owned by any other government.
After taking them they received instructions to at-
tach themselves to the “<u>Kamschatka</u>,” and assist
Captain Von <u title="Schantz">Shantz</u> in her construction.
   With such officers, as the four named above, the
Emperor has reason to feel proud of his navy.

writes us from Otsego, Sept. 18th, as follows:—
   Your very worthy and moral friend Park Benjamin
has, no doubt, <i>them</i> $375 ready to fork over, on that
judgment which J. <u title="Fenimore">Fennimore</u> Cooper obtained
against him for libel, at the sitting of the Circuit
Court at Cooperstown this week, Judge Gridley
presiding. Cooper's counsel, the Hon. S. S. Bowne,
M. C. from this district, in summing up the cause,
read paragraphs from Benjamin's own paper, in
which he denounces you as a libeller, and goes on
to depict, in glowing colors, the infamy of such a
character. Mr. B. considered Park's own effusions
as sufficient reasons why the jury should immerse
him in exemplary damages after having the libel
fully proved against him. So did the jury. So the
world goes.

   <i>The Mary Rogers Affair.</i>—Although the
actors in this horrible tragedy have not been
discovered, some facts have come to light
which define the site of the murder with plaus-
ible accuracy. It appears, from <a class="l" href="#Herald-1841-09-17-Col3">a statement</a>
published in the Herald, that Mary Rogers
was seen to cross the ferry on the day
of the murder, by Adam, a stage driver,
who recognised her. She was accompanied
by a dark complexioned young man. She
was afterwards seen by Mrs. Loss, who
keeps a house, formerly occupied by Nick
Moore, at the foot of <u title="Weehawken">Weekawken</u> Heights.
Mrs. Loss's attention was particularly called
to her in consequence of her wearing a dress
similar to one worn by a deceased relative.
She was afterwards seen about a mile beyond
the hotel, on the heights. In the evening,
after dark, Mrs. Loss had occasion to send
her child, Oscar, to drive a bull home. Soon
after he was gone, she heard dreadful screams
and cries, which sounded like 'Oh! Oh!
God!' She was frightened for the child,
thinking the bull had tossed him, and rushed
out. She then heard a stifled, suffering
scream, and all was still. She found her
boy safe, and thought no more of the matter,
further, than supposing it was some fight <u>of
of</u> the drunken rowdies in the habit of coming
over on Sundays, and who, on that day, were
there in great numbers. On the 25th ult.,
her boys were out collecting sassafras bark,
and penetrating a small thicket, discovered
the identical scarf worn by the young lady at
Mrs. Loss's on the night of the murder, also
a parasol, and a pocket <u title="handkerchief">handkercheif</u>, marked
with Mary Rogers's name, and other articles
of dress. The conclusion drawn is, that
Mary Rogers and her attendant were belated
in consequence of the rain, and in passing
this thicket were set upon by some of the
rowdies, and probably both murdered.—
There yet remains the man to be accounted
for. Has his body been found, or has he
not been murdered, or is her so terrified, lest
he should be considered the murderer, that he
has not dared to come forward? He may
do so with safety, for the circumstantial evi-
dence points to the bloody act as the work of
a gang and not an individual.

	MOST HORRIBLE MURDER
   Our city has again been the theatre of a most
startling and murderous tragedy. Though less
horrible in its details than the hideous outrage and
murder of Miss Mary Rogers, it yet awakens in the
public mind as deep a thrill of dread excitement
and indignation by its black atrocity, as did that
terrible event. We give below all the well au-
thenticated circumstances which have come to
light respecting it.
   Our readers may remember that on Friday the
<u title="17th">19th</u> inst. Mr. Samuel Adams, printer at the corner
of Ann and Gold streets, residing at 11 Elizabeth
street, was missed from his home and that from that
day no trace of him could be found. He was said
to have called on that day at the office of the Mis-
sionary Herald where he stated his intention of
going to a store in Canal street, which he never
reached. <a class="l" href="#Tribune-1841-09-22-Col3">A notice of his disappearance</a> was pub-
lished on Wednesday last in the Tribune and copi-
ed in various papers with a request that any one
who had seen or heard of him would give informa-
tion thereof to his friends. This notice called forth
the following narration given to the Mayor by Mr.
Wheeler, teacher of a writing academy in a room
in the second story of the large granite building on
the northwest corner of Chambers street and Broad-
way. His room is in the corner, looking into both
Broadway and Chambers street; next to it is the
room of a Mr. J. C. Colt, the author of a work on
Book-keeping, and brother of the well known in-
ventor of repeating firearms. In this room on the
Friday afternoon of Mr. Adams's disappearance,
at about 4 o'clock Mr. Wheeler, who was engaged
with his pupils, heard a scuffle which lasted for a
few moments and was followed by the fall of a
heavy body upon the floor. All noise instantly
ceased.
   Thinking this somewhat singular, Mr. Wheeler
left his room, knocked several times at Colt's door,
but received no answer. He tried to get in, but
found the door locked. He then looked in at the
key-hole, and saw two hats upon the table, and a
man, whom from his dress and appearance he
judged to be Colt, busily engaged apparently in
washing the floor. He retired for a considerable
time, and, on returning, saw the same thing, Colt
being still engaged upon the floor. He requested
one of his pupils, whom he also <u title="employs">employes</u> as an as-
sistant teacher, to watch until Colt should go out.
The young man remained all night, and, on look-
ing, saw Colt similarly employed at several differ-
ent times. Early in the morning he saw Colt set
outside his door a box about four feet square, di-
rected to some person at “St. Louis via New-Or-
leans.” Colt then went out and soon returned;
shortly after a carman came and took away the
box, Colt going with him. The young man
watched no farther, but reported these occurrences
to Mr. Wheeler, who supposed the box to contain
some of Colt's property, which it was thought he
intended to remove, and thought little farther of
it. A day or two afterward, however, Wheeler
got into Colt's room, and saw several places which
had apparently been severely scrubbed and then
smeared with ink; he found, also, a broken look-
ing-glass and a hatchet, the handle of which had
been scraped and covered with ink. There were
also upon the wall spots of the same liquid.
   On Wednesday morning, seeing a notice of Mr.
Adams's disappearance, and being suspicious, from
knowing that Colt was indebted to Adams, that his
mysterious absence might be connected with the
noise he had heard and the appearances he had
noticed, he gave information of them to Mr. Mayor
M<small>ORRIS</small>, who forthwith commenced an investiga-
tion, which he has continued with most laudable
zeal and activity. In company with Justice Tay-
lor of the Upper Police, and Police Officers A. M.
C. Smith and Walker, whose efforts have also
been highly praiseworthy during the whole pro-
gress of the inquiry, he took the testimony of Mr.
Wheeler and his assistant. On Friday he sent
officers Smith and Walker to arrest Colt. They
found his room locked, and went into one adjacent.
They had been there but a short time when Colt
came in, went to his door, and with a key was
about entering it, when officer Smith sprang upon
and seized him, telling him that 'he wanted him.'
Colt asked him 'what for,' and Smith answered
that he would tell him directly. He was brought
before the Mayor, and on being interrogated, said
that he was not at his room on the Friday night
referred to, and denied all knowledge of any box
having left his room. He was, however, commit-
ted for farther examination.
   On Saturday the Mayor advertised for the car-
man who took away the box, and directed Wil-
liam F. Godfrey, Superintendent of Hacks and
Carts, to endeavor to discover him. Mr. Godfrey
immediately addressed himself to his task, and
found a carman named Russel, who came wil-
lingly before the Mayor and testified that on the
Saturday previous he was employed and paid by
Colt for taking the box, directed as mentioned
above, to the ship Kalamazoo, lying at the foot of
Maiden Lane. He further testified that Colt ac-
companied him and took a receipt for the delivery of
the box on board. Upon learning this the Mayor,
with his officers, went on board the vessel, which
was about to sail, learned from the Mate the same
facts that had been stated by Russell, and took im-
mediate measures to detain the ship. Yesterday
the hatches were opened in presence of the Mayor,
and at 1 o'clock, P. M. the box was found in the
forward hold of the ship and placed upon deck.
It was there opened; upon the top was a piece of
sail-cloth, beneath which, sprinkled with salt and
chloride of lime, was a dead body. The box was
immediately closed and taken to the dead-house,
and there locked up.
   At 3 o'clock the Coroner's jury was summoned,
and at half-past 3 the box was brought into their
presence and a post-mortem examination executed
upon the body by Drs. Gilman, Kissam and others.
The body, when taken out, had no clothing upon
it but a shirt. Around the neck was tightly fast-
ened a thick cord, which was passed down in front
and tied about the knee-joints, thus drawing them
up close upon the breast. At the bottom of the
box was a black coat without pocket-flaps or <u title="lapels">lap-
pels</u>, and considerably torn, and a neck stock,
across which was a cut. Upon these, wrapped
about with a piece of sail-cloth, and bits of oakum
and other rubbish, was the body, doubled up as
above mentioned and tightly crowded down.
   The body upon examination was found to be in
a state of advance decomposition; the whole
frontal bone of the forehead, with part of the tem-
porale bone, was beaten in upon the brain; the
right parietal bone was likewise fractured, and the
left separated from the rest of the skull and driven
completely in upon the brain. One cheek bone
<d>[Col.4]</d>
was fractured, and there was a deep wound in the
back of the head. There was also a cut upon the
side of the chin which matched perfectly with the
cut in the stock. Upon a finger on the right hand
was a small ring. The features were so entirely
decayed and the countenance so disfigured that
the body could not well be identified; but Mrs.
Adams testified that as nearly as she could judge
from the ring and coat, the body is that of her hus-
band. A scar upon the leg is also a mark of iden-
tification. A watch, known to have belonged to
Mr. Adams, as he repeatedly attempted to sell it,
has been found in the trunk of Colt at his lodgings
in Monroe-street, near Market.
   Colt is known to have been indebted to Adams
to a considerable amount for printing his work on
book-keeping, and it is understood that the latter
had had some trouble in securing his pay. Colt
was about to ship a box of his books to Philadel-
phia and employed a third person to do this and to
receive the money for them in his stead. This third
person, we understand, was told by Adams that
the money for the books was to be paid to him as
Colt was in his debt. The former mentioned this
to Colt who denied it, and said he himself must
receive the money. On meeting Adams, on the
fatal Friday, the third person told him what was
said by Colt, and remarked that he was sure Colt
meant to cheat him of his money. Adams re-
marked that he should take care of that as he
meant to see Colt about it. He was last seen that
day going up Broadway, near the corner of Cham-
bers-street.
   At a late hour last night the Coroner's jury re-
turned as their verdict that the body was that of
Mr. Samuel Adams, and that, in their belief, he
came to his death by blows inflicted by J. C. Colt.
   The above are all the material facts that have
come to our knowledge concerning this most atro-
cious murder. They carry with them their own
comment. Mr. Adams was originally from Pro-
vidence. His parents are both dead, but most of
his relatives still live in that city. He had a wife
but no children. He came to this city some seven
or eight years since, and worked for a while as jour-
neyman printer. Soon afterward he entered into
partnership with a Scotchman named <u title="Scatcherd">Scatchard</u>,
and under the name of <a class="e" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=p9oRAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA487"><u title="Scatcherd and Adams">Scatchard & Adams</u></a>, they
carried on business together as job and book prin-
ters. His partner soon died and he continued the
business in his own name. He lost nearly all his
property, partly by fire and partly by the failure of
those who owed him, and was in debt some $5000
at the time of his death. He was an honest, in-
dustrious, temperate and religious man, highly re-
spected by all who knew him. His age was not
far from 35.

<b>Shocking Murder of Mr. Adams, the Print-
   er—The Body Discovered on board a Ves-
   sel—Arrest of the Supposed Murderer.</b>
   It will be remembered that we stated last week
that Mr. Samuel Adams, of the firm of <u>Scatchard</u> &
Adams, printers, 59 Gold street, was missing. He
was last seen alive at the office of the “Missionary
Herald,” about 4 or 5 on the afternoon of Friday,
Sept. 17th, where he went to take a proof. It was
rumored that he was met by an acquaintance in
Broadway about 5 P. M. that afternoon, who said to
him, “Colt is going to leave the city.” To which
he is said to have replied “Is he, then I'll go and
get the money he owes me from him.” He went
then, it is said, in the direction of Colt's place of bu-
siness, which is the second story of the granite build-
ings, corner of Chambers street and Broadway. The
Colt here spoken of is J. C. Colt, author of a “Trea-
tise on Book-keeping,” and brother of Mr. Colt, the
celebrated inventor of the repeating rifles and pis-
tols.
   It appears that on the evening of Adams's disap-
pearance, the occupants of the upper stories of the
large granite building, corner of Broadway and
Chambers street, were disturbed by a mysterious noise
and scuffling in the room of J. C. Colt. A gentleman
named Wheeler, teacher of penmanship, occupying
a room adjoining Colt's, suspecting foul play, look-
ed through the key hole of Colt's door and saw Colt
washing the floor. At a late hour, looking again,
he saw him similarly occupied. He ordered his
young man to watch until Colt went out. Colt stay-
ed all night in his room and was constantly employ-
ed. In the morning, Colt went out and called a
carman, to whom he delivered a box of sufficient
size to hold a man, directed to some one at St.
Louis via New Orleans. The young man re-
ported the circumstances to his employer. The
gentleman alluded to, some time afterwards seeing
the advertisement of the mysterious disappearance
of Mr. Adams, made some inquiries, and ascertain-
ed that Mr. A. was then executing (or had previous-
ly executed) printing for Colt to a considerable
amount, and was in the habit of often calling at
Colt's rooms. This confirmed his suspicions that
foul murder had been done on the Friday night
above named—and he communicated the whole
circumstances to Mayor Morris. Colt was arrested
on Thursday last, and on being questioned then, de-
nied all knowledge of the affair, or that he was in
the room that night. The room is on the second
story, facing Chambers street, and the second room
from Broadway.
   We have also learned from another quarter that
on the night of Friday, the 17th inst., the gentleman
occupying the adjoining room, with others, heard a
noise of some person falling, and fancied some
persons were fencing with foils, and one of them had
fallen. The parties waited, expecting to hear a
laugh, but from that moment a most profound and
deathlike silence followed. Surprised at the cir-
cumstance, the gentleman knocked several times at
Colt's door, but no answer was given.
   On the following morning, a large box was ob-
served by many of the inmates of the granite build-
ing, standing in the entry. Some in the upper part
of the building thought at first that it was for them,
as it was about the length to contain two full sized
busts. Observing, however, that it was directed to
St. Louis via New Orleans, they saw that it was
going from the building, not that it had come to it.
Other persons in the building, who knew that Colt
had only taken the rooms for a short time, thought
he was removing. The box was removed between
half past 8 and 10 A. M., on Saturday, the 18th.
   The gentleman who heard the noise spoken of,
thought no more of it, until he saw the advertise-
ment of Mr. Adams' disappearance. On mention-
ing it to another person, a female said that Mr. Colt
was indebted to Mr. Adams. (The sum we under-
stood to be $200, for printing.) The conviction
flashed upon the mind of this gentleman that Mr.
Adams was murdered on the night in question, and
he proceeded to acquaint the Mayor of the facts.—
Upon searching Colt's room, a glass was found
shattered—a hatchet, the handle of which was
newly scraped with broken glass—the end of
the handle of the axe was covered over with ink.—
The wall was also spotted with ink, as we conceive,
to conceal or obliterate the marks of blood. A por-
tion of the floor of the room has been sawn away
by the officers and carried to the Mayor's office. On
the examination of Colt, he said he made a box to
hold his trunk out of a large box which he had to
hold his stationery. This statement he probably
made to account for the use he had for tools, which
he borrowed from some person in the building. He
says that the box not answering, he threw the wood
out of the window into the street.
   In consequence of the discovery of these facts the
Mayor advertised for the carman who had carried
the box, and whom Mr. Godfrey, Superintendent of
Hacks, discovered on Saturday night. He was
taken before the Mayor, where he stated that Mr.
Colt had employed and paid him to carry a box from
his room, corner of Broadway and Chambers street,
to the ship Kalamazoo, <u>laying</u> at the foot of Maiden
lane, on the morning of the 18th inst., and that he
had delivered it there accordingly. The Mayor or-
dered officers A. M. C. Smith and <u title="Walker (elsewhere)">Waldron</u> on board
the vessel, and the hatches, which had been closed,
to be opened, and yesterday afternoon, about one
o'clock, the box was found and brought on deck.
On opening it, the body of Mr. Adams, with only
his shirt on, was found therein, packed round tightly
with salt, and an awning wrapped tightly round the
whole, and then the box nailed up. It was con-
veyed to the dead house in the Park, and the coro-
ner called to hold the inquest. Justice Taylor of
the Upper Police (who, with the Mayor and officers
above named, have been indefatigable in ferreting
out the authors of this horrid murder), discovered
the woman kept by Colt, and in her possession found
the watch of Mr. Adams.
   The following is the testimony taken on the in-
quest last night:—
<l9>			T<small>ESTIMONY.</small>
   The first witness called was—
   Dr. G<small>ILMAN</small>, who deposed that he had made a
post mortem examination of a body in the dead
house. It was the body of a man rather under the
middle size. It measures 5 feet 9½ inches in height.
It is very considerably decayed in all its parts. Should
think it has been six or seven days dead. There are
no appearances of decay, as might arise from ema-
ciation. At the back part of the head there ap-
peared something like a bald spot. The scalp was
so much decayed, that it could be pushed off the
bone with the finger. There was a little beard un-
der the chin, and very thick whiskers. On the left
<u title="= ankle">ancle</u> outside, there was a black spot, extending
four inches upward, and covering a space of perhaps
one inch and a half. The skin was drier, firmer,
and thinner than in other parts of the body. On
the first examination, the body was much bent, the
head forward to the thigh, the body towards the
belly, and the leg up to the thigh. This position
was maintained by a rope passing round the neck,
and attached to the thigh, just above the knee joint.
The injuries were only on the head; on the right
side a very extensive fracture of the skull, the pieces
of bone beaten in and entirely loose among the
pulpy mass, which was the brain. The main frac-
ture extended from the cheek bone to the top of the
parietal bone. It also passed laterally on to the region
of the temple, so as to involve a portion of the
bone. On the right side of the cranium, near the
posterior inferior angle of the parietal bone, there
was a fracture with depression, but no hole. It was
an irregular oval, about an inch and half diameter.
On the left side of the forehead, another extensive
fracture, from which the bone was driven in. The
large hole on the left side communicated with that
on the right, but was higher up, and did not involve
the orbit nor the forehead for an inch above the or-
bit. Beside the injury on the left side of the head,
there was a fracture above and behind the parietal
<u title="protuberance">protruberance</u>. This wound was nearly circular, the
bone completely detached, leaving a hole as if made
by a musket ball, on the posterior part of the cra-
nium. It was not a fracture, but a chipping off of a
portion of the bone; a fragment was found which fitted
a portion of this injury. This chopping was proba-
bly done by a sharp instrument, or a blunt one act-
ing obliquely. Should suppose the injury of the pa-
rietal bone to have been effected by a blunt instru-
ment. The lower jaw was fractured. The body
had a shirt on, which had been ripped up, and was
hanging like a gown from the arms. There was a
small plain ring on the little finger of the left hand.
The ring now produced is the same, and was taken
off the finger by the Coroner.
   The prisoner's counsel said they would waive any
cross-examination, as it was the intention to have an
examination on the part of the prisoner.</l9>
<d>[Col.4]</d>
<l9>   The testimony of Dr. Gilman was corroborated by
Dr. Kissam.
   The D<small>EPUTY</small> C<small>ORONER</small> deposed that he assisted in
removing the body found in a box, from the ship
Kalamazoo, lying at the foot of Maiden lane. When
the box was opened, it contained the body which
the physicians had examined. Inside the box were
two large cloths, or awnings, a piece of matting,
some oakum, a dress coat, and a black stock. One
of the cloths was placed right under the body, and
the other thrown over. The coat was found under
the body, and was much torn. The buttons were
common bombazine. The stock was cut open in
front, and not <u title="unbuttoned">unbottened</u> behind. There were stains
on the stock, as of blood. On the upper lid of the
box there were marks, as if directed to some one at
St. Louis, via New Orleans. There were no panta-
loons or other clothing in the box.
   T<small>HOMAS</small> R<small>USSELL</small> deposed that he was on board
the ship Kalamazoo, at the foot of Maiden lane, and
there saw a box taken out of the lower hold in the
forward hatch; it was placed on the lower deck, and
opened; saw some clothes inside, but could not
stand the stench which came from it; saw the box
put over the side, and placed on the deck; the depu-
ty coroner was there; looked at the direction; it
was directed to some man, to the care of “Grose;”
had seen that box before, on the corner of Chambers
street and Broadway, at the granite building; it was
in the Chambers street entry, and as witness believes,
on the 18th of this month; on Saturday morning,
about 9 o'clock, witness went there to his usual em-
ployment, carrying paintings for the Apollo Associ-
ation; a carman whom witness knew backed
his horse up to near mine, and I helped him to put
the box on his cart; believes the box found in the
ship to be the same; witness saw a gentleman at the
door, just before the carman came; he stood on the
first flight of stairs, while witness and the carman
were loading it; the carman drove off, and wit-
ness paid no more attention to the matter.—
Witness knows the gentleman by sight, and thinks
<u>its</u> the one sitting here (pointing to Colt) had been
employed frequently in the building and had seen
him often. Witness knew the box by its shape and
outward appearance before it was removed from its
location in the cargo.
   R<small>ICHARD</small> B<small>ARSTOW</small> deposed that he was on board
the ship Kalamazoo, at the foot of Maiden lane, and
saw a box taken from the hold. It was the same
box witness carried to the ship. It was opened
on the lower deck and contained a dead body.—
On the morning witness took the box to the ship
he was coming up Chambers street, near Church,
with his cart when a man beckoned to him, who
employed him and paid him to take the box to the
ship. That man is here, (pointing to Colt). I asked
him what vessel it was to go aboard of. He said
he did not know the name of the vessel, but would
go down with it. Witness started and the man fol-
lowed. The box was directed to the care of some
one in New Orleans, and therefore concluded it
was to go by the packet. Witness pointed to the ship
and the gentleman nodded his assent. Witness drew
up to the ship Kalamazoo and backed up. The mate
said “never mind, I'll take care of it.” The person
now here paid for the cartage. Witness gave the
information which led to the search on board the
ship. Witness took notice of the direction, because
it was put on with blue ink, which is unusual.
   L<small>OWE</small> H<small>OCKTON</small> lives in the granite building, cor-
ner of Chambers street and Broadway. Last Satur-
day week, in the morning, saw a box at the head of
the first flight of stairs from the street, and Mr.
Colt, the person now present, came and took hold
of the box, which he canted to the last flight of
stairs to bring down to the street. Colt went down
stairs backwards, guiding the box so as to prevent
its falling. Witness knew Colt by sight. He occu-
pied the next room to Mr. Wheeler. About fifteen
or twenty minutes after the time when Colt took it
down, I passed the place, and it was gone. The box
was about 3 feet long and 2½ high.
   The affidavit of Mr. Asa Wheeler was now read,
the principal contents of which are already before
the public. It was to the effect, that on Friday,
about half past three, he heard a clashing noise, as
if some persons were engaged in fencing. He ap-
plied his eye to the keyhole, and there saw what he
thought was a person on the floor, and a man, whom
he supposed to be Colt, bending over him. He also
deposed to having knocked at the door, but received
no answer, and he left a pupil to observe what was
proceeding. He some time after saw Colt, and
mentioned the noise he had heard. Colt said it
could not be in his room as he had not been there
on the afternoon in question. On a subsequent oc-
casion Colt had complained of spitting blood, and
there were some marks, as if some person had spit
blood on a part of the room, which had been rubbed
until it was nearly white. Colt told the witness that
he had upset his table and spilt his ink, and expressed
a hope that witness had not been disturbed by it.
Witness also testified to having seen two men's hats
on the table when he looked through the key hole.
There were ink marks on the ground, but it looked
as if it had been thrown about on purpose.
   J<small>OHN</small> D<small>ELNOCE</small> testified to the hearing of the noise,
and also to having heard some person come up
stairs, and go into Colt's room, and tear something
like cloth. He had directed another individual to
watch while he went out, as he had heard unusual
noises in Colt's room on the afternoon in question.
   D<small>AVID</small> D<small>OWNS</small> proved the absence of Adams.
The last witness ever heard of him was, that he
was seen on the south side of Chambers street oppo-
site the buildings where Mr. Colt was seen; that
was the last information witness got; witness has
got several pair of boots made for Mr. Adams; he
has looked at his foot; he wore 8½ or what witness
calls nines; the foot was slender, and the right toe
rather projects; he has seen the body, and examin-
ed the foot; it struck him when he first saw it, as
being Mr. Adams' foot; the hair also has the ap-
pearance of being Mr. Adams'; witness has always
seen the deceased with a dress coat, always a black
one; he measured the feet of the body; one foot mea-
sured 4½ full, but the skin was loose on the bottom
of it; the other one measured 6 scant; that would
require the sized boot which witness was in the ha-
bit of obtaining for Mr. Adams. From the circum-
stances witness has stated, he believes the body to be
that of Mr. Adams.
   J<small>AMES</small> R. C<small>HILTON</small> deposed that on Friday last,
he went to the granite building, at the request of
the Mayor; found that functionary with Justice Tay-
lor, Colt, and one or two officers. A hatchet now
produced was found and given to witness, who has
had it ever since; the object of taking the instru-
ment was to discover if there were any traces of
blood about it. On holding it up to the light, and
permitting the light to stream through the eye of the
hatchet, found a red stain as if of blood; there was
also a spot on the hammer end of the hatchet, hav-
ing a similar appearance. Witness removed some
small portion of it carefully, and examined it by a
chemical process, and as far as witness is able to
judge, it is blood. On the handle of the hatchet,
there is stain of ink all round the handle, which ap-
pears as if put on intentionally. Through the ink
marks a reddish appearance can now be seen, and
witness thinks if the blade could be removed, some
further indications could be perceived. Witness took
two or three small particles from the wall which gave
the same indications of blood as the other. Found
two spots of oil on the floor, and all round the <u title="surface">sur-
vace</u> of the room oil had been spread, or poured.
The saturating of places with oil, where blood had
been spilt, would prevent the detection of blood on
an analysis, and would efface its appearance.
   E<small>MILY</small> R. A<small>DAMS</small> deposed that she last saw her
husband, Samuel Adams alive, on Friday week at
noon—caused a search to be made, and he has not
been found, unless the body found to-day is his.—
Witness has been shown some pieces of a coat, a
stock and a finger ring now produced, which last
article she identifies as the ring of her husband,
Samuel Adams. The stock is her husband's, she
made it and knows the lining. Mr. Adams had a
watch, when he left home, which has been shewn
her this morning and the key of it. A watch and
key was here shewn the witness which she identi-
fies. The key was hers and has a mark on it where
she bit it.
   J<small>USTICE</small> T<small>AYLOR</small>, of the Upper Police, deposed
that he went to a place on Saturday last, where the
prisoner, Colt, lived with a woman who passed for
his wife—took a trunk from there, which was taken
to the Upper Police to be opened. Witness informed
Colt that a trunk was brought, and asked if there was
any objection to its being opened. He said he did
not wish it opened until his counsel was present.—
The counsel did not come, and on Saturday night
the Mayor and witness opened the trunk, and found
the watch now produced, rolled up in a piece of pa-
per.
   The jury were locked up for about ten minutes,
and found a verdict of “wilful and deliberate mur-
der” against John C. Colt, who thereupon was com-
mitted to prison, to await his trial.</l9>

   <i>Murder</i>.—We published some days since a notice
that an individual of the name of Samuel Adams, a
printer residing at the corner of Ann and Gold streets,
had left his office at about three o'clock in the after-
noon of Friday the 17th instant and had not since
been heard of. Facts now transpired, leave but little
doubt that he has been inhumanly murdered.
	...
   Mr. Wheeler thought no more of the circumstances
which had excited his attention, until the disappear-
ance of Mr. Adams, and learning accidentally that
Colt was indebted to Adams and had been seen with
him, he thought proper to give information of
the facts to one of the Lower Police officers, who paid
no attention to them. Mr. Wheeler then communi-
cated with Mr. Justice <u title="Taylor (correction in Courier-1841-09-28)">Palmer</u> and it is chiefly to
this magistrate's activity and energy, that the proba-
ble murderer has been discovered.

   HORRIBLE MURDER OF MR. ADAMS.
<small>ARREST OF THE MURDERER AND DISCOVERY OF
			THE BODY.</small>
   On Friday week Mr. Samuel Adams, a highly
respectable printer resided at 11 Elizabeth street,
of the firm of Scatcherd and Adams, of No. 59 Gold
street, suddenly and mysteriously disappeared.
He was a man of regular habits. He was adver-
tised, but nothing has been heard of him, except
that he had been at the office of the Missionary
Herald, and said he was going to see a book-seller
in Canal street, who owed him some money. He
was next seen in Broadway near Chambers street;
and it is stated that some person told him that J.
C. Colt, who owed him for printing, was about to
leave the city, when he said he would go and see
him and try to get his money. This is the last that
was seen of him, ad he did not go to Canal street,
as he intended, and it is supposed that he then
proceeded to Mr. Colt's room to demand <u title="payment">paymen</u>
for the debt.
   Mr. Colt is the author of an able work upon book
keeping, and the brother of the inventor of Colt's
celebrated fire arms. He hired a room on the sec-
ond floor of the granite building corner of Cham-
bers st. and Broadway. The room is the second
room from Broadway, and the windows face
Chambers street.
	...
   In addition to the above it is proper to state that
the gold watch of Mr. Adams was found in Colt's
trunk, at his room, in Monroe street, near Market,
and a new shirt of Colt's, with the wristbands cut
off. After the inquest Colt was committed again
to prison. To the Mayor and Justice Taylor of the
upper Police, and to officers A. M. C. Smith and
Walker great praise is due for their indefatigable
exertions in searching out and arresting the author
of this diabolical murder, and in thus placing him
in a position to receive his deserts, as well as to
satisfy the demands of the law, which has been
violated by this terrible deed of blood and death.

   C<small>ITY</small> P<small>RISON</small> S<small>TATISTICS</small>.—During the last
week there were received into the city prison, 115
white men, 44 white women, 25 black men, 16
black women—total 200. Discharged some time,
101 white men, 40 white women, 21 black men, 12
black women—total 174. Remaining in prison,
90 white men, <u>26 white men, </u>26 white women,

		<f12>AWFUL MURDER.</f12>
We have another awful murder to record, perpe-
trated in the very heart of our city. Mr. Samuel
Adams, printer, of the firm of Scatcherd <s>and Adams</s>,
in Gold street, has been missing from <s>home</s> since
Friday week. The following statement explains the
fatal cause. On the afternoon of his disappearance, Mr.
<i>Wheeler</i>, a teacher in writing, occupying a room in
the Granite Building, corner of Chambers street and
Broadway, heard a noise in a room adjoining his, oc-
cupied by <i>John C. Colt</i>, the author of a work on
Book-keeping, which sounded like two men scuffling,
and ended by what appeared to be the fall of a heavy
body. His curiosity being excited, he knocked server-
al times at the door of Colt's room, but could obtain
no answer. On looking through the keyhole he saw
Colt, apparently rubbing on the floor. Throughout
the night Colt was heard hard at work, and in the
morning was seen to bring out a large wooden box,
directed to a firm in St. Louis, via New Orleans,
which he placed in the passage. He then went out,
and returned shortly afterwards with a carman, who
took away the box.
   Having communicated these particulars to the Po-
lice office, a search was made in Colt's room, a glass
found broken on the floor, the wall spotted with ink,
and a hatchet discovered, the end of which had been
newly scraped. Colt was immediately arrested, but

   It appears that Colt was in debt about $200 to
Adams, for printing his book; and this, it is sup-
posed, was the origin of the quarrel, which ended in
murder. Mr. Adams was a married man, without
children. His watch was found in Colt's trunk, at
his boarding-house. A large crowd was collected
last night and this morning, around the building at
the corner of Chambers street, and much excitement
prevailed.
   Mr. Wheeler's first notification to the Police, on
the afternoon of the murder, was, we understand, dis-
regarded; and it was not until the Mayor himself
was apprized of the circumstances that the matter was
looked into and the murder discovered.

   H<small>ORRIBLE</small> M<small>URDER</small>.—Our readers will remem-
ber a paragraph which appeared in most of the city
papers last week, announcing the sudden and mys-
terious disappearance of Mr. Samuel Adams, prin-
ter, of No. 59 Gold street. It has since been as-
certained that he was murdered by J. C. Colt, in
the granite building on the corner of Chambers
street and Broadway.
	...
   The testimony which we give below, taken be-
fore the Coroner's inquest on Saturday evening last,
furnishes all the particulars of this dreadful affair.
   Colt is a young man, apparently about twenty-
seven years of age, of fine personal appearance,
and respectably connected. For several years past,
he has taught book-keeping in various Atlantic and
western cities.

						Friday morning. }
S<small>IR</small>,—
   The following lines were penned in a fit of the
“cacoethes scribendi,” not unfittingly, I trust, though
the subject of which they treat is a solemn one.
Should you deem them worthy of admission in your
excellent journal, will you favor me so far as to give
them an insertion. They refer to the death of Mary
Rogers, an event fraught with so many horrors, that
even the most callous and unthinking must deeply
deplore and feel it. Mingling pity for the unfortu-
nate girl with detestation for her horrible assassins,
I have rather endeavored to give expression to my
own feelings than to enter into an analysis of events,
the details of which would be too revolting to awaken
other feelings than abhorrence and loathing.
							E. <u title="S (below)">H</u>.
		<b>Lines on the Death of M. R.</b>
<m9>	Death comes to all in wayward form,
	In peaceful guise, or vengeful storm,
				All must his presence share.
	Around the dark and lurid bed
	Of those whose tortured spirits shed,
				A terror on the air.

	He marks the dread of guilty souls,
	The fear that shame no more controls,
				The darkness of despair.
	Aye! round the troubled couch of lust
	Of perjured hearts, and broken trust,
				Terrible death is there.

	And in the sad, yet quiet room,
	Where faith awaits our common doom,
				Far from this world of care;
	Where hallow'd spirits hover near,
	To wipe away the falling tear,
				And prompt the sorrower's pray'r;
	Where the soul wings its flight above,
	'Mid whispered sounds of gentle love,
				Calm, peaceful death is there.

	Hark! heard ye not that note of fear
	Burst wildly on the palsied ear,
				Far in the tangled wood?
	Merciful God! <i>what</i> sound was there—
	<i>What</i> deed of sin pollutes the air—
				<i>What</i> sickening taint of blood.

	Oh! shield me from that fearful sight—
	That crime of darkest, blackest night,
				Appalling even the brave.
	Wild shriek on shriek, and pray'r on pray'r,
	And deepest curses mingle there—
				Oh God! in pity <i>save</i>.

	<i>Who</i> heeds thy shrieks, poor hapless maid?
	There is <i>no</i> arm with strength to aid—
				No heart that has the will.
	One last wild cry that reaches heaven,
	One bitter prayer for mercy given—
				'Tis past!—and <i>all</i> is still.

	All still—the gentle song of birds—
	The whispering winds, the lowing herds,
				The scent of sweetest flowers.
	And sunset's soft and purple light,
	Sweet harbinger of coming night,
				Proclaims the evening hours.

	Alas! the scene is passing fair,
	Yet foul pollution revelled there,
				And crime, too black for name.
	Far, far from <i>all</i>, whose arm might save,
	Welcome the cold, and bloody grave,
				That hides a wretch's shame.

	Tho' tears above <i>that</i> grave be shed,
	Not tears of <i>blood</i> may wake the dead,
				Yet weep we when she fell.
	But <i>One</i> is just to all alike,
	And <i>God's</i> right arm is <s title="bound (elsewhere)">hard</s> to strike
				The coward down to Hell.

<b>The Horrible Murder of Mr. Adams—Fur-
 ther Particulars—Examination of Mr. Colt.</b>
   We yesterday gave all the particulars that had
then transpired in relation to this unfortunate affair;
to-day we give some additional facts.
   It appears that the arrest of Colt was made by the
Mayor and A. M. C. Smith in person. The Mayor
had advertised in the Wall street papers, last Wed-
nesday, for the carman who took the box away from
the granite buildings; but as he did not come, the
Mayor, on Thursday, accompanied by officers A. M.
C. Smith and Walker and Justice Taylor, proceeded
to the rooms of Mr. Wheeler in the Granite Building,
and as Colt was found to be absent, awaited his ar-
rival. He shortly came in, and while in the act of
unlocking his door, was seized on both his arms by
the iron grasp of Smith. It was expected he would
make resistance, as he was reputed to carry a re-
volving pistol in his pocket; but he submitted to his
arrest without a murmur. Mr. Smith states that he
saw a change in the countenance of Colt the moment
he seized him. From its natural paleness, his face
turned to a livid and deathlike hue, and it was some
moments before he could recover himself to speak
audibly. Colt was then taken to the Mayor's office,
and the following were his replies to the interroga-
tories put to him:—
   The Mayor asked Colt—Where do you reside?
   C<small>OLT</small>—I do not live any where—I sleep in my
room in the Granite Building, upon the floor, and
get my meals at the eating houses.
   M<small>AYOR</small>—Were you in your room on Friday
evening last?
   C<small>OLT</small>—I do not recollect—it is very possible,
however. I know I slept there.
   M<small>AYOR</small>—Were you engaged on that evening in
packing and nailing up a box—and did you send such
box away in the morning?
   C<small>OLT</small>—I know of no box, except one which I had
made to put my trunk in, and as that was in the
way, I threw it out doors into the street.
   M<small>AYOR</small>—Then you are certain you was not en-
gaged on that evening in packing or nailing a box;
and you are equally certain that you sent no box
away on Saturday morning?
   C<small>OLT</small>—Most assuredly I saw no box—nor did I
sent any box away.
   It being now evident that Colt told an untruth, the
Mayor ordered his room to be searched. Upon the
floor a shattered glass was found; also a hatchet, the
handle of which was newly scraped with broken
glass—the end of the handle being covered over
with ink. The wall was also spotted with ink, as if
to conceal or obliterate the marks of blood. A por-
tion of the floor of the room was then sawn away by
the officers and carried to the Mayor's office.
   Colt was examined yesterday after being visited
by his counsel, Robert Emmet, John A. Morrill, and
Dudley <u title="Selden (elsewhere)">Seldon</u>, Esqs. Colt looked very pale, and his
eye had a wildish look as he came into the room, but
he neither quailed nor faltered. He was dressed in
black very genteelly. He held his hands as he came
into the room in the same position as when he was
hand cuffed, although the irons were off them. He
also had a haggard look. He is well made, but very
slim, although full of nerve and sinew. He is about
5 feet 9 inches high. His hair is dark brown and
curly, and he has largish whiskers. He would be
good looking but for his eye, which is one of those
brown colored class of eyes that cannot easily be
read, and that are generally found in the faces of all
scoundrels, schemers and plotters.
   He was placed before the bar of the Upper Police
and Justice Taylor conducted the examination.
   J<small>USTICE</small>—Mr. Colt, you are now about to be ex-
amined on the charge of having wilfully murdered
Mr. Samuel Adams, on the night of Friday the 17th
inst. You are not bound to answer any question
unless you think proper.
   Colt looked down and bowed.
   J<small>USTICE</small>—What is your name?
   C<small>OLT</small>—(Firmly) John C. Colt.
   J<small>USTICE</small>—Where were you born?
   C<small>OLT</small>—(Faintly) Hartford, Connecticut.
   J<small>USTICE</small>—What is your age?
   C<small>OLT</small>—(Faintly)—Thirty.
   J<small>USTICE</small>—What age?
   E<small>MMET</small>—He is thirty years of age.
   J<small>USTICE</small>—Where do you reside?
   C<small>OLT</small>—In New York.
   J<small>USTICE</small>—What is your business?
   C<small>OLT</small>—Book-keeping.
   J<small>USTICE</small>—You follow book-keeping?
   C<small>OLT</small>—I have another business; but I have latterly
pursued that of book-keeping.
   J<small>USTICE</small>—Ah! yes. Are you married?
   The Counsel here handed Colt a written piece of
paper.
   M<small>ORRILL</small>—Give that as your answer.
   Colt handed the paper on which it was written <u>to
to</u> Justice Taylor.
   James R. Whiting, Esq. wished a full answer.
   <u>E<small>MMETT</small></u>—The answer is that “under the advice
of my counsel I decline answering any further ques-
tions. But I am innocent of the charge.”
   Colt said that was his answer, and ultimately it
was so recorded.
   J<small>USTICE</small> T<small>AYLOR</small>—What have you to say in rela-
tion to the charge against you?
   C<small>OLT</small> (to his counsel) must I answer now?
   C<small>OUNSEL</small>—You may if you like, but we advise you
not to do so.
   C<small>OLT</small>—I decline answering by advice of my coun-
sel; but I am innocent of the charge.
   This closed the examination; and Colt was then
taken back to his cell.
   The above is all that transpired yesterday in rela-
tion to this shocking affair. John C. Colt is a per-
son of some eminence as a book-keeper, and is the
author of a new system of book-keeping, several
editions of which work have already appeared. For
some time past he has been occupied in getting up
an entire new and different edition of his work,
which was stereotyped by J. S. Redfield, 13 Cham-
bers street, and printed by Mr. Adams, the unfor-
tunate deceased. When he applied to Mr. Adams
to print his work, he made an arrangement to the
effect that Mr. A. should receive his pay out of the
first sales. The book was accordingly printed and
sent to the binder, and an arrangement was effected
to receive a considerable advance from a house in
Philadelphia upon a consignment of the first copies.
Mr. Adams was of course to make this consignment
and receive the proffered advance. On Friday, 17th
inst. Mr. Charles Wells, the bookbinder, apprised
Mr. Adams that Colt had ordered him to box up all
the books that were completed, as it was his inten-
tion to take them to Philadelphia himself. Adams
was astonished at this movement on the part of
Colt, and said that such a proceeding would be
fraudulent towards him, and that he would immedi-
ately go and see Colt about it. Shortly after three
o'clock, same day, Mr. Adams called at the Mis-
sionary Society's rooms in City Hall place, near
Chambers street, and this was the last place that he
was seen by any of his friends alive. From thence
<d>[Col.4]</d>
he undoubtedly proceeded direct to Colt's room, in
the 2d story of the large granite building corner of
Broadway and Chambers street.
   Mr. Adams was born in Providence, and served
his time with old John Miller. He has a sister
married to Mr. Sackett, of the firm Sackett &
Willett, jewellers. She was 35 years old. He was
33. He has also a young sister. His parents are
both dead, but most of his relatives still live in
Providence. He had a wife, but no children. Both
were members of Dr. Spring's Church, and likewise
members of the choir. Mr. Adams came to this
city some seven or eight years since, and worked
for a while as a journeyman printer. Soon afterward
he entered into partnership with a Scotchman
named <u>Scatchard</u>, and under the name of <u>Scatchard</u>
and Adams, they carried on business together as job
and book printers. His partner soon died and he
continued the business in his own name. He lost
nearly all his property, partly by fire and partly by
the failure of those who owed him, and was in debt
some $5000 at the time of his death. He was an
industrious and religious man, respected by all who
knew him. He married the daughter of Mr. Jane,
cabinet maker.
   The relatives of Mr. Colt are very respectable
indeed; his brother is the inventor of the patent re-
volving pistols and rifles, and keeps an extensive es-
tablishment of this kind at 155 Broadway. He has
another brother who is Cashier of the Hartford
Bank. It is also said that he is a distant relative of
Dudley Selden, Esq., the eminent counsellor. On
being visited by the keeper of the prison, yesterday
morning, he presented the same stoical coldness of
countenance which has characterized him through-
out since his arrest; he expresses no desire for any
thing but that he may be shaved. Characteristic of
his coolness and determination is an instance: on
Thursday morning last he called at Mr. Adams'
printing office, and inquired of Mr. <u title="Monahan (elsewhere)">Monohan</u>, the
foreman, if Mr. A. was in, and on being informed that
he was not, he hastily remarked, “Oh! Ah! I re-
collect I have seen a notice that he was missing.
Mr. Adams has done work for me for three years,
and he is a fine man, and always treated me well,
and I hope nothing serious has befallen him.”
   The female in whose possession the watch and
other articles were found, is not the wife of Colt, as
was supposed even by her own relatives, who are
very respectable. She is by him <u title="enceinte"><i>enciente</i></u>, and the
period of her <u title="accouchement">accouchment</u> is near.
   Judge Taylor is still pursuing his inquiries in
search of other testimony. He has succeeded in
finding, at the residence of Colt's mistress, a carpet
bag, which, among other things, contained a quanti-
ty of paper covered with blood, as if wiped from the
hands; also at the same place was found a shirt,
nearly a new one, and of a size fitting the prisoner;
the wristband of which is stained with blood, and
the collar torn open as if to make haste <u title="in">is</u> changing
the garment.
   Capt. Hyde, keeper of the city prison, visited the
prisoner yesterday morning, and on Mr. H. being
introduced to him, coolly remarked, “Well, I sup-
pose I shall have to come down and stay with you;
you'll treat me well, won't you?” He also com-
plained to Justice Taylor that his food was brought
to him on plates that were not quite clean, and
hoped this might be rectified.
   Those who believe in dreams we shall gratify, in
conclusion, by stating that some days before Adams
was murdered, his wife dreamed that she saw him
dead—murdered and stript naked and put into a box,
and his clothes thrown into a privy. She awoke
and burst into tears; but finding her husband asleep
by the side of her, she said nothing about it. The
next night she dreamed the same thing, and next day
concluded to tell her mother of it; but finally
laughed it off as an idle dream. There is no doubt
of the truth of these facts, and to say the least of it,
it was very remarkable.

		THE LATE MURDER.
   Yesterday afternoon John C. Colt was brought
before Justice Taylor of the Upper Police, and
there examined according to law on the charge of
having, on the 17th instant, wilfully and delibe-
rately murdered Samuel Adams. He was in-
formed of the charge made against him, and told
that he was at liberty to answer any questions that
might be put to him. On being interrogated he
stated that he was born at Hartford, Ct.—that he
is now 30 years of age, a resident of this City, and
a teacher of Book-keeping.
   <i>Question by the Court</i>. Are you married?
   <i>Answer</i>. I decline answering, under the advice
of my counsel, that or any other question.
   <i>Question</i>. Have you any thing to say in re-
lation to the charge now made against you?
   <i>Answer</i>. I am innocent of the charge.
   The prisoner, under advice of his counsel, D<small>UD-
LEY</small> S<small>ELDEN</small>, R<small>OBERT</small> E<small>MMET</small> and J<small>OHN</small> A <u>M<small>OR-
RELL</small></u>, Esqs., refused to sign his name to the ex-
amination, and was committed to prison in full to
answer the charge. The appearance of the mur-
derer, (for such he must now be deemed beyond a
doubt,) has greatly changed since he was first ar-
rested. His countenance, which at first was pale,
has now become livid and death-like in its hue and
his general aspect is haggard and repulsive in the
extreme. In consequence of the difficulty attend-
ing the summoning of witnesses, his indictment
was not made out yesterday; witnesses were how-
ever <u title="subpoenaed">subpoened</u> for to-day and he will probably be
indicted immediately. It is not likely, however,
that his trial will come on at the present session of
the Court as his counsel will undoubtedly obtain a
delay until the present intense excitement shall
have in some degree abated. There was a rumor
current in the lower part of the city yesterday af-
ternoon that he had committed suicide by hanging;
it is scarcely necessary to say that the precaution
of his jailor rendered any such report utterly with-
out foundation. In the morning he asked for a
razor with which to shave himself; but was told
by the keeper of the prison that he could not
be trusted with a razor and that none of the pri-
soners were ever allowed to use them.
   Colt's family is said to be highly respectable.
His native place, as he stated on his examination,
is Hartford, Ct. where his parents still reside. We
understand that his father has been for many years
Comptroller of the State of Connecticut, one of the
highest offices in the Commonwealth, and also ex-
tensively engaged in the printing of silks and other
branches of manufacture. We have been told that
the family are highly esteemed but known to be of
violent passions, over which few of them have any
great control. One of the sisters of the prisoner a
few years since committed suicide. We believe it
is not true, as has been stated, that he has a bro-
ther who is Cashier of the Hartford Bank; that
gentleman, whose name is Colt, being at best but
a distant relative. While quite young, John C.
Colt, the prisoner, was employed as clerk in a
crockery store in his native city, of which a cousin
of his was one of the partners.
   He remained there some time, until he was de-
tected in pilfering from his employers, at first small
sums, and afterward five or ten dollars at a time,
when he was dismissed as not trust-worthy. From
this beginning, which many are prone to think ex-
ceeding small, to what a depth of horrid guilt and
blasting infamy has he plunged! Thus may we
learn that Crime has a vital, growing power,
which, though contemptible to the outward eye in
its first shooting forth, soon spreads abroad its
branches, thrusts downward deep into the heart
its mighty roots, and overshadows the whole inner
being with its death-distilling shade. What trea-
sures would this wretched man now gladly give
could he again be placed upon the scenes of his
first lapses from honesty and truth—the bitter fruits
of whose 'foul flowering' he is now to reap!
   In a freak of passion at an early age he fled
from his father's house to one of the Southern
States, where he remained for some four years,
procuring a support by various means, sometimes
by honorable labor, and at others by dishonest
tricks. Some years since a warrant was issued
for his arrest, but never served, for swindling
operations in Philadelphia; and in 1839 he was
brought before the Police of this City for having
burglariously entered the office of Judge Inglis, at
that time in Wall-street, and stolen sundry papers
therefrom. He then gave his name as Brown,
and his case was never brought to trial. He is
said to have lived for some time past with a
woman who formerly moved in high society in
Connecticut, whose husband has been gone for
some time to the West Indies. In this City,
among Colt's acquaintances, she has passed as his
wife.
   It is said that the body of the murdered Adams
was robbed of a considerable sum of money, which
it is thought Colt knew he had in his possession.
<d>[Col.2]</d>
From this and other circumstances there is said
to be ground for the belief that this horrible mur-
der was planned beforehand, and executed with
cool deliberation, instead of having been the re-
sult of momentary passion, as is much the more
charitable supposition.
   The imagination cannot avoid picturing to itself
this terrible murder, nor can it dwell for a moment
upon the scene without deep thrills of horror; that
one human being, with the warm, bright sunlight
streaming alike upon him and his victim, at the
corner of two of the most thronged streets in our
Metropolis, with the bustle of business and the
voices of men sounding in his ears, should thus
murder his fellow, with such aggravated atrocity,
and then proceed with such cool, heartless in-
difference to remove the corse and to stifle the
terrible voice which cried aloud, and all around
him, for swift vengeance upon his most unholy act,
seems almost impossible; and the mind half
dreams—and rejoices at the delusion—that some
fiend from the realm of gilt and woe has wrought
this awful ruin.

   <i>The Murder of Adams</i>.—In our account of this
horrid affair yesterday, we unintentionally did great
injustice to Justice Taylor, of the Upper Police. It
was through that gentleman's vigilance and exer-
tions, the train of evidence adduced before the Coro-
ner was brought forward, and not through Justice
Palmer, as we erroneously stated. Public excite-
ment is still unallayed, and various rumors were yes-
terday afloat in regard to the prisoner Colt, all, how-
ever, without foundation. He was yesterday after-
noon, about 3 o'clock, examined before Justice Tay-
lor, of the upper Police Office, on the charge of having
on the 17th instant, wilfully and deliberately mur-
dered Samuel Adams; and being informed of the
charge made against him, and that he was at liberty
to refuse to answer any questions that might be put
to him, he replied, that he was born at Hartford,
Connecticut; is 30 years of age; resides in New
York, and is a teacher of book-keeping.
   <i>Question</i>. Are you married?
   <i>Answer</i>. I decline answering, under the advice of
my counsel, that or any other question.
   <i>Question</i>. Have you any thing to say in relation to
the charge now made against you?
   <i>Answer</i>. I am innocent of the charge.
   The prisoner was attended by his counsel, Messrs.
Selden, R. <u title="Emmet Robert (elsewhere)">Emmett</u>, and J. A. Morrill—and refusing
to sign his name to the examination, was committed
to prison in full, to answer.

   I<small>NJUNCTION UPON THE</small> C<small>OMMERCIAL</small> B<small>ANK</small>.—
An injunction was yesterday served upon the
Commercial Bank of this city, and its doors clos-
ed. It was obtained on the request of the Bank
Commissioners, who suppose the bad manage-
ment has made serious inroads upon the capital.—
	...
   We understand that the Bank is largely indebt-
ed to the Canal Fund. The bills of the bank will
be received this day, and hereafter, by all of
our city banks, under an arrangement made with
the Bank Commissioners, that they shall draw on
the Commissioners of the Safety Fund, at once,
to reimburse themselves.</f>
   Mr. Godfrey, who found out the carman that
carried the box, and who has been instrumental in
bringing this deed of blood to light, is the Super-
intendent of carts, and not of hacks, as has been
stated.
			—————
   T<small>HE</small> M<small>URDER OF</small> A<small>DAMS</small>.—There are but few
facts of any importance to add to the account of
this tragic affair which we gave yesterday. The
remains of the murdered man have been consign-
ed to the tomb. The Coroner's jury found a ver-
dict of wilful murder against Colt. The proof is
perfectly conclusive.
   Mr. Adams was originally from Providence.
His parents are both dead, but most of his rela-
tives still live in that city. He had a wife but no
children. Both were member of Dr. Spring's
Church, and likewise member of the choir.
   Colt's connexions are highly respectable. His
brother is the inventor of the patent revolving pis-
tols and rifles, and keeps an extensive establish-
ment of this kind at 155 Broadway. He has ano-
ther brother who is Cashier of the Hartford Bank.
What could have been his motive for the perpe-
tration of this horrid deed no one can tell but him-
self. Of course a thousand idle rumors are afloat,
but they are not to be relied upon, and are only
picked up to excite a little additional wonder.

   The prisoner, who was attended by his coun-
sel, R. <u>Emmett</u>, and J. A. Morrill, refused to

haggard, and was then committed in full to an-
swer the charge.

			<m9>[Reported for the Sun.]</m9>
   The autumn term commenced yesterday morn-

   The trial of James Gordon Bennett for libel on
Judges Noah and Lynch was called up, but Mr.
Morrill asked to have it postponed for the term,
owing to the absence of Mr. Bennett from the city.
The court will give its decision on the motion this

ARREST OF ONE OF THE MURDERERS OF
		MARY C. ROGERS.
			———
   On Monday, James Finnegan, a rowdy, of con-
firmed rascality, was arrested in this city by offi-
cer Tompkins, of the New-York police, under
information amounting nearly to certainty, that
he is one of the wretches who committed the out-
rage and murder on Mary C. Rogers.
   It seems that the New-York police have alrea-
dy two or three of the gang in custody; that one
of them confessed to the crime, and implicated
Finnegan; and that the keeper of a house, to
which they were in the habit of resorting, inform-
ed the police of F.'s whereabouts, he having quit
the city immediately after the murder. It is sta-
ted, that the gang consisted of six or seven per-
sons, whose atrocities in various forms are fami-
liar in the police annals; that two of them were
known to Mary Rogers, and meeting her in the
street, on the morning of her murder, invited her
to a sail to Hoboken, saying that they had hired a
boat with oarsmen; that she accompanied them;
was enticed, unsuspecting, to a retired part of the
shore, and there, after the accomplishment of
their hellish purposes, brutally murdered.
   Finnegan when arrested wore a ring which is
said to have been identified as one belonging to
Mary Rogers. The Bee says that he is one of <u title="the">th</u>
gang who about a year since committed a gross
outrage upon a young girl in this city.

   T<small>HE</small> L<small>ATE</small> M<small>URDER</small>.—The horrible and appa-
rently cold-blooded murder, committed on the cor-
ner of Chambers street and Broadway, has pro-
duced a great excitement throughout the city.—
That a man should be killed, in broad day, in a
public building, every room of which was occu-
pied, and situated in the most frequented thorough-
fare of the city, and by a person who cannot be
conceived to have had any motive for the act, are
facts that have caused a great deal of alarm and
astonishment. Mr. Adams, the person murdered,
was a very respectable tradesman, of quiet and ami-
able demeanour and industrious habits. He was a
native of <u title="Providence (elsewhere)">Boston</u>, and has left a wife and <u title="no (elsewhere)">several</u>
children. It has been conjectured by some, that
Adams, in dunning Colt for money, might have
used insolent language, and in that way provoked
him into a fight, but we are told that he was a sin-
gularly mild and forbearing man in his manners.
   Colt is a young man, about thirty years of age, of
fine personal appearance and address, and possessed
of no little ingenuity and talent. He is a native of
Hartford, where his parents now reside, and has
brothers of respectable standing living at Paterson.
It is not true, however, that Colt has always borne
an unimpeachable character; for, we are told, that
not long since he was suspected by the police to
have been concerned in a burglary, and once was
requested, we believe, to remove from the Astor
House because a number of false keys were found in
his possession. But nothing positive, in the way
of crime, has ever been proved against him. The
<i>Express</i> adds these particulars of his conduct:—
Yet Colt was an extremely irritable, and could
scarcely be asked for a debt without being thrown
into a violent passion.

<l9>   The prisoner still maintains the same indiffer-
ence to his situation, that he has evinced ever
since his arrest. Indeed, the deep and well-laid
plans to destroy the evidence of his guilt, and his
coolness and self-possession in carrying them out,
exhibits a firmness of nerve most extraordinary.—
	...
   The female in whose possession the watch was
found, is not the wife of Colt, as even her own rela-
tives, who are very respectable, supposed. She
had been kept by him for some time, and is now
within a few months of her confinement. She was
discharged, it appears, after her examination—but
we presume is now in custody, as she will become
a material witness in the case.
	...
   Colt has been in close confinements in one of the
cells beneath the upper police office, and is kept in
irons, and every means taken to prevent his com-
mitting self-destruction—a result he evidently con-
templates. His great wish is to be shaved, and he
has made frequent and urgent requests to be al-
lowed a razor for that purpose, which of course has
been refused him.</l9>

   Yesterday at three o'clock, Colt was brought be-
fore the magistrates for examination. He was hag-
gard and pale, and evidently suffering under deep
mental excitement. When questioned as to his
name, residence, and profession, he answered wil-
lingly; but when asked whether he was married, he
declined, under the advice of counsel, making any
reply. To the question, whether he had anything
to say in regard to the charge brought against him,
he merely answered, “I am innocent.” The case
will probably be tried at the next term of Oyer and
Terminer Court. His counsel are Messrs. <u>Emmett</u>
and Morrill and Dudley Selden, to whom he is re-
lated.

   T<small>HE</small> T<small>RIAL OF</small> C<small>OLT</small>.—The Grand Jury of the
Court of Oyer and Terminer having found a true
bill against J<small>OHN</small> C. C<small>OLT</small> for the murder of Sam-
uel Adams, the accused was yesterday taken from
the city Prison and brought, heavily ironed, into
the chamber of the Assistant Aldermen. His
irons were here taken off, and he was conducted
into Court, before Judge Kent and Aldermen
Woodhull and Leonard, to plead to the indictment.
His Counsel however moved the Court for a post-
ponement of the plea until Wednesday (this) morn-
ing, when he will be called upon to plead guilty or
not guilty to the indictment. At the request of
Counsel, a copy of the indictment was ordered to
be furnished them. Colt was then remanded, his
irons again put on him, and he conducted to prison.
His appearance is that of a man struggling with
intense energy to stifle terrible feelings that seem
to vex his soul; and this continued contest with
his own heart has already given to his countenance
a haggard and most repulsive aspect. He is con-
tinually attempting to converse with his jailer about
the murder, and has been repeatedly checked by
him when apparently on the point of making dis-
closures which would be greatly against him on
his trial.

officers Hilliker and Tompkins arrested in the
City of Albany, a young man belonging to this
City, charged with the commission of a felony here
some two months since. He was not arrested for
the murder of Mary C. Rogers, as some of the

was committed for examination at the Upper Po-

   Our correspondent at Albany has forwarded to

below. After recapitulating the circumstance of
the robbery of the Herkimer County Bank, and
the pursuit of the robbers to Albany, as stated by
us yesterday, our correspondent proceeds as fol-

	...
   Some of our police officers are in this city, hav-
ing been despatched hither by his honor the May-
or in pursuit of a young man who is believed to
have been engaged in the murder of Miss Rogers.
They arrested him yesterday, in the bar room of
the American Hotel, which he entered while they
were seated there, though he was entirely unsus-
picious of danger. His name I am not at liberty
to state. Two others, believed to have been his
accomplices in that horrible affair, are now, as I
understand, in prison in New York. If they are
the guilty wretches they are believed to be, Hea-
ven grant the fact may be made to appear beyond
the reach of doubt.

   D<small>EVELOPMENTS AT THE</small> A<small>LBANY</small> P<small>OLICE</small> O<small>F-
FICE</small>.—We learn from the Albany Atlas of yes-
terday, that several girls of bad character were
arrested there on Monday, and that on their exa-
mination before the magistrate, one of them stated
that one James Finnegan was with her on Sun-
day, and had in his possession a ring with the
name of Mary C. Rogers upon it. He is one of
the individuals arrested in Albany, as stated in
the letter of our correspondent, and is said to be a
notorious bad fellow. The Atlas says that he and
his accomplice were arrested on the charge of be-
ing engaged in the outrage upon the other female
at Hoboken on the same day that Miss Rogers
was murdered.

	...
   I<small>N THE</small> W<small>RONG</small> B<small>OX</small>.—In making up our yester-
day's paper, a paragraph belonging to the notice
of the murder of Adams was accidentally annex-
ed to the account of the burst up of the Commer-
cial bank. We suppose the foreman considered
the transactions so nearly on a par that it was lit-
tle matter how they were commingled.
			—————
   T<small>HE</small> D<small>IFFERENCE</small>.—The young villains who
robbed the Herkimer County Bank will doubtless
be consigned to the state prison; while those who
have robbed and ruined the Commercial Bank
will walk abroad in the community as gentlemen
of respectability. Why this difference? The
former had no charter under which to commit
their crime—the latter had. <i>Ergo</i>, all rogues
should take the precaution to get incorporated.

   ☞ The Journal of Commerce says that Colt,
the murderer, is not a brother of the Cashier at
Hartford.

   Colt is a young man of rather slender form,
somewhat above a middling height. His counte-
nance is of the Grecian cast, mouth small, and
chin somewhat prominent. He wears his hair,
which inclines to curl, thick, and sports a large,
though not bushy pair of handsome whiskers. He
seemed calm, and his appearance created favora-
ble interest in the minds of the large audience as-
sembled. He will probably be arraigned to-day.

   ☞ We are requested to state that Mr. Colt has
sold the right to his patent rifle and pistol to the
Patent Arms Company, and that he has now no
connection whatever with their store at No. 155
Broadway.

		<b>The Murder of Mr. Adams.</b>
   Late on Monday evening, and after his examina-
tion by the police magistrates, John C. Colt was
fully committed by Justice Taylor for trial at the
Court of Oyer and Terminer. On the same day,
our indefatigable and talented District Attorney,
James R. Whiting, Esq., (than whom this city
never had a better officer) presented all the papers
in the case to the Grand Jury, then in session; but
from the extreme difficulty of getting all the wit-
nesses to attend the Grand Jury, no indictment was
found against Colt on Monday. Yesterday, how-
ever, very early after they met, the Grand Jury
found true bill for wilful murder against Colt, and
the District Attorney had <u title="him">eim</u> brought into the Court
of Oyer and Terminer, (then in session,) between
one and two o'clock yesterday afternoon, for the
purpose of having him arraigned.
   The whole of this matter was done so quietly
that very few persons were present, besides those
necessarily connected with the court, and several of
the most eminent lawyers of the city. On the bench
was the young Judge, William Kent, Esq., Alder-
man Woodhull and Alderman Leonard. Around
and in the immediate vicinity of the bench were
David Graham, Esq., Henry <u title="M. (elsewhere)">J.</u> Western, Esq., John
McKeon, Esq., Morris Franklin, Esq., Robert Em-
met, Esq., John A. Morrill, Esq. and over twenty
others, whose names we cannot now recollect, but
among the most eminent lawyers of the city. So
great was the curiosity to see the supposed murderer
of Mr. Adams, and so intense is the excitement that
this most extraordinary and unparalleled case has
occasioned, even amongst the legal fraternity.
   The rapid manner in which this case has been
disposed of, may be imagined from the following
facts:—The body of Mr. Adams was discovered late
on Saturday night, on board of the <u title="Kalamazoo">Kallamazoo</u>, by
Wm. F. Godfrey, the superintendent of carts, after
a tedious and painful course of inquiry. On Sun-
day, the body in the box was taken out of the ship,
and put into the dead house in the Park; the same
day the coroner held an inquest on the body, and
Colt was present at the inquest. The very next day,
Monday, the body was buried and Colt was brought
out for examination by Justice Taylor, and fully
committed for trial. And <u>on</u> yesterday, the Grand
Jury brought in a true bill of indictment for murder
against him, and he was brought into Court, and
arraigned with a view to put him on his trial imme-
diately.
   As soon as he was brought into Court, those who
knew him pressed forward, and evinced the greatest
anxiety to see him. Colt was not so pale as he was
on Monday at the Police office; his eye was less
restless, and he was apparently firm, calm, and col-
lected. He, however, watched the proceedings of
his counsel, and the remarks made by the Court with
the most intense anxiety.
	...
   C<small>OURT</small>—The Court allow you till to-morrow, sir,
to put in a plea.
   M<small>ORRILL</small>—Very well, sir; we now want a copy
of the indictment.
   W<small>HITING</small>—It shall be furnished to you, sir, this af-
ternoon.
   The prisoner was then taken back to his cell in
the Halls of Justice. His behavior, throughout, was
calm and firm.
   Colt, we understand, is the grandson of the late
John Caldwell, of Hartford, for years a distinguished
merchant of Hartford. He is cousin (not brother)
of the Cashier of Exchange Bank. He is the son
of Christopher Colt, of Hartford, for many years a
merchant of that place, and subsequently president
of the Silk Manufacturing Co. of Hartford. Colt's
mother died many years ago—and one of his sisters
committed suicide in 1827. He has no sister living
at this time. He has many connections among the
most respectable inhabitants of that city. It is not
true that his father was Comptroller of the State of
Connecticut: it was his uncle, Elisha Colt, who was
Comptroller.
   The manner in which the box was discovered by
Godfrey was thus: Godfrey took out a list of all
the carts that had a station on the North River,
above Chambers street. He overhauled 384 carts
before he found the furniture cart that was by the
side of the other cart when the box was put on it.
From this he traced out the carman, Barstow, and
thus found out the ship and the box.

with being concerned in the abduction and violation
of the young girl at Williamsburgh, and <i>not</i> Mary

arrested, he had on his finger a ring, which has been
identified as the one belonging to the girl.

ed to have been concerned in the outrage commit-
ted upon Mary C. Rogers. The police have been
in search of them for two weeks; but they managed
to elude it till Monday last, when they were dis-
covered in one of the hotels in Albany. It is said
that one of these men was seen with a ring in his
possession, having the name of Mary C. Rogers on

   A<small>RREST OF ONE OF THE</small> M<small>URDERERS OF</small> M<small>ARY</small>
R<small>OGERS</small>.—We learn from a gentleman who arrived
in town from Albany this morning, that a very im-
portant arrest has been effected in that city by two
New York officers. An individual for whom they
had been in search two weeks—and against whom
strong suspicions and circumstances exist that he
was engaged in the horrible Hoboken (or Weehaw-
ken) Tragedy, was discovered by them on Sunday
evening and taken into custody early the next morn-
ing. He will of course be brought on to this city
as privately as possible, and examined before the
Mayor.—<i>Evening Tattler</i>.

   Similar statements appear in other papers. They
err, however, in saying that Finnegan, the person al-
luded to, is charged with any participation in the
murder of Miss Rogers. Messrs. Tompkins and
<s title="Hilleker ? Hilliker (elsewhere)">Hillsher</s>, who had him in charge, informed us that he
was concerned in the outrage committed near Wil-
liamsburgh, L. I., where a young lady was taken
from a boat by several wretches by whom she was
inhumanly treated. One of the villains was in cus-
tody before the arrest of Finnegan, on whose finger
the ring stolen from the girl was found.

   S<small>ELF</small>-M<small>ARRYING</small>.—A curious instance of pro-
fligate hypocrisy on one side and simplicity on the
other, was exhibited on Monday, before the Police
Court of Boston. A German named Hohnholz,
officiating as pastor of a German congregation,
was brought up on a charge of immorality. The
witness against him was a German girl named Re-
gina <u title="Heilnich, Heilnisch, Heilmich (elsewhere)">Hellmich</u>, who deposed in substance that
Hohnholz met her in the street—offered to find a
place at which she could go into service—took her
to his boarding house—made love to her—per-
suaded her that he was authorized to marry him-
self to her—took her into his room and made a
prayer, which he represented as equivalent to the
marriage ceremony, and then made her accompany
him to Salem, where they passed the night as man
and wife.
   Returning the next day, he <u title="locked">looked</u> her up in his
room and kept her from Friday to Sunday morn-
ing, when he took her to his Church and preached
as usual. The poor girl was firmly convinced that
she was lawfully married to her betrayer. We
presume that the upshot of the matter will be a
more efficient marriage <i title="according to the art/profession/trade"><u title="secundum">secundem</u> artem</i>.

   T<small>HE</small> T<small>RIAL OF</small> C<small>OLT</small>.—At the opening of the
Court of Oyer and Terminer yesterday morning,
John C. Colt was placed at the bar, guarded by
two officers, and his indictment read by the Clerk.
It contains four counts, the first and second charging
him with wilfully and maliciously killing Samuel
Adams by inflicting a mortal wound on the right
side of his head with a hatchet, the third with in-
flicting the said wound with some deadly instru-
ment to the jurors unknown, and the fourth charging
him with killing the said Adams by inflicting sev-
eral wounds upon his head with some instrument
unknown. He plead not guilty to the charge, and
on motion of Mr. Whiting, the District Attorney,
his trial was set down for Monday the 11th day of
October next. The District Attorney gave notice
that he should positively press the trial on that
day, at the same time saying that if the prisoner's
Counsel should then be unprepared to proceed with
it, and would give him three days' notice, he would
afford them all reasonable indulgence. It is said
that the prisoner's Counsel intend to make it out
a case of manslaughter in the first degree, by pro-
ving, mainly by the testimony of Mr. Wheeler, who
overheard the scuffle between Adams and his mur-
derer, excessive provocation on the part of the for-
mer, and that Colt inflicted the fatal blow in a mo-
ment of heated passion. There is little probabil-
ity, however, that they will be successful in this.
We stated on Friday that Colt was once indicted
for burglariously entering the office of Judge Inglis,
and that his case was never brought to trial. We
learn that the bill was found against him by the
Grand Jury on the 15th of May, 1839. He then
gave his name as simply John Colt, and was bailed
out, in the sum of $500, by one Samuel Colt, who
gave the Astor House as his place of residence.
In the ensuing September the case was called on
for trial, but the defendant did not appear, nor
could his surety be found; and thus the matter
stands to this day.

   T<small>HE</small> <u title="KAMCHATKA">K<small>AMSCHATKA</small></u>.—This magnificent Russian
steam-frigate went to sea yesterday morning in
charge of her gentlemanly commander, Capt. Von
<u title="Schantz">Shauntz</u>. A party of about one hundred ladies
and gentlemen went on board and accompanied
her to the Hook, which she left amid the hearty
cheers of the company. With only two inches of
steam she made he excursion from the City to the
Hook, a distance of sixteen miles, in two hours, to
the entire satisfaction of all on board. Through
the polite attention of the builders, Messrs.
Schuyler, the steamboat <a href="http://archive.org/details/discoveryearlyhi01nels" title="The Indians applied the name Arisseoh to the greater portion of what is now the lower part of Jersey City (p. 18)">Arisseoh</a> went down and
brought the party back. On their return they
were furnished by the Messrs. Schuyler with a
splendid entertainment on board, to which they
did most ample justice. P<small>HILIP</small> H<small>ONE</small>, Esq. pre-
sided, and Messrs. Charles King, J. Prescott Hall
Esq., J. C. Stevens, J. Watson Webb, Capt. Funk
of the Havre Line, Gen. Dorsey of N. J., M. de
Bodisco the Russian Minister, Mr. Rhoades, the
Naval Constructor, and many other gentlemen, sat
down at the board, and by toasts, speeches and
social wit, made the occasion one of high festivity.
The only passengers on board the <u>Kamschatka</u>, on
her outward passage, are Madame Von <u title="Schantz">Shauntz</u>,
George L. Schuyler, one of the contractors, and
James A. Hamilton, Esq. The frigate carries in
her machinery and construction 200,000 pounds of
copper, 50,000 of wrought and 300,000 of cast
iron, and employed two hundred and fifty men for
eight months in building. Her machinery, made
by Messrs. Dunham & Co. of this City, is beyond
all question, the most splendid workmanship ever
produced in this country: her shafts, arms &c. are
all of wrought iron, unusually large, and the whole
worked without the slightest jar and with perfect
ease and efficiency. As a specimen of American
mechanism, she reflects the highest honor upon
our country.

   T<small>HE</small> A<small>LBANY</small> A<small>RREST</small>.—We mentioned yester-
day the arrest at Albany, and arrival in this city,
of a young rowdy named James Finnegan, who it
is thought may know something of the Mary
Rogers affair. We see that most of the papers
state he is detained on suspicion of having
been concerned in that tragedy. This is not true.
He is charged with having committed an aggrava-
ted assault on Miss Mary J. Toole in the upper
part of this city some time since, and this is the
only crime for which he is under arrest. The
Albany Atlas states that several prostitutes were
brought before the authorities of that city on Mon-
day, and that one of them said that Finnegan
showed her a ring with the name of Mary C. Ro-
gers upon it. This is all the evidence which tends
in the least to implicate him in that affair; and
taking into consideration the infamous character of
the witness, and the extreme improbability that
any man could be so foolish as to wear publicly a
ring marked with the name of any one whom he
had murdered, the suspicion that he knows any
thing of the affair of Mary Rogers may well be
pronounced without any good foundation.

<b>The Late Horrible Murder—Arraignment
	and Plea of the Prisoner.</b>
   As we stated in yesterday's Herald, John Caldwell
Colt, charged with the murder of Samuel Adams,
was brought into the Court of Oyer and Terminer,
yesterday morning, before Judge Kent, and Alder-
men Leonard and Woodhull.
   The Court room was crowded to suffocation by
respectable persons eager to see Colt. A. M. C.
Smith and another brought him through the Sheriff's
office, heavily ironed. His heavy irons were here
taken off, and he was brought into Court with his
hands handcuffed behind him, under his coat tail.
These were taken off in the Court room, and he sat
down by the side of his counsel, <u>Emmett</u> and Mor-
rill. Colt was very pale, and his face was even more
haggard than before. He was quite cool, and col-
lected, and firm; but he sighed heavily and fre-
quently, and he had evidently suffered intensely du-
ring his confinement.
   The District Attorney rose soon after he was
brought in, and said, “I now move that John C.
Colt be arraigned for the charge of murdering
Samuel Adams.”
   T<small>HE</small> C<small>LERK</small> (Henry Vandervoort)—John C. Colt,
stand up.
   The prisoner stood up.
   C<small>LERK</small>—Hold up your right hand.
   He did so.
   C<small>LERK</small>—Now put it down again.
   He did so, and sat down.
   C<small>LERK</small>—Now stand up again.
   He stood up much agitated.
   C<small>LERK</small>—Listen to the indictment that has been

   The Clerk then read the following verbatim:

<m9>   The jurors of the people of State of New York in and
for the body of the city and county of New York, upon
their oath present: That John C. Colt, late of the third ward
of the city of New York, in the county of New York afore-
said, laborer, not having the fear of God before his
eyes, but being moved and seduced by the instigation of
the devil, on the 17th day of September, in the year of
our Lord one thousand eight hundred and forty-one, with
force and arms at the ward, city and county aforesaid,
in and upon one Samuel Adams, in the peace of God and
of the said people then and there being feloniously, wil-
fully and of his malice aforethought, did make an as-
sault, and that the said John C. Colt, with a certain
hatchet, of the value of six cents, which he, the said
John C. Colt, in his right hand then and there had and
held the said Samuel Adams, in and upon the right side
of the head of him, the said Samuel Adams, then and
there feloniously, wilfully and of his malice afore-
thought, did strike and cut, giving to him, the said Sa-
muel Adams, then and there, with the hatchet aforesaid,
in and upon the right side of the head of him, the said
Samuel Adams, one mortal wound of the breadth of three
inches, and of the depth of six inches, of which said mor-
tal wound he, the said Samuel Adams, then and there in-
stantly died. And so the jurors aforesaid, upon their
oath aforesaid, do say that the said John C. Colt, him, the
said Samuel Adams, in manner and form aforesaid, felo-
niously, wilfully and of his malice aforethought, did kill
and murder against the form of the statute in such case
made and provided, and against the peace of the people of
the State of New York and their dignity.

   During the reading of this paper, the prisoner
changed countenance considerably; his face became
flushed, and then deadly pale; and his eye was very
restless, and flashed fire. As soon as he had got
through reading the indictment, the Clerk said, “Do
you demand a trial upon this indictment?”
   Colt's lips quivered, and he was about to reply,
but apparently the words stuck in his throat, like
Macbeth's “Amen.”
   <u>E<small>MMETT</small></u>.—Yes, sir, we demand a trial.
   C<small>LERK</small>.—Do you plead guilty, or not guilty?
   The prisoner faintly said, “Not guilty.”
   <u>E<small>MMETT</small></u>.—We plead not guilty, sir.
   J<small>UDGE</small> K<small>ENT</small>.—When will you be ready for trial?
During the present term of the Court?
   <u>E<small>MMETT</small></u>.—It is impossible for us to say when we
shall be ready, on account of the great excitement
that prevails; we cannot name any particular day.
   W<small>HITING</small>.—I wish counsel for prisoner to under-
stand distinctly that I intend to dispose of this case
during the present term. There is no good ground
for a postponement; and I therefore move the Court
that it be set down for Monday week. If the <u title="prisoner's">pri-
soners'</u> counsel are not ready to go on with it on that
day, let them give me three day's notice, and I shall
be willing to grant any reasonable indulgence.
   J<small>UDGE</small> K<small>ENT</small>.—Then we assign Monday week for
the day of trial in this cause.
   W<small>HITING</small>.—I desire the counsel to understand that
I shall press this case on to trial on that day.
   <u>E<small>MMETT</small></u>.—Very well, sir.
   The prisoner's eye lighted up, and he watched
every word as it fell from Whiting's lips; but was
very calm. He was then removed to the Sheriff's
office, ironed, and sent back to the Egyptian Tombs.

<b>The Murder of Adams—Progress of Crime.</b>
M<small>R.</small> B<small>ENNETT</small>—
   S<small>IR</small>:—
   The odium that would appear to attach to authors,
or literary men, from the simple fact of Colt, the
murderer, being the reputed author of a system of
book-keeping, should have no weight. Any person
who will take the trouble to compare Colt's Book-
keeping with Bennett's Book-keeping, will at once
see that Colt is but a <i>literary pirate</i>, and, of course,
does not class among original writers. It requires
but a small quantum of talent in a mere mechanical
book-keeper, to alter, mangle, and copy an original
work, for the purpose of infringing on another man's
copy-right. But Colt is not the only person who
has pirated the work alluded to. The great popu-
larity of Bennett's Book-keeping has called forth,
within the last twenty years, a number of wicked
pirates, among whom is a convict of the name of
Hitchcock, of whose crime, (forgery) conviction
and sentence to the <u>States</u> Prison, we have a certi-
ficate from that great workhouse, accurately describ-
ing his person, which shall be published should oc-
casion require. It is most natural progress in crime,
<i>forgery, piracy and murder</i>. If then such men are
to be classed among literary and scientific authors,
we must say that “Othello's occupation is gone.”
   But what has appeared to us most astonishing is,
that booksellers of respectability have been known
to keep such books on sale, after due notice that
they were infringements on original copy-right.—
Nothing but the pacific disposition of the real au-
thor, however, has saved them from the fangs of
the law.
   The Harlot's Progress, by Hogarth, and the Gam-
bler's Fate, are among the finest warning lessons that
were ever offered to vice, this side the gallows. Men
seldom break out into the commission of high crimes
suddenly. Conscience, that monitor given by the
Almighty, to warn men against the violation of hu-
man and divine law, must first be blunted or deafened
by the smaller class of crimes and misdemeanors,
before the soul becomes fit for the commission of
the higher crimes of robbery, rape and murder. We
are perfectly aware, however, that there are many
minds so constituted or guarded, either by a princi-
ple of religion, or a principle of honor, or from both,
that they can never be led into base or vicious con-
duct, being shocked at the first appearance or sugges-
tion of wickedness. But when the greater number
are on the other side, they should take warning not
to lose their conscience, nor persuade themselves
that there are neither rewards nor punishments be-
yond the grave.				J<small>UNIUS</small>.

   T<small>HE</small> M<small>ARY</small> R<small>OGERS</small> M<small>YSTERY</small>.—The people who profess
to be acquainted with all the secret moves of the indefa-

rested in Albany, are not charged with the murder of
the pretty segar girl, but with attempting to ravish Mary
Jane Toole, the girl who was taken out of a boat by a
gang of juvenile soaplocks who had “No. 27” on their
belts or braces. Miss Mary Jane is in safe keeping, but
she confidently asserts that she was not ravished nor ill
used. The parties in custody on this charge now amount
to five, and they are kept apart, whilst their arrest and
the nature of the charge against them is so far consider-
ed as a “cabinet secret,” that even the advice of a law-
yer has hitherto been denied them.

   D<small>EPARTURE OF THE</small> R<small>USSIAN</small> W<small>AR</small> S<small>TEAMER</small>
<u title="KAMCHATKA">K<small>AMSCHATKA</small></u>.—We yesterday morning went on
board this magnificent vessel to pay our respects
to her for the last time, and to see her under way
for St. Petersburgh. Never was a ship in more
complete trim from stem to stern. Her size, ton-
nage and machinery, we have before described,
and need not again repeat. Take her all in all,
we do not believe there is in the whole world a
more perfect specimen of naval architecture.—
Her neatness and beauty are only equalled by her
wonderful strength and solidity. Her furniture is
of the most rich and splendid character, corres-
ponding with her superiority in all other respects.
   In passing through the midst of her gigantic ma-
chinery one seems to be lost in a forest of polish-
ed iron and brass. Her armament is of the most
effective description. On her forward gun deck
she carries ten 24 pounders, and on her stern gun
deck eight 24 pounders. On her forward upper
deck she carries three tremendous <u title="Paixhans (elsewhere)">Paxham</u> guns,
and one on her stern, which will make cruel work
with any thing that ever attempts to chase her.—
The guns upon the upper decks are all placed
upon circular railways, so they can instantly
be pointed in any direction that may be desired.
   A great number of our citizens attended her as
far as the Hook, and she started on her watery
way with all the usual accompaniments of salutes,
cheers, and good wishes. We can only imagine
the delight with which the Emperor will receive
her into his service. She will be the lion of his
navy. She sails from here under American col-
ors, not having yet been formally delivered to the
Russian government. Of course the officers who
will hereafter command her are not yet appointed.
The following is a list of those under whom she
goes out:—
   George Schuyler, American, Commander.
   Capt. Von Schantz, Russian Navy.
   1st Lieut. Flotoff, do.
   2d. Lieut. <u title="Scharoubine, Scheronbine (elsewhere)">Sherburne</u>, do.

other, was exhibited on Monday, before the Police
Court of Boston. A German named Hohnholz,
officiating as pastor of a German congregation, was
brought up on a charge of immorality. The wit-
ness against him was a German girl named Regi-
na <u title="Heilnich, Heilnisch, Hellmich (elsewhere)">Heilmich</u>, who deposed in substance that Hohn-
holz met her in the street—offered to find a place
at which she could go into service—took her to his
boarding house—made love to her—persuaded her
that he was authorized to marry himself to her—
took her into his room and made a prayer, which
he represented as equivalent to the marriage
ceremony, and then made her accompany him to
Salem, where they passed the night as man and
wife.
   Returning the next day he locked her up in
his room and kept her from Friday to Sunday
morning, when he took her to his church and
preached as usual. The poor girl was firmly
convinced that she was lawfully married to her
betrayer. We presume that the upshot of the
matter will be a more efficient marriage secundum
artem.

   T<small>HE</small> R<small>USSIAN</small> S<small>TEAMSHIP</small>.—The <u title="Kamchatka">Kamschatka</u>,
a steamship built for the Russian government, left
this harbor yesterday, on her passage for the ship-
ping port of St. Petersburg. The <i>Express</i> says:
   “This ship is purely American, having been
built by our best skilled <u title="artisans">artizans</u>, and as a ship, a-
side from her steam power, is one of the most ex-
traordinary hulls and models that has ever been put
together in any country. The strength and beau-
ty of this vessel is a subject of admiration of our
most experienced nautical men. Nothing can sur-
pass her strength. Her timbers, knees, ceiling,
deck plank, beams, &c., are put together with a de-
gree of nice workmanship, and fit, that would do
credit to cabinet work.
   Her machinery is of a finish and perfection that
it appears impossible to surpass; nothing can excel
its performance. Indeed, as a ship of war, too much
cannot be said in her praise. She took her final
departure yesterday, on which occasion a very large
party of gentlemen were invited to accompany her
to sea. In two hours after she tripped her anchor,
off the Powles' Hook Ferry, she was abreast of San-
dy Hook. As she passed the wharves and the
various ships of war, and along the shores of our
bay and harbor, crowds assembled to witness her
departure. On reaching Hook, the party were
transferred to the steamboat Jersey City, (where a
most sumptuous and beautiful collation was pre-
pared,) and brought to the city. When the party
left the frigate, hearty cheers were interchanged,
and the frigate passed rapidly to sea, and was soon
lost sight of.”
   The gentlemen who have contracted for, and who
have built this vessel, are Messrs. R & G. <u title="L. (elsewhere)">S.</u> Schuy-
ler, under whose entire inspection and direction she
has been built. Mr. Wm. H. Brown is the builder
of the ship, and Mr. Dunham the engineer. On deck
she carries two <u title="Paixhans (elsewhere)">Paixham</u> guns, that will throw a <s>96</s>
pound ball, besides two <s>32</s> pounders,—on her main
deck she has twelve 32 pounders.

   <i>A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing</i>.—An extraordinary
piece of roguery was developed yesterday. A pre-
tended German preacher, in clerical attire, was brought
up for a very singular offence. His name is Henry
<s title="Hohnholz (elsewhere)">Ho??holz</s>, and he has been preaching in Boston to
irregular congregations of his countrymen. He hails
from the interior of Pennsylvania. On Wednesday
last he fell in with a superstitious German girl, and
affected to take an interest in her, and got her a
place in a German family. In the course of that
evening and the next day, he persuaded her that he
was inspired by God to claim her as his wife, and
kept praying with her, and he made her believe that
he had the power to marry <u title="himself (elsewhere)">herself</u> by their both go-
ing through certain acts of devotion. On Thursday
afternoon, he took her to a tavern out of town, and
consummated his purpose, and cohabited with her till
Sunday, and even introduced her as his wife to some
Germans, into whose society he had contrived to
<u title="thrust">thurst</u> himself.
   A family connexion of the girl found out what had
taken place, and went to a house in South Boston
where she was, and took her away. The scoundrel
then made preparations to run away, but Constable
Burns was upon him in the evening, and secured him,
but not before he had felt the weight of the preach-
er's knuckles. He was committed to jail for trial at
the Municipal Court. The girl's name is <u title="Heilnich, Heilnisch, Heilmich, Hellmich (elsewhere)">Heilnick</u>.

   T<small>HE</small> A<small>RREST AT</small> A<small>LBANY</small>.—For the information
of those who still steadfastly contend that the ar-
rest of James Finnegan in Albany, was for the
murder of Mary C. Rogers, we again take the lib-
erty of stating that his arrest <i>was not</i> on that
charge.
   From J. B. La Forge, Esq. the counsel of Fin-
negan, we derive the information that his client was
arrested, and is now in prison, on a charge of hav-
ing attempted the commission of an assault some
months since on a young girl of this city, named
Jane Ann <u title="Toole (elsewhere)">Tool</u>, but did not succeed in the un-
dertaking, and that there is no other charge what-
ever against him. That on Sunday the 25th July,
the day on which Mary C. Rogers was murdered,
Finnegan, who is a private coachman, drove part of
his respectable employer's family to church, both
morning and evening, and was not out of the City
that day—that on the night on which the frail girl at
Albany charged that he was with her and gave her
a ring with the name of Mary C. Rogers upon it,
Finnegan accompanied his mother (who resides in
Albany,) to church, again accompanied her home
and remained in the house with her all that night.
Of all this the proof is so conclusive that we under-
stand both the Mayor and Justice Taylor, une-
quivocally declare that there is not the slightest
reason for believing the Finnegan had any partici-
pation whatever in the violation or murder of Mary
C. Rogers. His own sins he should answer for—
not for those of others.

   <i>The arrest at Albany</i>.—Notwithstanding the con-
tradictions that have appeared, some of the papers
still continue to assert, that the arrest of James Fin-
negan at Albany, by the New York Police—was on a
charge of being concerned in the murder of Mary C.
Rogers. This we again positively affirm was not the
case. From Mr. J. B. La Forge, the counsel of Fin-
negan, we assured that his client was arrested,
<i>solely</i>, on a charge of having attempted the perpetra-
tion of an outrage on a young girl (not Miss Rogers)
in which attempt he was unsuccessful. That Finne-
gan who recently was employed as a private coach-
man by one of our most respectable citizens—on the
day of the murder of Miss Rogers, drove a portion of
his employers' family to church, both for the morning
and evening service, and that he was not out of the city
that day. That on the night on which he was charged
by the dissolute female at Albany, with having been
with her and given her a ring, bearing the name of
M. C. Rogers—he accompanied his mother (who re-
sides in Albany) to church, returned with her home,
and remained in the house with her the whole night.
And so conclusive do the Mayor and Justice Taylor,
consider the evidence of the innocence of Finnegan
of all participation in the violation and murder of Miss
Rogers, that they unequivocally declare their convic-
tion of it—and concur with the counsel in stating that
there is not the least suspicion of his guilt, in con-
nection with that affair. On the other charge he will
be examined in two or three days.

   T<small>HE</small> M<small>ARY</small> R<small>OGERS</small> M<small>YSTERY</small>.—The indefatigables who
were despatched to Albany, to arrest Finnegan, deny
that they informed any body there that they had found
a ring with the name of Mary C. Rogers on it. They
say the <u title="tarradiddle">tarrididdle</u> originated thus. On bringing Finne-
gan down to the boat one of the corps said to him “here
let us look at that ring you have on your finger, perhaps
that is one of Mary Rogers's rings, as she had several.”
The manacled soaplock of course complied, and this be-
ing carried quick as thought to a newspaper, got con-
verted into a most important chain of circumstantial tes-
timony against Finnegan, viz: that the ring had not
only belonged to the pretty cigar girl, but that it had her
name on it. So much for <u title="tarradiddles">tarrididdles</u>.
   T<small>HE LAST</small> M<small>URDER</small>.—The key of Colt's room in the gra-
nite buildings is held by the Mayor, who with Colt's
counsel, have been engaged there daily, making a strict
search after papers, or any other documents which may
throw a light on his career. Surely it may be said of
Colt in the language of scripture, “<u title="Cain: My punishment is greater than I can bear. / My guilt is too great to bear.">my guilt is already
greater than I can bear.</u>”

<f12><b>Murder in New York, of Samuel Adams,
			Printer.</b></f12>
   Our city has again been the theatre of a most startling
and murderous tragedy. Though less horrible in its de-
tails than the hideous outrage and murder of Miss Mary
	...
He was an honest, industrious, temperate and religious
man, highly respected by all who knew him. His age
was not far from 35.

   [The grand jury being in session, Colt was indicted
on Tuesday last, for the wilful murder of Samuel Ad-
ams, and was arraigned on the indictment. Time was
granted him until the next morning, to plead. The pri-
soner's behavior was calm and firm. He is the son of
Christopher Colt, of Hartford, the late president of the
Silk Manufacturing Company of that city. A sister of
Colt, committed suicide in 1837.]

<d>[Col.1. Partly in <a class="e" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=cWcTAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA236">Hazard's ... Register. October 18, 1841</a>]</d>
   <i>The <u>Kamschatka</u></i>.—We mentioned yesterday that
this noble steam Frigate, built in this city for the
Russian Government, and the largest ever construct-
ed, being larger than the British Frigates <i>Cyclops</i> or
<i>Gorgon</i>—went to sea on Wednesday. At the time
she was launched, we went somewhat at large into
a description of her, since which period, we are sorry
to perceive an effort on the part of an unscrupulous
print, to take from the Messrs. S<small>CHUYLER</small>, the credit
of having constructed this unrivalled steamer, in the
hope of conferring it all or in part, upon the Russian
officers who were sent here to overlook the work, and
one that it was in all respects equal to the contract.
   The history of the ship is briefly as follows. On
Captain <u title="Von Schantz">V<small>AN</small> C<small>HANCE</small></u>'s first visit to the United
States, Mr. G<small>EORGE</small> L. S<small>CHUYLER</small> furnished him with
the drawings of the <i>lines</i> of a frigate, which had been
tendered to our Government and <i>rejected</i>. The Capt.
on his second visit, brought with him an order for
the construction of a frigate according to <i>lines</i>, to be
furnished by him, and which had been prepared in Rus-
sia—the engines to be whatever the Messrs. S<small>CHUY-
LER</small> might determine upon. After various inter-
views between the parties, the Messrs. S<small>CHUYLER</small> in-
timated that if the Russian captain adhered to his
Russian model for the hull of the frigate, all negoti-
ation between them might or will cease, as they
would not build a ship after the model proposed. This
resulted in a compromise; and the Messrs. S<small>CHUY-
LER</small> shortly after presented the <i>present</i> model for ap-
proval, which preserves the beautiful round stern, and
as much as practicable, of the upper works of the
Russian lines; but all of which form below the wa-
ter line, is entirely and exclusively the American mo-
del varied according to the skill and judgment of
Messrs. R. & G. L. S<small>CHUYLER</small>. For the Engines and
Machinery, they are solely responsible, as they are
for having selected for their construction Messrs. H.
R. D<small>UNHAM</small> & Co., manufacturers, who have no supe-
riors on either side of the water.
   These facts in relation to the <i title="Kamchatka">Kamschatka</i>, very
clearly show that she is in all respects as regards
model for sailing and engines, an <i>American produc-
tion</i>; and we hazard nothing in saying, that she is at
this moment both in hull and machinery, very, very
much superior to any steamer afloat; and while she
is undoubtedly faster than any other war steamer,
we incline to the belief that she will be found quite as
fast as the Great Western or Cunard's steamers, al-
though her power in proportion to her tonnage, is
only about two thirds as great.
   It affords us great pleasure to annex the following
interesting letter from Messrs. H. R. D<small>UNHAM</small> & Co.
				N<small>EW</small> Y<small>ORK</small>, Sept. 30, 1841.
<i>To J. Watson Webb, Esq.</i>:
<l9>   D<small>EAR</small> S<small>IR</small>:—At your kind request of information
about weight and proportions of engines and boilers
for <u>Kamschatka</u>, steam ship, for the Russian Govern-
ment, we have prepared the following statement:
   The engines are two in number, each cylinder being
62 in. diameter and 10 ft. stroke, lying horizontal and
are placed in the bottom of the ship. The motion of
the piston rod is communicated in the ordinary man-
ner to a hanging beam of a triangular form; one angle
of which receives the link from crosshead and the
other passes the power to the cranks through the
connecting rod. The engine is technically known
as the Half Beam Engine. The whole of the work-
ing parts are included and supported by a connected
cast iron frame twenty-six feet long and twenty-four
feet wide, and firmly secured by wrought iron bolts
and stays, passing in the several directions of the
strains and through the entire bottom of the ship.—
The whole of the engines and frames were fitted by
machinery and were not tried together until set
in their places on board the ship, and so accurate,
that no one piece required fitting on board.
   The shafts and cranks are of wrought iron and
weighed rough 38 tons, and when finished 30 tons.
The water wheels are also of wrought iron and weigh
32 tons. The engines are worked by double balanced
valves, with a double pair of the same, for cutting off
the steam in the cylinders; being arranged so easily of
adjustment, as to require but five minutes to set or
alter them to cut off at any given part of the stroke;
the cams being graduated from one to seven-tenth
parts of the stroke; the whole being so simple and
effective as to easily set by one of the ordinary
firemen.
   The boilers are of copper, and four in number, built
on the flue and tubular principle, and possessing in
an eminent degree, the advantages of both. The
tubes receive the heat direct from the furnaces, and
from them it passes through large flues in its passage
to the chimney. The boilers are intended to burn
anthracite coal without the use of blowers, and which
in her trial, proved entirely satisfactory, though
much lighter in proportion to the cylinders, than
most boilers in use with blowers. The boilers with
smoke pipe and breeching for the same, weigh about
90 tons. The whole of the engines and boilers to-
gether with nearly all her fuel for St. Petersburg or
Cronstadt are included in two wrought iron bulkheads
placed at each end and measuring apart 70 feet. The
engines and boilers were manufactured by Messrs.
Dunham and Co., of this city, under the inspection
and from the plans of R. & G. L. Schuyler, engineers
and agents for Steamer <u title="Kamchatka">Kamscatka</u>.
   Length of ship at water line		210 feet.
   Breadth of beam						36 “
   Depth of hold						24 “
   Diameter of water wheels			30 “
   Reefed when leaving port to		28 “
   Length of Bucket					9 “ 6 in.
   Dip of	do							5 “ 6 “
   Diameter of shaft journals			1 “ 4 “
   Total weight of the engine and boilers about 450
tons, of which there are about 235 tons cast iron,
120 tons wrought iron, and 95 tons copper and com-
position. The whole has been under work nomi-
nally about eighteen months, but in reality not over
twelve; the preparations necessary for such an un-
dertaking requiring several months for their comple-
tion. But we could now build another from the
same parts and finished ready for operation in ten
months from commencement.
   There has been employed in building the engines,
boilers and appurtenances an average of two hundred
and fifty hands for eight months, besides the numer-
ous <u title="planing">plaining</u> mills, lathes and other machinery used in
operation, and we are now prepared to execute orders
for engines for steam ships up to 3000 tons, with all
the machinery necessary for immediate use in the
manufacturing of the different parts of the engine as
well as for the light river boats engines, and all we re-
quire is but a liberal and fair encouragement to pro-
duce as good work in this city as can be made in any
part of the world.	Respectfully, yours,
				  H. R. DUNHAM & CO.</l9>
	<i title="Partly">From the American of Thursday</i>.
   T<small>HE</small> <u>K<small>AMSCHATKA</small></u> war steamer, built for the Rus-
sian government, went to sea yesterday, about 12
o'clock.
   This fine vessel—perhaps the finest in the world
of her class—was built in this city under the care
and superintendence of Messrs. Robert and George
Schuyler, by whom the <u title="modeling (in American)">modelling</u> of the hull and the
arrangement of the machinery were mainly devised
and regulated.
   The builder was Mr. <i>Wm. H. Brown</i>, and by com-
mon consent, it seems to be admitted that a more
beautiful craft never sat upon the water. So perfect,
indeed, are her proportions, and so admirable the
workmanship, that even unaccustomed eyes are at
once struck with her fitness and finish. She mea-
sures about 2,000 tons.
   The machinery was constructed by <i>Dunham &
Co.</i>, and it too seemed to us, as we watched its work-
ing, to be as complete a piece of work as can well be
put up.
   Mr. Geo. Schuyler who went out in charge of the
vessel, invited a numerous party of friends to accom-
pany him to the Hook, to see the working of the
ship; and abundantly were they gratified. We ran
down from the anchorage in the North River to the
Hook in about 2 hours—the engine gaining power as
we proceeded and as steam accumulated, but not
making, while we were on board, more than 9 revo-
lutions, which gave about the same number of miles
for her speed. She will, however, as she is lightened
reach probably 12 or 13 revolutions, and attain a
speed unequalled by any war steamer.
   While under way, no one could imagine that we
were propelled by Steam power and ponderous ma-
chinery, so free was the vessel from vibration, and so
smoothly and silently did the machines work.
   Arrived <u title="off">of</u> the Hook, the company went on board
the <i><u title="Arisseoh, Jersey City (elsewhere)">Aressoah</u></i> steam ferry boat which had accompa-
nied us, and giving three hearty cheers to the noble
<u>Kamschatka</u>, and uttering many patriotic wishes that
this fine American vessel might have a prosperous
voyage, we returned to the city, finding on board the
<u>Aressoah</u>, provided by the forethought of Mr. Schuy-
ler, a most sumptuous entertainment, in the enjoy-
ment of which by his friends, he was freshly remem-
bered.
   We just learn that when the Pilot, Mr. Vosburg,
left the ship, she had a head of 10 inches of steam,
(the utmost when we left her was about 3 inches)
and that she was going off at a flying rate.

		<b>Colt, the Homicide.</b>
   The trial of this wretched man is approaching, and
the interest in the awful tragedy, in which he was an
actor, will not subside, until it is past, and he is
handed over to the ministers of justice.
   No doubt appears to exist that he took the life of
Adams. The only question seems to be whether it
was done with that deliberation and “malice afore-
thought,” which constitute the crime of murder, and
call for the doom of death; or whether it was a
homicide, committed in a whirlwind of sudden and
uncontrollable passion, calling only for a verdict of
manslaughter, and some years' incarceration in the
gloomy cells of a penitentiary.
   Upon the examination, before the coroner, Colt
seemed like a man just wakened from some horri-
ble dream. His pale and quivering lips, his glaring
eyes, knit brows, and the beating of his forehead
with his clenched hand, all showed the agony of a
mind roused from its fancied security, with all the
fearful evidences of crime staring him in the face.
   When the wife of the slain man passed by him
that day, the look she gave him was such as one as
few ever received from mortal. It seemed to freeze
the prisoner into stone. He glared upon her like
Macbeth upon the ghost of Banquo. She walked
as if a spirit moved her. Her face was deadly pale—
her eyes past weeping. She seemed to look into
eternity—she stood, as if she was confronting the
man of blood before the bar of doom.
   No mimic tragedy ever came up to that scene in
real life. It was a calm, bright Sabbath evening,
the sun shining in the blue heavens, and the deeply
verdant foliage of the Park, was in a glow of beau-
ty; yet in its midst was the dead house, with the
mangled and decaying corpse of the murdered man,
and close by the man accused of the crime in all the
remorse of discovered guilt, and the widow in her
pale and tearless agony! And all around, filling the
atmosphere, filling the lungs alike of prisoner and
witness, was the horrible effluvia of the mouldering
dead.
   Can it be wondered that that woman is now a ma-
niac? Warned as she was—three times, did she
dream, that her husband was murdered, and waked
to find him beside her, for most true it is, she was
thus strangely warned—her mind could not hear the
dreadful reality, and though expecting the blow,
she could not bear it. Her reason is a shattered
wreck, and it is probable that she will soon lie
peacefully beside her husband in the quiet grave.

a gentleman who arrived in town from Alba-
ny this morning, that a very important arrest
has been <u title="effected">affected</u> in that city by two New
York officers. An individual for whom they
had been in search two weeks—and against

discovered by them on Sunday evening, and
taken into custody early the next morning.—
He will of course be brought on to this city
as privately as possible, and examined before
the Mayor.'
   The Albany Atlas of Tuesday says that
<u title="Finnegan (elsewhere)">Finegan</u>, the individual arrested, had in his
possession a ring with the name of Mary C.

arrested on the charge of being engaged in

have met with the following in the N. Y. Sun
of Friday last:
<l9>   T<small>HE</small> A<small>RREST OF</small> F<small>INNEGAN IN</small> A<small>LBANY</small>.—
Although repeated repetitions of the charge
that James Finnegan was arrested at Albany
for being concerned in the murder of Miss
Rogers have been published, yet as some of
the papers still persevere in the error, that
such was the cause of his arrest we again
take occasion to state that he was arrested on
a charge of attempting the commission of an
outrage on the person of another young fe-
male of this city, in which attempt he did
not succeed. Mr. J. B. La Forge, the coun-
sel of <u title="Finnegan">Finnogan</u>, assures us that he was ar-
rested solely for this attempt, and not for any
injury to or destruction of Miss Rogers, of
which latter foul offence there is abundant
evidence of his innocence. There is proof
conclusive that on the Sunday of the murder
of Miss Rogers, Finnegan, (who was until
recently a private coachman of one of our
most respectable artizans) drove a portion of
his employer's family to church both for
morning and evening worship, and was in
the city the entire day.
   That on the night charged by the abandon-
ed female at Albany, as having spent the
night with her and given her a ring bearing
the name of Mary C. Rogers—he accompa-
nied his mother, who resides in Albany to
and from church, and remained during the
whole night in the house with her. In the
entire innocence of Finnegan of all concern
in the murder of Mary C. Rogers, the Mayor
and Justice Taylor, who have examined the
subject, express their unequivocal and firm
conviction. Finnegan will be examined, in
two or three days, on the charge for which
he was arrested, and if the evidence be suffi-
cient will be committed to answer for that of-
fence.</l9>

<i>Shocking murder of Mr. Adams—our Printer—the
   body discovered on board a vessel—arrest of the
   supposed Murderer, and observations on the charac-
   ter of both, showing them to be the creatures of cir-
   cumstances</i>.

   Mr. Samuel Adams, of the firm of <u title="Scatcherd">Scatchard</u> & Ad-
ams, printers, 59 Gold street, has been murdered. He
was last seen alive at the office of the “Missionary Her-
ald,” about 4 or 5 on the afternoon of Friday, Sept.
17th, where he went to take a proof. It was rumored
that he was met by an acquaintance in Broadway about
5 P. M. that afternoon, who said to him, “Colt is go-
ing to leave the city.” To which, he is said to have
replied, “Is he, then I'll go and get the money he owes
me from him.” He went then, it is said, in the direc-
tion of Colt's place of business, which is the second
story of the granite buildings, corner of Chambers st.
and Broadway. The Colt here spoken of is J. C.
Colt, author of a “Treatise on Book-keeping,” and
brother of Mr. Colt, the celebrated inventor of the re-
peating rifles and pistols.
	...
   Mr. A. H. Wheeler, an eminent writing master,
whose rooms in the same building nearly adjoin that
of Colt's was the person who gave the information
which led to the detection of this most foul murder.
<d>[Col.2]</d>
Just before four o'clock on the Friday afternoon, he
heard a severe tussle between some persons in Colt's
room. Presently there was a heavy fall upon the floor
	...
   Mr. Wheeler enquired—“What was the cause of
the disturbance here this afternoon, Mr. Colt.”
   Colt (apparently agitated<u title=")">(</u>—“I know of no distur-
bance—I heard no disturbance.”
   Wheeler—“I thought you were scuffling here as
though some one had attacked you—I certainly heard
some person fall upon the floor a couple of hours since.”
   Colt—“There has been no scuffling here to-day—
you are mistaken.”
   Wheeler—“There was a quarrel or scuffle here of
some kind, I am sure—and I know it was in this
room.”
   Colt—“Perhaps you heard the upsetting of the
desk—nothing more, I assure you. One of my
scholars accidentally upset his desk a short time ago,
and has deluged the floor with ink. I am not aware of
any other noise.”
   Mr. Wheeler then retired, but he was by no means
satisfied. The appearance and actions of Colt rather
confirmed his suspicions than otherwise. He therefore
communicated the circumstances to a young man in
his employ, and requested that he would watch the
movements of Colt the remainder of the time he
stayed in his room. This task the young man per-
formed with the greatest fidelity. Late in the evening,
he became so convinced by his observation that there
was a murdered man in Colt's room, that he actually
went to the City Prison and applied for the services of
an officer. Little notice was taken of his application,
though we believe he obtained the promise that one
should be in attendance in half an hour—but the
officer never came! So much for <i>our efficient police</i>.
   On his return from the prison, the young man heard
Colt sawing some boards, and presently nailing up a
box. At last becoming tired of watching, he retired
to bed at an early hour in the morning, leaving Colt
still engaged in his room.
<d>[<a class="e" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=IWM2AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA141">p.141</a>, Col.1 / Partly as in <a href="#Herald-1841-09-28-2">Herald</a>]</d>
   On the following morning, a large box was observed
	...
   He shortly came in, and while in act of unlocking
his door, was seized on both his arms by the iron grasp
of Smith. It was expected he would make resistance,
	...
<d>[Col.2]</d>
cover himself to speak audibly. Colt was then taken
to the Mayor's office; and, as it will be seen, his re-
plies to the interrogatories put to him, went fully to
confirm the suspicions previously entertained.
	...
<d>[<a class="e" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=IWM2AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA142">p.142</a>, Col.1 / Partly as in <a href="#Tribune-1841-09-28">Tribune</a>]</d>
13 Chambers st., and printed by Mr. Adams the un-
fortunate deceased. He is a man of small means, and
the difficult task of getting up a book with little or no
money, can be easily imagined. When he applied to
Mr. Adams to print his work, he made an arrangement
to the effect that Mr. A. should receive his pay out of
the first sales. The book was accordingly printed and
	...
cide. We believe it is not true, as has been stated, that
he has a brother who is Cashier of the Hartford Bank;
that gentleman, whose name is Colt, being at best but
a distant relative.
	...
   That was a dreadful mistake of Mr. Colt's. Such a
secret is safe nowhere. The whole creation of God has
neither nook nor corner for its safety from detection,
even by men. How true, therefore, is the adage,
<d>[Col.2]</d>
“Murder, though it hath no tongue, will speak with
most miraculous organs.” In this instance, speedy
detection has overtaken the guilty man in a most mira-
culous manner. In ordinary cases of murder a thou-
sand eyes turn at once to explore every man, every
	...
fruits of whose “foul flowering” he is now to reap!
	...
   Mr. Adams has for some time past printed our pa-
per. We have always found him to be a man of plain
and inoffensive manners, of rather a bilious tempera-
ment, and therefore slow to act; a favorable organiza-
tion for the business in which he somewhat excelled, at
<d>[<a class="e" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=IWM2AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA143">p.143</a>, Col.1]</d>
least in management, if not in mechanically. He had
seven or eight presses, and carried on a large business.
He had large acquisitiveness, consequently inclined to
economy. Large secretiveness, small language, and
of course not very communicative, and not very likely
to excite his murder. He is a native of New Eng-
land, of respectable parents, and we always found him
a pleasant man to do business with.
   We regret his death, for he promised to be of use to
our cause in affording facilities in publishing our paper,
and whether we shall meet with a printer with similar
kindness, remains a matter of question.
   He has been the creature of circumstances over
which he had no control. If he had possessed <i>free
will</i> as many suppose, we doubt not but that he would
have preferred another kind of death, and at another
time; but alas what helpless and dependent creatures
we are, although we talk so loud and long about our
<i>free will</i>. We leave our favorite Printer, not doubting
but that he is perfectly free from all those corroding
cares, and vexatious circumstances and influences, and
opposing interests of the present vitiated state of so-
ciety.

   <f15><b>MURDERS, &C.</b></f15>
	AWFUL MURDER.
   One of the most dreadful murders
that ever fell to our lot to record, was
committed yesterday at the Almshouse,
Cambridgeport. The victim was a
beautiful young woman, by the name of
Sarah Stevenson. The murderer is a
miserable looking old man, named W.
H. Britton. Sarah was admitted into
the Almshouse in June last, suffering
with a complaint termed 'passage of
gall stones.' She was fast recovering
and would have been discharged in a
few days. About a fortnight back she
complained to Mr. Valentine, the Super-
intendent, that Britton, who was tea-
cher in the house, annoyed her with im-
portunities to marry him; and was ad-
vised to give a decided denial. She
afterwards told Mr. Valentine that she
had done so, but he still persisted.
   In answer to his entreaties she said
to him, you must be mad to think of
such a thing. Consider the difference
in age. I am but twenty years old and
you are sixty, and if I was to marry
you a pauper, how should we live? Mr.
Valentine desired her to tell him that
it was his express desire that he should
not speak to her again on that subject,
and in order that she might be enabled
to keep out of his way, told her to spend
her leisure time in his, Mr. Valentine's
apartments. Yesterday the inmates of
the house attended Divine Service, when
the prisoner who had been acting as
teacher in the establishment sang ac-
companied by the children under his
instruction the hymn, <u title="commencing">commenceing</u>,
“How shall the young secure their
	hearts
And guard their lives from sin,
Thy <u title="word (elsewhere)">words</u> the <u title="choicest">choisest</u> rules imparts
To keep the conscience clean.”
   This Hymn, so beautiful in itself,
was so well and so impressively sung
that at the request of the <u title="Superintendent">Superintend-
ant</u> it was repeated. After the Service
was concluded the inmates went to their
different apartments, and the ill-fated
Sarah, in order to avoid conversation
with Britton, went to a room <u title="occupied">ocupied</u>
by two women, where he could have
no possible excuse for entering. She
was there employed in reading a testa-
ment presented to her on Saturday,
and explaining it to the women, when
Britton suddenly opened the door and
asked her “Is this your room?” Be-
fore she could reply, he drew from un-
der his vest a large carving knife and
made a lunge at her throat.—She
threw up her right arm to ward off the
blow and received it on the fore arm,
leaving a cut four inches long and fully
two deep. One of the women seized
him by the skirt of the coat to pull him
back when he threatened to stab her;—
<d>[Col.4]</d>
in the <u title="interim">intreim</u> Sarah attempted to make
to the door but before reaching it, he
intercepted her, and with one plunge
<small>DROVE THE KNIFE IN ABOVE THE RIGHT
BREAST CLOSE UNDER THE ARM, TRAV-
ERSING THE HEART AND LUNGS AND
COMING OUT UNDER THE SHOULDER-
BLADE AT THE BACK</small>. By this time
the wife of the <u title="Superintendent">Superintendant</u> and an-
other woman, alarmed by the cries of
murder, reached the room, and found
Britton flourishing the bloody knife and
threatening with destruction all who
should dare come nigh him. The only
words spoken by the girl from receiv-
ing the first blow was, “don't kill me.”
On receiving the last wound she fell
dead on her back. The alarm had by
this time spread through the house, and
reached James <u title="Forriter (elsewhere)">Ferrier</u>, the teamster of
the establishment, who hastened in the
direction of the noise, and got to the
room just as Britton was stooping over
the corpse, apparently to kiss her. On
seeing Ferrier, he resumed his threat-
ening attitude, and said if he approach-
ed nearer he would stab him. Ferrier
drew back for a moment, and watching
an opportunity pounced suddenly be-
hind and pinioned the murderer's arms,
who on finding himself secured, imme-
diately dropped the knife and offered
no further resistance.
   An examination was held before
Squire Chamberlain and the above
facts being fully proved, Britton was
committed to jail at East Cambridge.
Sarah Stevenson was a remarkable fine
looking young woman and was univer-
sally esteemed for her good conduct
and kind manner since her entry to the
house.
   The murderer is an under-size, ill-
expressioned man, 57 years of age.
We had this morning an interview with
him at the Jail, and learned from him
that he was born in Halifax, N. S., out
of which port he sailed a ship belonging
to Mr. J. Prive for a number of years.
   There is nothing in his manner or
appearance that would denote insanity.
On the contrary he appears quite col-
lected. Three years back he came to
Boston and was shortly after admitted
into the Almshouse in South Boston, in
a weakly state of health, and continued
there two years, during which time he
was employed as teacher, and was very
much respected.—On the 12th Septem-
ber last year, he was received into the
house at Cambridgeport, and up to yes-
terday was held in high favor by the
<u title="superintendent">superintendant</u> and inmates, for his mild
and gentlemanly behavior. He was
during the last war taken prisoner by
Captain <u title="Crowninshield (elsewhere)">Crowningshield</u> and brought
into Salem. He buried his wife nine
years back, and since that says he has
lived a perfectly virtuous life. On the
subject of the murder he <u title="declines">delines</u> speak-
ing, further than that “he was in love
and cannot account for what he done!!”

   T<small>HE</small> M<small>ARY</small> R<small>OGERS</small> A<small>FFAIR</small>.—We
learn from the Albany Atlas that two
of the persons engaged in a brutal
outrage upon a young women at
Hoboken, on the day it is supposed
Mary Rogers was violated and mur-
dered, were arrested in this city on
Sunday, by officers from New York,
and went down in the De Witt Clin-
ton.
   James Finnegan, one of the per-
sons arrested as above, may possibly
know something about the Mary
Rogers affair. At least we judge so
by the following circumstances: yes-
terday morning, Ald. Simpson made
a haul in the sinks of the First Ward,
and brought up some dozen of the
prostitutes who swarm there. Among
them there was one that said <u title="Finnegan">Fine-
gan</u> had a ring with the name of Mary
C. Rogers on it.—This ring was in
possession of the girl a short time on
Sunday, but was taken from her by
Finnegan. Finnegan is a notorious
character, and some clue in the Rog-
ers mystery may be obtained through
him.

   The Argus says:—
   On Monday, James Finnegan, a
rowdy of confirmed rascality, was
	<a class="l" href="#Daily-Albany-Argus-1841-09-28">...</a>
of F's whereabout, he having left the
city immediately after the murder.

<d>[Col.2]</d>
	...
committed a gross outrage upon a
young girl in this city.

   A<small>N</small> O<small>LD</small> O<small>FFENDER</small>.—In reference
to the case of Finnegan, on a charge
of participation in one or both of the
Hoboken outrages, the Albany Bee
says:
   It will probably be recollected by
the readers of the “Bee” that about a
year ago an act of brutal violence was
committed upon a young girl of about
thirteen years of age, in the stable
belonging to Mr. Cowell, on the dock,
a short distance below the south mar-
ket. Some dozen lads, from 15 to 18
years of age, were arrested at the
time, and after an examination be-
fore justice Kane, several of them
were fully committed for trial. We
do not distinctly recollect what pro-
ceedings were had in the case after
this examination and commitment,
but the girl, having no friends here
and being destitute, we presume that
she was never brought before the
grand jury to substantiate her charge,
and that consequently the prosecu-
tion fell to the ground.—The accused
however, have been active in their
vocation of villainy, and have been
often before the police, on various
charges, and some of them are now
receiving their deserts at Sing Sing.

<d>[Col.3]</d>
Mr. Adams, the printer, formerly doing
business with Mr. Scatcherd, under the
partnership name of Scatcherd and Ad-
ams, which partnership was dissolved,
some time ago by the death of Mr. S.
The firm did the printing of Mr. George
Dearborn, when he was in the publish-
ing line; they were also printers of the
American Monthly Magazine when it
was edited by Mr. Park Benjamin.
   Mr. Adams left his printing office
on Friday the <u title="17">19</u>th, intending to make a
business call in Canal street; and nev-
er returned. His fate and the manner
in which it came upon him are told
in the following dreadful narrative,

   The testimony taken on the inquest
is published in the <a class="l" href="#Courier-1841-09-27">Courier</a>. The
principal witnesses examined were,
Drs. Gilman, Kissam, who made the

   <small>A WOLF IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING</small>.—An <u title="extraordinary">extraor-</u>
piece of roguery was developed yesterday. A
pretended German preacher, in clerical attire,
was brought up for a very singular offence. His
name is Henry Hohnholz, and he had been
preaching in Boston to irregular congregations
of his countrymen. He hails <u title="from">frm</u> the interior of

with a <u title="superstitious">supertitious</u> German girl, and affected to
take an interest in her, and got her a place in a
German family. In the course of that evening
and the next day, he persuaded her that he was
inspired by G<small>OD</small> to claim her as his wife, and
kept praying with her, and made her believe that
he had the power to marry <u title="herself (in Albany Evening Journal)">himself</u> by their both
going through certain acts of devotion. On
Thursday afternoon, he took her to a tavern out
of town, and <u title="consummated">consumated</u> his <u title="purpose">purporse</u>, and co-

ced her as his wife to some Germans, into whose
society he had contrived to thrust himself.
   A family connexion of the girl found out what
had taken place, and went to a house in South
Boston where she was, and took her away. The
scoundrel then made preparations to run away,
but constable Burns was upon him in the even-
ing, and secured him, but not before he had felt
the weight of the preacher's knuckles. He was
committed to jail for trial at the Municipal Court.

   C<small>OLT'S</small> C<small>ASE</small>.—It is with sincere pain we have
witnessed the efforts of certain prints of this
city to prejudice the public mind in regard to the
young man, now confined in the city prison, on a
charge of murder. They have not only gone into
a discussion of the degree of his guilt, but have
indulged themselves in misrepresentations in re-
gard to the history and standing of his family and
connections. Whatever may be thought of Colt's
conduct, it is exceedingly unfair and ungenerous
to involve those who have been placed in the rela-
tion of friends, in the consequences of his mis-
deeds.
   Let us state, then, from undoubted authority, that
the father of the young man is a person of the most
amiable disposition and irreproachable character.
He has been known among his neighbors, as a kind
and honest man, venerable in appearance as he has
been upright in deportment, highly esteemed by all
to whom he is known, and who has reared with
great care, and, as he supposed, with usefulness, a
large and interesting family. The report of his
son's crime is said to have instantly deprived him of
his reason. With one of the brothers of the accused
we are perfectly acquainted, and can testify that he
has always borne among his intimates a high repu-
tation for rectitude and manliness. The notoriety
given to his name, by recent events, is a deep morti-
fication, without being augmented by the unjust
and false criticisms of the press.
   As to Colt himself, the New England Review con-
jectures that he was induced to commit the crime by
strong provocation. It says:
<l9>   “Colt owed Adams about two hundred dollars for
printing; he had performed the work with an un-
derstanding that a consignment should be made of
the first copies of the publication ready for market
to a bookselling establishment in Philadelphia, and
that he (Adams) should receive an advance from
the firm in Philadelphia sufficient to discharge the
obligation. With this understanding between
himself and Colt, he went forward and completed
the work. It was then placed in the binder's hands,
who, by some means became aware of the agree-
ment existing between the other parties. The work
was hurried along and got ready for sale. On the
day before the murder, Colt concluded, very un-
wisely as the event proved, to go to Philadel-
phia himself and superintend the arrange-
ment of affairs there, but whether for the
purpose of defrauding Mr. Adams or not
does not appear, nor would it seem to be easily as-
certained; but as he had not given up his room,
where he was engaged in Book-keeping in New
York, we are inclined to think such was <i>not</i> his in-
tention, and the fact that he gave orders to the bind-
er to have a certain number of copies of the work
boxed and ready for shipment, as <i>he was going to
Philadelphia himself</i>, precludes the idea of a design
to cheat Mr. Adams. But it was sufficient for Mr.
Adams to know that Colt was about to violate his
part of the agreement, in order to discover a fraud
by which he was to suffer, when the binder inform-
ed him that Colt was going to Philadelphia, and
highly exasperated at the idea, and without any time
for consideration as to what would be the most pro-
per course for him to pursue, he hastens to Colt's
office, finds him there, charges him with a design to
wrong him, and in all human probability, used lan-
guage towards him of an exciting and provoking
nature, which led to blows, a scuffle and his death.”</l9>

and dead on a bench, at Hoboken, near the place
where the body of that ill-fated lady was found.
From the evidence adduced before the Coroner's

is said there was no doubt that Payne had com-

   <i>Mary C. Rogers.</i>—Extraordinary as it may appear,
we are informed by the active magistrate at Hobo-
ken, Mr. Gilbert Merritt, that the lifeless body of
Daniel Payne, the supposed lover of the unfortunate
Mary C. Rogers, was found yesterday afternoon near
the spot on the shore where her body was found in
the river. Mr. Merritt had summoned a Coroner's
Jury to set on the body of Payne last evening, at the
Perry Hotel, Hoboken, which he would adjourn to 11
o'clock this morning, to afford an opportunity to
Payne's friends to be present.
   This much we state on Mr. Merritt's authority.
We are further informed, though we cannot vouch
for its accuracy, that when Payne's body was found
life was scarce extinct, and that it bore no marks of
violence—that Payne had been seen at Hoboken
the day before apparently half delirious, and that
about his body, papers were found which will throw
some light on the mysterious death of Mary C. Rogers.
   The public will probably desire to be reminded of
the story told by Payne of his connection with Mary
Rogers, we therefore copy from our files the particu-
lars of his examination, taken at the time:
<l9>   Mr. Daniel Payne voluntarily came to the Police
	<a class="l" href="#Courier-1841-08-12">...</a>
heard, tending to throw any light upon her dreadful
end.</l9>

   On Mr. <a class="l" href="#Courier-1841-08-13">Alfred Crommelin's examination</a> before the
inquest, he stated that Payne was a dissipated man,
and that he had cautioned Mary against marrying
him. That on hearing of Mary being missing, he
called at her mother's and found Payne there, who
immediately left the house, and that on his (Cromme-
lin) expressing his surprise at Payne's sudden depar-
ture, the mother said he had gone to endeavor to dis-
cover what had become of Mary. We find that we
also remarked at that time on the singular fact, that
Payne had not been to see the body of the girl to
whom he was affianced, or taken any pains even to
give her remains a decent burial.

<b>More Mystery—Extraordinary Circumstance
   —Suicide of the Lover of Mary Rogers.</b>
   We learn that Daniel Payne, the lover of Mary
Rogers, was found dead yesterday afternoon, at
Hoboken, near the spot where the body of that un-
fortunate girl was discovered, under circumstances
that warrant the belief that he committed suicide.
The Coroner, Mr. Merritt, summoned a jury of in-
quest immediately, but subsequently adjourned to
this morning, at eleven o'clock, in order to give op-
portunity for the friends of the deceased to be pre-
sent.
   Payne called at the <u>Phenix</u> Hotel, Hoboken, on
Thursday afternoon. His appearance was singular
and attracted much attention. He had no hat on,
and asked a gentleman present to loan him one.—
He eventually obtained a hat, and as he was going
away, he remarked, “Perhaps you don't know who
I am—I am Payne, the lover of Mary Rogers. No
one knows my troubles.” He then left, and no know-
ledge was had of his movements, until he was found
dead yesterday afternoon. Important papers are
said to have been found upon his body, but of their
character we are not informed. Rumor says four
persons are implicated in the murder of the girl.

thus conjoined having had their intention to become man

   S<small>UICIDE OF</small> D<small>ANIEL</small> C. P<small>AYNE</small>.—Yesterday after-
noon <i>Daniel C. Payne</i>, the lover of the murdered
<i>Mary Rogers</i>, was found dead at Hoboken. He had
been staggering about the place all day under the
influence of liquor, as it was thought. There is no
doubt, we understand, of his having committed sui-
cide. An inquest was to be held by <i>Justice Merritt</i>,
of Hoboken, this morning, and if we can obtain the
particulars in time, we shall publish them in this af-
ternoon's paper.
						Two O'clock.
   We have just had a report from the Coroner's Ju-
ry. They had not completed their proceedings, but
it appeared that Payne left his brother's house on
Thursday afternoon, and was wandering about at
Hoboken from that time until his body was found
lifeless yesterday afternoon, at 5 o'clock, near the
Sybil's Cave, where the body of Mary Rogers was
taken from the water.
   This morning the hat of Payne, handkerchief,
spectacle case, and a phial that had contained lau-
danam, were found on the spot where the clothes
supposed to have belonged to Mary Rogers were
found.
   No papers of consequence, or indication concern-
ing the perpetrators of the crime against Mary
Rogers, were found on his person.
   It is manifest that Payne was partially deranged.

<b>The Murder of Mary Rogers—The Inquest on
	Daniel C. Payne, her Lover.</b>
   We stated in the “Herald” of Saturday, that
Daniel C. Payne, the lover of Mary C. Rogers, had
committed suicide at Hoboken, on Friday morning.
This news, which reached the city on Friday night,
occasioned great excitement; and the Mayor and
Justice Taylor crossed the river in a small boat, in
the midst of the storm. They decided that the in-
quest ought to be deferred till yesterday; and then
in the presence of the Mayor the following testimony
was elicited.
<m9>   S<small>AMUEL</small> L. G<small>RISWOLD</small>—I saw the body just before he
died—it was about five o'clock, P. M.—I was going along
the walk with Dr. <u title="Clements (below)">Clement</u>—saw deceased lying on the
bank, head on the bench—loosened his collar and roused
him up, but he died in a few minutes. His hat, an old
straw one, was off. I did not know him. He was pulse-
less and speechless.
   [Here a man came in and said a black hat was found,
which was brought in. It contained a white cambric
handkerchief. Another person brought a broken phial
with a label on it.]
   Griswold's examination resumed—The man groaned,
but we set him on the side-walk where we found him.
I saw he was going to die and thought I would call some
friends who were round the corner. He did not breathe
many times after we saw him.
   [At this point of the examination, it was discovered
that the witness was not sworn.]
   He was then sworn.
   Examination continued—He was dead when I got back.
I am a resident of New York, and a physician.<a id="Herald-1841-10-10-Paynes-breath"></a>
   By the M<small>AYOR</small>—Dr. Clements said that he smelt his
breath, and it smelt sour.
   E<small>DWARD</small> H<small>OPKINS</small> examined—We found the hat up in
the place by the rocks, between the two rocks, where
the young woman is supposed to have been murdered;
higher up than Nick Moore's house. I reside in <u title="Williamsburg (below)">Wil-
liamsburgh</u>, L. I.; I knew the deceased and his brother;
being of the same trade as the deceased, I felt a curiosity
and came over to see about him; we made inquiry where
the place was, and there found the hat and handkerchief;
the neck was off the phial; from all accounts I believe
it to be the same place where Mary Rogers was found; I
left Williamsburg to come to New York to work about 8
o'clock; we made up our minds to come over here, and
thought we would go out of curiosity and see the place;
I have never seen deceased since the death of Mary Ro-
gers; left New York about 9 o'clock this morning, and
had to wait a little while before the boat came in.
   J<small>OHN</small> P<small>AYNE</small> examined—I am the brother of the deceas-
ed; that is his hat; he bought it at the corner of Mulber-
ry street; I cannot speak to the handkerchief; he wore
a crape band on his hat since the death of Miss Rogers;
it was put on by Mrs. Payne.
   [A pocket book was here produced by the coroner, and
that with some papers recognised by witness.]
   By the M<small>AYOR</small>—That pair of spectacles is my brother's;
last saw my brother on Thursday; he was very <u title="dejected">dejocted</u>
and appeared as if he had been drinking; he had board-
ed for some time in John street, but for the last week in
Ann street; he did not say where he was going; I asked
about the scratch on his nose, but he said he did not
know.
   By the Coroner.—I should say he <u title="had been out">had out</u> of his mind
since the affair of Mary Rogers. He <u title="was not (Herald-1841-10-11)">was</u> habitually a
drinking man. He appeared to be much attached to Miss
Rogers.
   James <u title="Lowerre (elsewhere)">Lawrence</u> ex'd.—I am a cork cutter. Work at
194 Water street. Was present when most of the things
were found. We stopped at Mr. Payne's <u title="brother">brather</u>'s and
found the door closed. When we stood on the corner of
Beekman street it was past 8 o'clock. We went to Nick
Moore's house, and there enquired for the place where
Mary Rogers was murdered, and when we got to the
two roads I saw the hat between a cleft in the rock, and
I found the phial. We then went to Ludlow's, thinking
the Jury would be there, and from there to Nick Moore's
and enquired for the Coroner. Just above here we met
two gentlemen who wanted<u title=" us "> </u>to give up the hat or go back
with them.
   By the M<small>AYOR</small>—We met a sort of a loafer before we
found the hat, but he did not give us any thing.
   Mrs. Loss examined—I think I saw the person of de-
ceased once in New York and once out here last fall
gunning. He did not at all correspond with the person
I saw with Mary Rogers in July last. I have been from
home for two or three days, and cannot say if the deceas-
ed had been at my house.
   <u title="James McShane, McShean (elsewhere)">A<small>ARON</small> McK<small>ANE</small></u> examined—I saw the deceased on
Friday, about 5 or 6 o'clock, A. M. A man came to me
in the evening, and told me that a man was dying in the
street. I went to him and asked him if he was a French-
man—he said “no, he was of any country.” We took
him on a stoop hard by, and he said he wanted a glass of
water, Scudder would not give it to him; said he had
been drinking, and would give no satisfaction as to who
he was; I told him he would not live five minutes.
   By the Mayor—This was in the village of Hoboken,
a mile and a half from the place where the hat was found,
and it may be half a mile from the place where the body
was found. When he was first found, his head was lying
down in a hollow, and I said, my dear man, if you don't
get shelter, you'll not live fifteen minutes. A Mr. Borly
said he saw a man near the place where Mary Rogers
was found, and he said to me that the man who killed
Mary Rogers ought to be hung up. The man had some
writing in his hand, which appeared to have been done
some time.
   S<small>AMUEL</small> W<small>HITNEY</small> examined—Was present when de-
ceased came into the <u title="Phoenix">Phœnix</u> Hotel on Thursday night.
He had no hat on, and we gave him one. He seemed
very weak, and could hardly stand up. He was more
like a man sleepy than in liquor.
   W<small>ARREN</small> S<small>MITH</small>—I live at the Phœnix Hotel—the de-
ceased came to the house just before 10. He was bare-
headed—we gave him a hat. He had a glass or tumbler
half full of brandy, for which he paid a shilling. He
looked red and a little intoxicated—had no talk with him,
but he said, “Suppose you know me?” “No sir.” “Well,
I'm the man who was to have been married to Mary
Rogers—I'm a man of a good deal of trouble.” He did
not ask for lodging, but requested the way to Vauxhall
Gardens. He took the brandy when he first came in.—
He had lost his hat about half a mile off. He mentioned
no names but that of Mary Rogers.
   W<small>HITNEY</small> recalled.—When Payne came in, he did not
appear to have money. He enquired if there was any
other way to get to New York beside the ferry.
   J<small>OHN</small> <u title="Wood (elsewhere)">W<small>OODS</small></u> examined—I saw the deceased yesterday
about 9 o'clock A. M., was lying on the ground, <u title="apparently">appar-
ly</u> asleep. It was about 100 yards from the second bench
on the walk. There were a number of persons fishing
on Friday, but they were all strangers to me. The place
where I saw deceased lying, was just in front of the
Mansion House. I did not attempt to arouse him.
   C<small>ROMMELIN</small> examined—The body found is that of Dan-
iel Payne. I last saw him two or three days ago.
   W<small>ILLIAM</small> <u title="Latourette (elsewhere)">L<small>ATTARETT</small></u> examined—Saw Daniel Payne
about a quarter past 4 Friday, lying in the stink weeds;
I was going to fetch a doctor, and he lay on his back
snoring and making a dreadful noise; it was near day-
light; another man picked him up, and put him on <u title="Riarty, Ruddy (elsewhere)">Riet-
ty</u>'s stoop, and from thence to Scudder's, and asked for a
drink of water; Scudder said he ought to go where he
got drunk, but he gave him a drink of water, and the de-
ceased stood about half an hour; he then got as far as the
ice house, and he stood there for three quarters of an
hour; then I did not see him again till the afternoon,
when he sat on a bench by the walk, and I made the re-
mark, “there's the man I saw this morning.”
   S<small>AMUEL</small> G<small>RISWOLD</small> examined—I have been present du-
ring the post mortem examination of the deceased; the
stomach, heart, and lungs appear healthy; the last food
appears to be potatoes; the brain is much congested, but
whether from laudanum or alcohol, or from the position
in which he was found, I cannot tell; cannot find any
trace of poison or <u title="extravasation">extravation</u> of blood, to show he died
from <u title="apoplexy">appoplexy</u>; cannot say from the phial now produc-
ed, that is has contained laudanum, though it is so label-
led; with respect to the cause of death, I should say that
any one who had been drinking and put in that position,
would die.<a id="Herald-1841-10-10-Dr-Cook"></a>
   Dr. C<small>OOK</small> examined—Myself and the last witness exa-
mined the deceased, and we agree in all important points.
In the stomach I could detect no trace of poison. The
lungs were healthy, but the heart somewhat wasted.—
The liver was merely congested in the veins of the dura
mater, which might be produced from fracture, falling
from a bench. His manner of living for the two or three
days, would be likely to induce <u title="congestion">conjestion</u>. I could smell
alcohol in the brain but not laudanum. Alcohol would
perpetuate the smell of laudanum. My opinion, as a me-
dical man, is that he has probably fallen in a state of stu-
pefaction, and that peculiar position has been the cause
of his death.
   <u title="Ossian (elsewhere)">O. W. C.</u> Loss, a boy 12 years old, examined.—I think I
saw the man dead come into the bar and get a glass of
brandy. He asked if I could not trust. I said no; he
then asked if I knew where Mary Rogers was murdered;
I said yes, and asked if I should show him. He said no,
and went away; I do not know which day it was, either
Thursday or Friday; <u title="That man (Herald-1841-10-11)">Ae</u> appeared intoxicated, and went
down the lower road.
   W<small>ILLIAM</small> <u title="Busby (elsewhere)">M<small>USBY</small></u>, examined—I think I saw deceased on
Thursday afternoon, about 5 or 6 PM; it was on this side
of Weehawken Hill. It was the place where Mary Ro-
gers was said to be murdered, that he was sitting with a
pocket book in his hand, and appeared to be writing. A
Mr. Wilson who was with me, said, as we passed, “that
the murderer of Mary Rogers ought to be brought and
hung on this spot.” The deceased might have heard but
made no remark.
   Charles <u>Rietty</u> examined.—I have not seen the deceas-
ed since Friday morning. He was seated on the scuttle
of my house. Scudder called me; and I saw him give
the man a glass of water, and tell him he must go away.
   The Jury were locked up for about half an hour, and
then found the following verdict:—“That the said Daniel
C. Payne was found dead, with congestion of the brain,
supposed to be brought about by exposure and irregu-
larity of living, incident to aberration of mind.”</m9>

P<small>AYNE, THE LATE LOVER AND BETROTHED HUSBAND OF</small> M<small>A-
RY</small> C. R<small>OGERS</small>.—On Friday night and Saturday morning
Gilbert Merritt, Esq. acting as coroner of Hudson county,
held an inquest at Perry's Hotel, Hoboken, New Jersey,
on the body of Daniel C. Payne, a native of England, late
cork cutter of this city, who was found on Friday after-
noon about 5 o'clock lying on a bench by the side of the
walk near the Sybil's Cave, Hoboken, in a dying state,
and shortly after expired. The deceased acquired con-
siderable notoriety, soon after the death of Mary C. Ro-
gers, to whom he was engaged to be married, and whose
admirer and wooer he had been for months, having board-
ed with her mother at No. 126 Nassau street, up to the
time of her mysterious disappearance and untimely
and cruel death. Payne after her death, was by
some suspected of being privy to her abduction, or as
knowing where she was and with whom she went away,
and brought to the Police Office and interrogated closely
on this subject, but he being able to account satisfactorily
for every hour of his time on the Sunday of her disap-
pearance, was discharged from even suspicion by the
magistrates. After her lifeless body was found, and her
melancholy fate made manifest, Payne's feelings evident-
ly became too overwhelmed for his mind to endure, and
his sorrow and disappointed hope shook reason from her
throne, and he might be considered from that period as
lost to himself and to society. His business energies re-
laxed, his habits of indulgence in drink increased, and
on Thursday he left the city and wandered about the
woods and amongst the rocks and thickets of Hoboken,
exposed to cold, hunger, thirst and his own tormenting
feelings until nature became exhausted and he sunk into
the embraces of death, near the unhallowed spot where
his affianced bride had, (as supposed,) been brutally
outraged and murdered. He too was <i>indirectly</i> murder-
ed by the same hand that destroyed his intended wife, and
his blood rests on the head of her destroyer. From the
evidence adduced before the Coroner's Jury it appeared
that Payne had not committed suicide as was at first re-
ported, but had fallen a victim to his own melancholy and
insane wanderings while brooding over the memory of her
he loved. The first witness who testified before the Cor-
oner's Jury was
   <i>Dr. Samuel L. Griswold</i> of this city, who was walking
along toward the Cave on Friday afternoon about five
o'clock, with Dr. Clements; saw the deceased lying on a
bench, his knees and head down; witness raised him up,
loosened his collar, and he soon after died. His eyes
were partially open.
   <i>Edward Hopkins</i> deposed that he found the hat of a
man near the place where Miss Rogers was supposed to
have been murdered, and the phial that had contained lau-
danum near it—the hat between the weeds and the phial
near it. It was marked laudanum, Souillard & Delluc,
late Place, 2 Park Row. A little further witness found a
white pocket handkerchief.
   <i>John Payne</i>, brother of deceased, deposed to the hat as
being his brother's—the crape was put on soon after Miss
Roger's death. He identified also a pocket-book, specta-
cles, &c. found on the body. The last time witness saw
his brother, was on Thursday after dinner; he appeared
to have drank some. He was much dejected, and had
been so ever since Miss Roger's death. Witness thought
that his brother had not been of sane mind since the death
of Miss Rogers, to whom he was much attached.
   <i>James <u title="Lowerre (elsewhere)">Lawrence</u></i> testified as to having been with Hop-
kins when the hat, phial, &c. were found near the spot
where Miss Rogers was supposed to have been murdered.
   <i>Mrs. Loss</i> deposed to having seen the deceased once in
N. York, and once last fall gunning. He did not corres-
pond in appearance with the person she saw with Miss
Rogers in July last. That person was younger, thinner,
and not so tall.
   <u title="McShean, Aaron McKane (elsewhere)"><i>James McShane</i></u> saw the deceased on Friday morning,
6 o'clock; one of his men told him there was a man lying
in the thick woods near the village, about 100 yards from
witnesses house; went to him, touched him in the foot,
and asked him if he were a Frenchman or American—he
said no, but requested a drink of water; picked him up,
carried him to <u title="Rietty, Ruddy (elsewhere)">Riarty</u>'s tavern, and set him down on the
stoop; he then got up and went to Scudder's tavern, but
was refused admittance, and gave him no water, because
they thought something besides drink was the matter
with him. This was in the village of Hoboken 1½ miles
from where the body was found.
   <i>Samuel Whitney</i> deposed he was in the Phoenix Hotel
when the deceased came there about 10 o'clock without
a hat; he asked for and they gave him an old straw hat;
he could scarcely stand; his eyes looked sleepy, not as if
he were in liquor.
   <i>Warren Smith</i> saw the deceased at 10 o'clock on Thurs-
day night, he wanted liquor and drank a tumbler half
full of brandy; he said, “I suppose you <u>dont</u> know me;”
witness answered no; he then said “I'm the man that
was promised to Mary Rogers,” and as he went out, he
said “I am a man of great deal of trouble;<u title="” "> </u>he said he
lost his hat half a mile off, and wished to be shown
the way to Vauxhall Gardens, and went towards them.
The woods he was found lying in the next morning were
near this house.
   <i>John <u title="Woods (elsewhere)">Wood</u></i> deposed that he saw the deceased lying on
the ground on the walk, in front of the Mansion House,
about 9 o'clock on Friday morning. He appeared to be
asleep and witness did not disturb him.
   <i>Mr. Crommelin</i> then entered the room, identified the
body, and said he saw deceased about three Sundays ago
—there was no coolness between them.
   <i>William Latourette</i> saw the deceased about a quarter
past 4 o'clock on Friday morning, lying in the weeds. He
laid on his back, snoring and made a dreadful noise. Ano-
ther man picked him up and put him on a stoop. He
then went to Scudder's, got a drink of water, went to near
the ice-house, and stood there near an hour. Witness
saw him again in the afternoon, sitting on a bench by the
walk.
   <i><u title="O. W. C. (elsewhere)">Ossian</u> Loss</i>, a boy, saw the deceased at his mother's
house on either Thursday or Friday, he could not say
which. He came in and asked for a glass of brandy and
water, which he took. He asked where Mary Rogers was
murdered; witness told him, and he went in the direction
of the place, staggering as he went.
   <i>William Busby</i> saw the deceased on <u title="Thursday">Tursdsay</u> afternoon
at 5 o'clock on Weehawken hill, sitting on the spot where
Mary Rogers said to have been murdered. He had a
pocket book on his knees, writing, and took no notice of
witness or his companion.
   <i>Dr. Griswold</i> executed a post mortem examination,
and found the stomach, heart and lungs healthy—the
brain much congested, but whether from brandy, lauda-
num or the position in which he was found, witness could
not tell; could not find any trace of poison or extravasa-
tion of blood, to show that he died of apoplexy; thought
the drink he had taken and the position he was found in
caused his death.
   <i>Dr. Cook</i> generally concurred with Dr. Griswold—
found no smell or indication of laudanum at the stomach;
his heart however was wasted, which might account for his
melancholy. Witness thought he detected the presence
of laudanum on the brain—that his manner of passing
the previous twenty-four hours of his life must have tend-
ed to his death, and that he might have fallen from the
bench, which, with his peculiar position, was the probable
cause of death.
   Amongst the papers found was one in pencil, in these
words:<a id="Tribune-1841-10-11-Payne-to-the-world"></a>
			“T<SMALL>O THE WORLD</SMALL>.
   H<small>ERE</small> I <small>AM ON THE SPOT</small>. <i>God forgive me for my mis-
fortune<u title=" in (elsewhere)">, or for</u> my misspent time</i>.”
   There was nothing to implicate him in the remotest de-
gree in the affair of the murder of Miss Rogers.
   The jury found the following verdict: “Found dead
with congestion of the brain, supposed to be brought
about by exposure and irregularity of living, incident to
aberration of mind.”

================================================================
<d>[Col.2]</d>
		<m8>Reported for the Courier & Enquirer.</m8>
   <i>Inquest on Daniel C. Payne at Hoboken.</i>—Samuel <u title="L. (elsewhere)">S.</u>
Griswold, Physician, of N. York, testified that he was
walking along the bank of the North river, at Ho-
boken, in company with a friend, near the Sybil's
Cave, on Friday the 8th inst., about 5 o'clock P. M.
and he discovered a man lying with his feet upon a
bench, knees bended, and his body and head back
upon the ground, giving him the appearance of having
fallen backwards. He was not dead, but in the last
stage of existence—his breathing was prolonged, and
he gave very little indication of violent or acute pain.
He expired in two or three minutes. Did not see
him expire. He had friends at a very short distance,
but out of sight; he went after them, and when he
returned the man was dead; raised him and sustain-
ed him in an upright position; he saw no marks of
external violence; there was a slight scratch on his
nose.
   [During the above examination, a man entered,
bringing a black hat with a crape around it, a dirty
white handkerchief, the neck and body of a vial,
broken, and a spectacle case.]
   This man's name was Edward Hopkins, cork cut-
ter; he worked for J. D. Sparkman <s>139</s> Water street,
New York, said he saw in a newspaper early in the
morning an account of the death of Payne, and that
an inquest was to be held at 11 o'clock, so he pro-
posed to a fellow workman to go over to Hoboken
and attend the inquest. He arrived at Hoboken
very early, and being unable to hear exactly where
the inquest was to be, they proceeded to visit the spot
where Mary C. Rogers was murdered. (Here they
gave minute details of the enquiries which they made
to find the way, and which it is unnecessary to give.)
They discovered the place, where they found the
above mentioned articles. The hat they first found
and <u>laying</u> near was the neck of the vial, and at a
short distance they found the other part, a short dis-
tance from this was the spectacle case; the hat was
found between the fragments of a rock.
   They then returned to attend the inquest.
   James <u title="Lawrence (elsewhere)">Lowerre</u>, cork cutter, accompanied Hopkins
and confirmed his testimony.
   Mrs. Loss, at whose house, at Weehawken, Mary
C. Rogers was last seen on the 25th July, said that
she thought she had seen deceased in New York,
and once last fall while he was gunning. There was
no resemblance between him and the man who ac-
companied Mary Rogers.
   John Payne, brother of deceased—Recognized the
body; said he saw him last on Thursday soon after
dinner; he appeared greatly dejected; he asked him
how the scratch on his nose happened, deceased re-
plied that he did not know; he had not appeared in
his right mind since the death of Miss Rogers; he
was not intemperate; the hat he recognized as that
of his brother, he purchased it in Chatham street cor-
ner of Mulberry; the handkerchief he did not know;
the spectacle case he said was his brother's; a pock-
et book was produced which he also knew, and in it
some little memoranda, which he said was in his bro-
ther's hand-writing; the spectacles also he said belong-
ed to his brother; he wore crape around his hat in con-
sequence of the death of Miss Rogers, to whom he
was engaged to be married. Here some witnesses
testified to having seen him on Friday morning lying
on the grass in an apparently intoxicated or enfeebled
condition, and that they gave him some water; this
was about half a mile from where he was found dy-
ing.
<d>[Col.3]</d>
   Saml. <u title="Whitney (elsewhere)">Smith</u> and Warren Smith said that he came
to the <u>Phenix</u> Hotel about 10 o'clock on Thursday
night—was bareheaded—he got some brandy and
paid for it—looked red and intoxicated. Told who
he was—said he was engaged to Miss Rogers, and
spoke of his troubles. They furnished him with an
old straw hat—enquired the way to Vauxhall Gar-
den—said he had no money, and wanted to know if
there was no other way of getting to New York than
by the Hoboken ferry.
   John <u title="Woods (elsewhere)">Wood</u> saw him lying on the grass on Friday
about 9 o'clock, 3 or 400 yards from where he died.
   Mr. Latourette saw him <u>laying</u> on the ground about
half-past 4 o'clock where the other witnesses saw
him. After that he saw him on Mr. Scudder's stoop
—about 3 P. M. saw him near where he died.
   Dr. Griswold examined—Attended the post mor-
tem examination. The stomach, heart and lungs ap-
peared in a healthy state. The brain was much con-
gested—and it might be from alcohol, laudanum, or
the peculiar position in which he was found dying,
could not tell which. No trace of poison or extrava-
sation of blood to show that he died from <u title="apoplexy">appoplexy</u>.
Any one who had been in that position after drinking
he should think would die.
   Dr. Cook agreed in the material points with Dr.
Griswold.—Could not discover the influence of lauda-
num—could detect no poison in the stomach—the
heart was somewhat wasted, the liver was congested
in he veins of the dura mater, and might be produced
by a fracture, such as falling from a bench. In the
brain could smell alcohol, but not laudanum. As a
medical man he gave his opinion that the immediate
cause of death was falling in his enfeebled state and re-
maining in such a position as to produce <u title="congestion">conjestion</u>
of the brain.
   Wm. <s title="Busby (elsewhere)">Buxby</s> examined—Was in company with a
Mr. Wilson, thinks they saw deceased between 5 and
6 o'clock P. M. at the place where Mary C. Rogers
was said to have been murdered. He was sitting
with a pocket-book in his hand and apparently writ-
ing. Mr. Wilson said as they passed him, that “the
murderer of Mary Rogers ought to be hung on this
spot.” Deceased was near enough to hear, but paid
no attention, not even looking up.
   The jury found a verdict—that “the said Daniel C.
Payne was found dead with congestion of the brain,
supposed to be brought about by exposure, and irregu-
larity of living, incident to <u title="aberration">aberation</u> of mind.
   Payne was 32 years of age.

   D<small>EATH OF</small> D<small>ANIEL</small> C. P<small>AYNE, THE BETROTHED</small>
H<small>USBAND OF</small> M<small>ISS</small> R<small>OGERS</small>.—Our readers are
aware of the recent existence of a man named
Daniel <u title="C.">L.</u> Payne, a native of England, and a cork
cutter of this city, whose name was first present-
ed to the public <i>generally</i>, immediately after the
discovery of the murdered body of the beautiful
and unfortunate Mary C. Rogers. It then became
a matter of notoriety that Payne, who had been
for a considerable time a boarder in the house of
Mrs. Rogers, 126 Nassau street, was the accepted
lover and betrothed husband of the lovely girl in
her life time, and whom he would soon have led
to the hymeneal altar, had not the brutal and
bloody hands of the violator and murderer—sev-
ered forever their earthly destinies by death.—
Payne, although an industrious, was a somewhat
intemperate man, during the lifetime of his inten-
ded bride, and appeared to be deficient in those
refined feelings, nice sensibilities, and polite at-
tentions calculated to win and to retain the ardent
heart of a young and lovely lady. Still her affec-
tions had yielded to the solicitations of her lover,
who appeared devotedly attached to the object of
his attentions.
   After the disappearance of Miss Rogers, and the
mystery that enshrouded her fate, Payne, who at
first exhibited an extraordinary apathy concerning
her, soon after became alarmingly alive to her
safety, and sought her in every direction; but with
a want of tact and judgment that evinced an im-
becility of mind or a partially disordered intellect
apparently the result of silent sorrow for her
loss. When the disfigured and rapidly decompo-
sing body of the once beautiful girl was found,
all bloated and loathsome, floating in the waters
of the Hudson, near the far famed Sybil's cave,
with the damning evidences of the spoiler's hand
upon it, Payne's mind, which before had been
shaken by the shock, sunk under the oppression
of his feelings and the blighting of his hopes—and
not possessing a sufficiency of philosophy to bear
up against the bitter disappointment that had bu-
ried in an untimely grave all his anticipations of
matrimonial bliss, he yielded to the tempter,
drink—indulged in repeated excesses, as a salve
for his lacerated feelings, neglected his business,
contracted a disrelish for society, and finally be-
came a derelict from the moral duties and obliga-
tions of manhood—and, broken in mind, and crush-
ed in spirit, abandoned himself to a melancholy
destiny.
   In this state of warfare with his own hopes and
prospects, and with the sociabilities of life, he
strayed from his boarding house, at No. 4 Ann st.,
on Thursday morning last, and bent his brooding
way to the solitudes of the groves, and the nearly
deserted haunts of the recently gay scenes of
Hoboken. There, he could meditate on the me-
mory of her whom he had loved, and there indulge
a grief that was rapidly wasting his heart. Amidst
those woods and wilds he wandered on Thursday
and Friday as a voluntary outcast from society,
sitting and brooding over the unhappy fate of his
affianced bride, bewailing her melancholy death
among the rocks and caverns, lingering with a
mournful satisfaction near her late watery bed—
or seeking the tangled brake where her blood had
crimsoned the soil, and her honor and her life had
been torn from her possession by the ruthless de-
stroyer's hand. Or as an unhappy episode to his
painful reflections, he rushed into the temples of
intemperance, quaffed the intoxicating cup, drove
reason completely from its throne, and then to com-
plete the ruin, lodged upon the damp earth, recli-
ned upon the humid sod, abstained from food and
nourishment, and extending himself upon a bench
near the Sybil's cave, died by his own neglect and
tortured feelings, the second victim of a murder-
ous bond.
   From the evidence adduced at the Coroner's
Jury, summoned before Justice Gilbert Merritt, of
Hudson county, it appeared that Payne, after go-
ing to Hoboken, roved about from that place to
Weehawken, visited the house of Mrs. Loss, at
the latter place, where Miss Rogers had last been
seen with a young man who left there with her
on the 25th of July—enquired of a boy the spot on
which she was murdered—indulged in drink—lost
his hat—engaged in reading scraps of manuscript
—spoke of his troubles—told of his engagement to
Miss Rogers—laid down in the woods, or reclined
under grape vines—suffered from hunger, thirst,
cold and constant exposures, with no house to
shelter—no bed to repose on—no hand to relieve
him—and finally died without a friend to close his
eyes. The testimony taken in brief is as fol-
lows:
<l9>   Dr. Samuel L. Griswold deposed that he found
the deceased about 5 o'clock on Friday afternoon
lying on one of the benches, his knees down and
his head also. Raised him up, loosened his collar,
and he died almost instantly. His eyes were but
partially open.
   Edward Hopkins deposed that he found the hat,
and phial that had contained laudanum, near the
spot where Mary Rogers was supposed to have
been murdered, above Nick Moore's house. The
hat was between the rocks, the phial a little way
from it.
   John Payne, brother of the deceased, identified
the hat found as that of his brother. The crape
on it was put on at the time of the death of Miss
Rogers, to whom he was much attached; also iden-
tified a pocketbook, spectacles, &c., found on the
body. The last time witness saw his brother was
on Thursday; after dinner he appeared to have
drank wine. He was much dejected, and had
been so since Miss Rogers' death. Saw a scratch
on his nose—and asked him how it came—he said
he did not know. Witness thought deceased had
not been of sane mind since the death of Miss Ro-
gers.
   James <u title="Lawrence (elsewhere)">Lowerre</u> deposed that he found the hat
and other things of deceased, except the phial.
Mrs. Loss deposed that she had seen the deceased,
and that his appearance did not correspond with
that of the person whom she saw at her house
with Miss Rogers on the Sunday she was mur-
dered. <u title="McShane, Aaron McKane (elsewhere)">James McShean</u>, stated that he was in-
formed on Friday morning by one of his men, that
a man was lying in the <s title="woods ?">weeds</s> near the village,
dying. Asked him several questions, what coun-
tryman he was, &c., but he did not reply distinct-
ly, but asked for a glass of water. The place
where he was, was a mile and a half from Mrs.
Loss's. Saw him get up and go to the house of a
man named Scudder, who refused him admittance,
and gave him no water. Witness supposed him
to be drunk. Samuel Whitney saw deceased
about 10 o'clock on Thursday night at the <u>Phenix</u>
Hotel without a hat; and an old straw hat was
given him; he appeared to be stupid, and could
scarcely stand. Warren Smith said the deceased
was at his house a little before 10 on Thursday
night—had a glass of brandy—a tumbler half full
—appeared to be drunk. He said he was the
man who was to have been married to Mary Ro-
gers, and that he was in a great deal of trouble.
Said he had lost his hat about half a mile above
—appeared to talk natural, and wished to be
shown the way to Vauxhall Garden. He wished
to know if the last boat had left for New York.
He had no money.
   John <u title="Wood (elsewhere)">Woods</u> saw deceased lying on the ground
in front of the Mansion House, at 9 o'clock on Fri-
day morning; thought he was drunk; did not dis-
turb him. William Latourette saw deceased about
9 o'clock of Friday, lying on his back in some
weeds, moaning. He was taken up and walked
to Mr. Scudder's, where he asked for a drink of
water, which was given him. He then sat down
on the stoop, appeared to be drunk, got up and
pitched against the fence. Witness saw him again
about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, <u title="sitting">setting</u> on a bench.
<u title="O. W. C. (elsewhere)">Ossian</u> Loss, a boy, saw deceased on Thursday or
Friday at the home of Mrs. Loss, his mother, at
Weehawken, where he got something to drink.
He inquired of the boy if he knew where Mary
Rogers was murdered. Witness told him, and he
went in that direction. He then had on a black
hat and staggered when he left. William Busby
saw deceased on Thursday afternoon between 5
and 6 o'clock, on the side of Weehawken hill, un-
der a grape vine, sitting with a (written on) paper
in his hand.
   Charles <u title="Rietty, Riarty (elsewhere)">Ruddy</u> saw deceased on Friday morn-
ing, sitting on Scudder's stoop, who gave him a
glass of water. Left there and went the opposite
side of the road, and held on the fence. Witness
supposed him to be crazy. [An ounce phial that
contained laudanum, was found in his pocket,
marked <u title="Souillard & Delluc (elsewhere; seems Delluc took late Place's place)">Place & Souillard</u>.
   The coroner stated that the papers found on the
deceased would in no way implicate him, as being
concerned in the murder of Miss Rogers, and that
as they were not important, it was not necessary
to lay them before the public.]</l9>
<d id="Sun-1841-10-11-Col4">[Col.4]</d>
<l9>   Dr. Griswold made a post-mortem examination
of the body, and deposed that he found the stom-
ach, heart, lungs, &c. healthy. Examined the
brain, and found it congested; found no symptoms
of poison in the stomach; thought there was not
sufficient evidence that he died of apoplexy; thinks
that the fact of any person found in his situation
—with his head down—after hard drinking, would
cause death. Dr. Cook also assisted at the post-
mortem examination; agreed in the opinions ad-
vanced by Dr. Griswold; he said that the stomach
was taken out, and its contents would be subjected
to a chemical analysis; witness could not trace the
immediate cause of death, though he thought he
could smell alcohol in the brain; thought deceased
had not taken any laudanum, and opined that if
he had fallen from the bench in a state of stupor,
it would be sufficient to cause death. The coro-
ner's jury then rendered a verdict of “found dead
with congestion of the brain, supposed to be
brought about by exposure and irregularity of liv-
ing, incident to aberration of mind.”
   Thus perished the lover and betrothed husband
of the murdered Mary C. Rogers, the victim of
feelings caused by her melancholy death.
   Amongst the papers found on his person were
the following lines, written in pencil:<a id="Sun-1841-10-11-Payne-to-the-world"></a>
   “<i>To the World:—Here I am on the spot; God
forgive me for my misfortune<u title=", or for (elsewhere)"> in</u> my misspent time.</i>”
   It is to be remembered, also, that in addition to
the loss Payne had sustained by the death of
Miss Rogers, he was also suspected by some as
the murderer, and was taken to the police and in-
terrogated touching his last interviews with her,
and the occupation of his time on the Sabbath of
her death. All this he satisfactorily accounted
for, and was by the police magistrates exonerated
from all suspicion. Still he was suspected by
some in words audible to his ear, which suspicion
drove the dagger still deeper into his soul, and
aided in the overthrow of his tottering mind in
his melancholy death. It is strange, however,
that those who saw him a wanderer about the
woods and walks of Hoboken, hatless, haggard,
and without money, food or lodgings, should not
have endeavored to relieve and rescue him from
death, rather than to gaze with idle curiosity up-
on his bewildered movements, and the ebbings
of a life a burthen to its possessor. But such is
the world, inhuman and unfeeling, when misery
crosses its path. Peace to the ashes of Payne,
and may his death and that of his beloved Miss
Rogers carry a pang to the bosoms of the mur-
derers, and compel them to confess their guilt.</l9>

<b>The Murder of Mary Rogers—The Inquest on
	Daniel C. Payne, her Lover.</b>
   We stated in the “Herald” of Saturday, that
Daniel C. Payne, the lover of Mary C. Rogers, had
committed suicide at Hoboken, on Friday morning.
This news, which reached the city on Friday night,
occasioned great excitement; and the Mayor and
Justice Taylor crossed the river in a small boat, in
the midst of the storm. They decided that the in-
quest ought to be deferred till <u title="(BEFORE yesterday)">yesterday</u>; and then
in the presence of the Mayor the following testimony
was elicited.
<m9>   S<small>AMUEL</small> L. G<small>RISWOLD</small>—I saw the body just before he
died—it was about five o'clock, P. M.—I was going along
the walk with Dr. <u title="Clements (below)">Clement</u>—saw deceased lying on the
bank, head on the bench—loosened his collar and roused
him up, but he died in a few minutes. His hat, an old
straw one, was off. I did not know him. He was pulse-
less and speechless.
   [Here a man came in and said a black hat was found,
which was brought in. It contained a white cambric
handkerchief. Another person<u> also</u> brought a broken
phial with a label on it<u> “laudanum.”</u>]
   Griswold's examination resumed—The man groaned,
but we set him on the side-walk where we found him.
I saw he was going to die and thought I would call some
friends who were round the corner. He did not breathe
many times after we saw him.
   [At this point of the examination, it was discovered
that the witness was not sworn.]
   He was then sworn.
   Examination continued—He was dead when I got back.
I am a resident of New York, and a physician.
   By the M<small>AYOR</small>—Dr. Clements said that he smelt his
breath, and it smelt sour.
   E<small>DWARD</small> H<small>OPKINS</small> examined—We found the hat up in
the place by the rocks, between the two rocks, where
the young woman is supposed to have been murdered;
higher up than Nick Moore's house. I reside in <u title="Williamsburg (below)">Wil-
liamsburgh</u>, L. I.; I knew the deceased and his brother;
being of the same trade as the deceased, I felt a curiosity
and came over to see about him; we made inquiry where
the place was, and there found the hat and handkerchief;
the neck was off the phial; from all accounts I believe
it to be the same place where Mary Rogers was found; I
left Williamsburg to come to New York to work about 8
o'clock; we made up our minds to come over here, and
thought we would go out of curiosity and see the place;
I have never seen deceased since the death of Mary Ro-
gers;<u> we</u> left New York about 9 o'clock this morning,
and had to wait a little while before the boat came in.
   J<small>OHN</small> P<small>AYNE</small> examined—I am the brother of the deceas-
ed; that is his hat; he bought it at the corner of Mulber-
ry street; I cannot speak to the handkerchief; he wore
a crape band on his hat since the death of Miss Rogers;
it was put on by Mrs. Payne.
   [A pocket book was here produced by the coroner, and
that with some papers recognised by witness.]
   By the M<small>AYOR</small>—That pair of spectacles is my brother's;
last saw my brother on Thursday; he was very <u>dejected</u>
and appeared as if he had been drinking; he had board-
ed for some time in John street, but for the last week in
Ann street; he did not say where he was going; I asked
about the scratch on his nose, but he said he did not
know<u> how he got it</u>.
   By the Coroner.—I should say he had<u> been</u> out of his
mind since the affair of Mary Rogers. He was<u> not</u> ha-
bitually a drinking man. He appeared to be much attach-
ed to Miss Rogers.
   James <u title="Lowerre (elsewhere)">Lawrence</u> ex'd.—I am a cork cutter. Work at
194 Water street. Was present when most of the things
were found. We stopped at Mr. Payne's <u>brother</u>'s and
found the door closed. <u>As</u> we stood on the corner of
Beekman street it was past 8 o'clock. We went to Nick
Moore's house, and there enquired for the place where
Mary Rogers was murdered, and when we got to the
two roads I saw the hat between a cleft in the rock, and
I found the phial. We then went to Ludlow's, thinking
the Jury would be there, and from there to Nick Moore's
and enquired for the Coroner. Just above here we met
two gentlemen who wanted<u> us</u> to give up the hat or go
back with them.
   By the M<small>AYOR</small>—We met a sort of a loafer before we
found the hat, but he did not give us any thing.
   Mrs. Loss examined—I think I saw the person of de-
ceased once in New York and once out here last fall
gunning. He did not at all correspond with the person
I saw with Mary Rogers in July last. I have been from
home for two or three days, and cannot say if the deceas-
ed had been at my house.
   <u title="James McShane (elsewhere)">A<small>ARON</small> McK<small>ANE</small></u> examined—I saw the deceased on
Friday, about 5 or 6 o'clock, A. M. A man came to me
in the evening, and told me that a man was dying in the
street. I went to him and asked him if he was a French-
man—he said “no, he was of any country.” We took
him on a stoop hard by, and he said he wanted a glass of
water, Scudder would not give it to him; said he had
been drinking, and would give no satisfaction as to who
he was; I told him he would not live five minutes.
   By the Mayor—This was in the village of Hoboken,
a mile and a half from the place where the hat was found,
and it may be half a mile from the place where the body
was found. When he was first found, his head was lying
down in a hollow, and I said, my dear man, if you don't
get shelter, you'll not live fifteen minutes. A Mr. Borly
said he saw a man near the place where Mary Rogers
was found, and he said to me that the man who killed
Mary Rogers ought to be hung up<u> there</u>. The man<u> we
saw</u> had some writing in his hand, which appeared to
have been done some time.
   S<small>AMUEL</small> W<small>HITNEY</small> examined—Was present when de-
ceased came into the <u title="Phoenix">Phœnix</u> Hotel on Thursday night.
He had no hat on, and we gave him one. He seemed
very weak, and could hardly stand up. He was more
like a man sleepy than in liquor.
   W<small>ARREN</small> S<small>MITH</small>—I live at the Phœnix Hotel—the de-
ceased came to the house just before 10. He was bare-
headed—we gave him a hat. He had a glass or tumbler
half full of brandy, for which he paid a shilling. He
looked red and a little intoxicated—had no talk with him,
but he said, “Suppose you know me?” “No sir.” “Well,
I'm the man who was to have been married to Mary
Rogers—I'm a man of a good deal of trouble.” He did
not ask for lodging, but <u>enquired</u> the way to Vauxhall
Gardens. He took the brandy when he first came in.—
He<u> said he</u> had lost his hat about half a mile off. He
mentioned no names but that of Mary Rogers.
   W<small>HITNEY</small> recalled.—When Payne came in, he did not
appear to have money. He enquired if there was any
other way to get to New York beside the ferry.
   J<small>OHN</small> <u title="Wood (elsewhere)">W<small>OODS</small></u> examined—I saw the deceased yesterday
about 9 o'clock A. M., was lying on the ground, <u title="apparently">appar-
ly</u> asleep. It was about 100 yards from the second bench
on the walk. There were a number of persons fishing
on Friday, but they were all strangers to me. The place
where I saw deceased lying, was just in front of the
Mansion House. I did not attempt to arouse him.
   C<small>ROMMELIN</small> examined—The body found is that of Dan-
iel Payne. I last saw him two or three days ago.
   W<small>ILLIAM</small> <u title="Latourette (elsewhere)">L<small>ATTARETT</small></u> examined—Saw Daniel Payne
about a quarter past 4 Friday, lying in the stink weeds;
I was going to fetch a doctor, and he lay on his back
snoring and making a dreadful noise; it was near day-
light; another man picked him up, and put him on <u title="Riarty, Ruddy (elsewhere)">Riet-
ty</u>'s stoop, and from thence to Scudder's, and asked for a
drink of water; Scudder said he ought to go where he
got drunk, but he gave him a drink of water, and the de-
ceased stood about half an hour; he then got as far as the
ice house, and he stood there for three quarters of an
hour; then I did not see him again till the afternoon,
when he sat on a bench by the walk, and I made the re-
mark, “there's the man I saw this morning.”<u>
   At this point of the enquire the room was cleared to
admit of the post mortem examination. When the Jury
had been called on the following testimony was adduced.</u>
   S<small>AMUEL</small> G<small>RISWOLD</small> examined—I have been present du-
ring the post mortem examination of the deceased; the
stomach, heart, and lungs appear healthy; the last food
appears to be potatoes; the brain is much congested, but
whether from laudanum or alcohol, or from the position
in which he was found, I cannot tell; cannot find any
trace of poison or <u title="extravasation">extravation</u> of blood, to show he died
from <u title="apoplexy">appoplexy</u>; cannot say from the phial now produc-
ed, that is has contained laudanum, though it is so label-
led; with respect to the cause of death, I should say that
any one who had been drinking and put in that position,
would die.
   Dr. C<small>OOK</small> examined—Myself and the last witness exa-
mined the deceased, and we agree in all important points.
In the stomach I could detect no trace of poison. The
lungs were healthy, but the heart somewhat wasted.—
The liver was merely congested in the veins of the dura
mater, which might be produced from fracture,<u> or</u> falling
from a bench. His manner of living for the two or three
days, would be likely to induce <u title="congestion">conjestion</u>. I could smell
alcohol in the brain but not laudanum. Alcohol would
perpetuate the smell of laudanum. My opinion, as a me-
dical man, is that he has probably fallen in a state of stu-
pefaction, and that peculiar position has been the cause
of his death<u> in my opinion</u>.
   <u title="Ossian (elsewhere)">O. W. C.</u> Loss, a boy 12 years old, examined.—I think I
saw the man dead come into the bar and get a glass of
brandy. He asked if I could not trust. I said no; he
then asked if I knew where Mary Rogers was murdered;
I said yes, and asked if I should show him. He said no,
and went away; I do not know which day it was, either
Thursday or Friday; <u>That man</u> appeared intoxicated,
and went down the lower road.
   W<small>ILLIAM</small> <u title="Busby (elsewhere)">M<small>USBY</small></u>, examined—I think I saw deceased on
Thursday afternoon, about 5 or 6 PM; it was on this side
of Weehawken Hill. It was the place where Mary Ro-
gers was said to be murdered, that he was sitting with a
pocket book in his hand, and appeared to be writing. A
Mr. Wilson who was with me, said, as we passed, “that
the murderer of Mary Rogers ought to be brought and
hung on this spot.” The deceased might have heard but
<u>if he did he </u>made no remark.
   Charles <u>Rietty</u> examined.—I have not seen the deceas-
ed since Friday morning. He was<u> then</u> seated on the
scuttle of my house. Scudder called me; and I saw
him give the man a glass of water, and tell him he must
go away.
   The Jury were locked up for about half an hour, and
then found the following verdict:—“That the said Daniel
C. Payne was found dead, with congestion of the brain,
supposed to be brought about by exposure and irregu-
larity of living, incident to aberration of mind.”</m9>

<d>[Col.4]</d>
   A M<small>YSTERY</small> S<small>OMEWHERE</small>.—It is rumored about town,
on such authority that would shake the doubts of the
most sceptical, that four persons are now in custody
charged with the murder of Mary C. Rogers. On inqui-
ry of the proper authorities at the Egyptian Tombs, it is
denied that any persons are in custody on any such
charge. Knowing the authority on which the rumour
is based, we believe that “the authorities” aforesaid are
throwing dust in the eyes of the press, in the expecta-
tion of some developments.

   The wife of the late Mr. Adams, who was mur-

DEATH OF DANIEL C. PAYNE, <i>the betrothed
		husband of Mary C. Rogers</i>.
				——
   The New-York papers of Saturday, announced
that the body of Mr. Payne, the affianced lover of
the late Mary C. Rogers, was found on Friday
evening, at Hoboken, near the water's edge,
where the body of Miss Rogers was discovered.
The Journal of Commerce gives the following
particulars:
<l9>   An inquest was held by Justice Merritt, of Ho-
boken, acting as coroner, on the body of this in-
dividual, at Hoboken, this morning. It appears
in evidence that since the death of Mary Rogers,
the deceased had been greatly dejected in mind,
which increased upon him. On Thursday after-
noon he left his brother's residence apparently
well. He was next seen, a few hours after on the
spot where Miss Rogers is said to have been mur-
dered with some writing before him, but took no
notice of any one. About ten o'clock at night he
called at the tavern in the village, having lost his
hat and apparently much intoxicated, but with ra-
ther an unusually sleepy appearance. He soon
left the house, having been provided with a hat,
and was next seen about daybreak on Friday morn-
ing lying beside the road, breathing in a <u title="stentorious, stertorous (elsewhere)">stento-
rius</u> manner, and almost senseless. He was rous-
ed up and was again seen in the forenoon in a sim-
ilar condition.
   At 3 o'clock in the afternoon he was seen sitting
on one of the benches near the cave, leaning his
head down. At five o'clock he was found, having
fallen off backwards from the bench, on which
his feet rested, <u title="and was raised (elsewhere)">he was taken</u> up alive, but imme-
diately ceased to breathe.
   This morning his hat and handkerchief and a
broken vial having the odour of laudanum were
found on the spot where Miss Rogers is supposed
to have been murdered. The papers found upon
his person prove to be of no value in relation to
the <u>developement</u> of the murder of Miss Rogers.
A post mortem examination is now taking place,
after which the Jury will render their verdict.</l9>
   P. S. The Sun extra. of Sunday contains a
minute account of the catastrophe, and the find-
ing of the jury:
<l9>   The coroner's jury then rendered a verdict of
“found dead with congestion of the brain, sup-
posed to be brought about by exposure and irreg-
ularity of living, incident to aberration of the
mind.”
   Thus perished the lover and betrothed husband
of the murdered Mary C. Rogers, the victim of
feelings caused by her melancholy death.
   Amongst the papers found on his person were
the following lines, written in pencil:
   “<i>To the World:—Here I am on the spot; God forgive
me for my misfortune<u title=", or for (elsewhere)"> in</u> my misspent time.</i>”
	...
and may his death and that of his beloved Miss
Rogers carry a pang to the bosoms of the mur-
derers, and make them confess their guilt.</l9>

   D<small>ANIEL</small> C. P<small>AYNE</small>.—An inquest was held by
Justice Merritt, of Secaucus, acting as Coroner, on
the body of this individual, at Hoboken, on Satur-
day morning. It appeared in evidence, that since
the death of Mary C. Rogers, the deceased had
been greatly dejected in mind, which had increased
upon him. On Thursday afternoon he left his bro-
ther's residence apparently well. He was next
seen a few hours after on the spot where Miss Ro-
gers is said to have been murdered, with some
writing before him, but he took no notice of any
one. About ten o'clock at night he called at the
tavern in the village, having lost his hat and appa-
rently much intoxicated, and asked for liquor, and
drank half a tumbler full of brandy, said he was
the man who was to have been married to Mary
Rogers, &c. He soon left the house, having been
provided with a hat, and was next seen about day-
break on Friday morning lying beside the road,
breathing in a stentorious manner, and almost sense-
less. He was roused up, and was again seen in the
forenoon in a similar condition.
   At 3 o'clock in the afternoon he was seen sitting
on one of the benches near the Sybil's cave, lean-
ing his head down. At 5 o'clock he was found,
having fallen backwards from the bench, on which
his feet rested, and was raised up alive, but imme-
diately ceased to breathe.
   Next morning his hat and handkerchief and a
broken vial, having the odour of laudanum, were
found on the spot where Miss Rogers is supposed to
have been murdered. The papers found upon his
person prove to be of no value in relation to the de-
velopment of the murder of Miss Rogers. Dr.
Griswold executed a post mortem examination of
the body, and deposed that he found the heart,
lungs and stomach perfectly healthy, the brain con-
gested, no signs of poison in the stomach, and not
sufficient appearances to induce the existence of
apoplexy. The Doctor opined that any person, af-
ter hard drinking, and found in his situation, with
his head down, would come to his death without
taking poison. He further stated that he could not
trace the immediate cause of death, though he
could smell alcohol in the brain; said there was
no <u title="poison">pioson</u> in the stomach, which was, however,
taken out, in order to analyze the contents, and
thought that if the deceased had fallen from the
bench in a state of stupor it was the cause of his
death. The jury found a verdict—Found dead,
with congestion of the brain, supposed to be
brought about by exposure and irregularity of liv-
ing, incident to aberration of mind.—<i>Journal of

	[<i>From the N. Y. Commercial Advertiser</i>.]
		<b>ANOTHER MYSTERY!</b>
   The morning papers announced that the body of
Mr. Payne, the affianced lover of the late Mary C.
Rogers, was found last evening at Hoboken, near the
water's edge, where the body of Miss Rogers was
discovered.
   Two of the penny journals add that he was found
with his throat cut. It was further stated that Mr.
Justice Merritt, of Hoboken, had last evening <u title="empanelled">em-
pannelled</u> an inquest to sit upon the body at 11 o'-
clock, this morning.
   In consequence of these publications, we repaired
to Hoboken this morning, and were in attendance
upon the inquisition until one o'clock, when we left
in order to give the results of the investigation thus
far. We have no space, however, to give the testi-
mony elicited in detail, and a very summary nar-
rative must suffice.
   In the first place it is not true that the throat of
the deceased was cut. On the contrary there is no
wound upon the body, but a severe mark upon his
nose, as though it had been scraped by a fall. This
mark, moreover, was upon his face, according to the
testimony of his brother—a very respectable looking
man—at dinner on Thursday.
   It appears by the testimony of the witness that
the deceased was strongly attached to Mary Rogers.
—Since her death he has been moody, and as wit-
ness thought, not exactly in his right mind. He has
not been habitually intemperate. Witness had only
seen him in liquor once during the last three years.
On Thursday of the present week he dined at home.
—He appeared melancholy, and as though he had
been drinking a little. Observing the scratch upon
his nose, witness asked him how it came. He said
he did not know. Witness had not seen him after
dinner on that day, until he saw his dead body.
   In regard to the time and manner in which the de-
ceased came by his death, a Dr. Griswold, of New-
York, testified that he was walking with a friend
along the gravel path toward the grotto at the point,
when they saw a man prostrate upon one of the seats
by the way-side, near where the body of Mary Ro-
gers was found.
   His head was down upon the gravel, and his legs
across the bench. He ran and raised him up—saw
he was near his end—observed a convulsion of the
chest. He died in two or three minutes. He had no
hat on, but an old chip hat lay near him. (This hat
was produced.)
   While another witness was under examination,
but testifying to no material point, additional inter-
est was created by the arrival of two young men
from the spot where it is supposed Mary Rogers was
murdered, bringing with them a hat, a white pocket
handkerchief, and the fragments of a vial, the body
of which yet contained a few drops of laudanum. It
was labelled laudanum, from <u title="Souillard & Delluc (elsewhere)">Place & Souillard</u>'s.
   Mr. Payne at once identified the hat as belonging
to his brother. He purchased it in Chatham street;
and it had the crape which the deceased had placed
upon it in mourning for Mary Rogers. Of the hand-
kerchief the witness knew nothing.
   The pocket-book, or large <u title="wallet">walet</u>, with some papers
together with a segar case, and the spectacles of the
deceased, were identified as his by Mr. Payne.
   The manner of the discovery of the hat was this.
The deceased was a cork-cutter by trade. The two
young men who came in with the hat are of the same
trade.
   Seeing the paragraph in the morning papers, they
went over to Hoboken at 9 o'clock, and supposing
that the inquest would be held where the body was
found, they walked up to that place—and falling in
with a straggler, proceeded on, and inquired the way
to the place where it is supposed Mary was murder-
ed. They went to Nick Moore's house, and Mrs.
Loss, the landlady, directed them to the place.
   They found it—as has often been described—se-
cluded—overgrown with shrubbery, like an arbor.—
On looking in they saw the hat, and on going in dis-
covered also the handkerchief and the broken pieces
of phial. [With these they immediately returned, and
inquired for the coroner's inquest. The hat is nearly
new, newly brushed, or ironed, and quite glossy.]
   From the other testimony which we heard, it was
proved that toward evening on Thursday a man,
supposed to be the deceased, was seen by two men,
who were passing by, sitting by the entrance into
the bower of the murder, apparently engaged in wri-
ting. One of the passers-by remarked—“the man
who murdered Mary Rogers ought to be hung up in
that tree.” The person writing did not look up, or
appear to notice the remark.
   The next heard of the deceased was at about ten
o'clock on Thursday night, when he came into the
tavern of Mr. Smith, in the village of Hoboken,
without a hat. Said he had lost his hat half a mile
off and wanted another. He looked as though he
had been drinking somewhat. He called for brandy,
and drank about half a tumbler. Paid one shilling
for it. He talked rationally. Said he was the man
who was engaged to be married to Miss Rogers,
that he was a man of a good deal of trouble.
   He talked of coming over to the city. Was told
that the ferry boats had stopped for the night, want-
ed to hire a passage over, but said he was short of
cash; inquired for Vauxhall Garden, and was shown
the direction, when he left.
   By another witness it appeared that he was next
seen between five and six o'clock yesterday morn-
ing, lying among some tall weeds about a quarter of
a mile from the place last mentioned. He groaned
heavily.
   The witness who found him, called another man,
and they went and lifted him up. He groaned again
and could hardly breathe—fell down several times.
They took him to a small tavern, but the landlord,
supposing him drunk, would not let him in. Gave
him a gentle shove back, and he fell down. Wit-
ness seated him upon the stoop, and left him to go to
his work.
   The next notice elicited of him was the account of
his death, as stated by the first witness. The place
where he was found was about half a mile from the
tavern last mentioned.
   Mrs. Loss, the landlady of “Nick Moore's
House,” testified positively that the deceased was
not the man whom she saw at her house with Mary
Rogers on the 25th of July. The man was both
younger and smaller than the deceased.
   The strangest feature in this tragic story, is the
fact that the hat and <u title="handkerchief">hankerchief</u> were perfectly dry
when found. It had rained, as we all know, yester-
day, nearly all day, and much in the night.
   The Mayor of this city, and Justices Taylor and
Stevens, are assisting Justice Merritt at the exami-
nation.

last horrible act has “filled up the measure of his cup

We are informed that the intelligence of the arrest
of his son, which he first learned by hearing a stran-

his reason from its throne, and made a wreck of all

	<b>Court of Oyer and Terminer.</b>
Present Judge Kent, and Aldermen Leonard and
		Woodhull.
   O<small>CT</small>.11.—<i>The Trial of Colt</i>.—At 10 o'clock pre-
cisely the prisoner was placed at the bar. His
face bore the same pallid, anxious appearance
which it did at the inquest. He appeared, howev-
er, a trifle thinner, but firmly prepared to bear the
brunt of his situation. His lips were compressed
together, and he kept his eyes on the Court nearly
the whole time. On the whole, his deportment
was as much in accordance as could be conceived,
with one in his hapless situation.
   The District Attorney having moved on the
trial, Robert <u>Emmett</u>, Esq., with whom were as-
sociated Prescott Hall and John A. Morrill, rose
to move that the trial of John C. Colt be postpon-
ed until next term, on account of the absence of
important witnesses, necessary to the defence of
the prisoner at the bar. The learned gentleman
	...
   The motion was supported by J. P<small>RESCOTT</small> H<small>ALL</small>,
in a very able address. The learned gentleman
alluded to the poor and friendless situation of the
prisoner, and to the fact that the Counsel had,
with considerable difficulty, and much inconve-
nience, made what progress they could towards ob-
taining evidence, and he believed, solemnly, on his
professional word, that from what he could gather
of the nature of the matter to be produced to the
Court and Jury, on the part of the prisoner, that it
would materially alter the color of the crime with
which he now stood charged.
   The D<small>ISTRICT</small> A<small>TTORNEY</small> opposed the motion, in
a very able and eloquent speech. He alluded to the
case of Ezra White, where, from repeated delays,
the ends of justice had been finally perverted. The
evidence in this case was to be sustained by up-
wards of thirty witnesses, and among them was the
mate of the ship, who had been detained in a mo-
neyless condition, and who, if he did not depart to
join his ship at New Orleans, would be thrown out
of employ, and probably compelled to seek his liv-
ing before the mast. The learned gentleman alluded
to the practice in the English Courts, where prison-
ers, charged with this awful crime, had been ar-
rested, tried, found guilty, and executed, within
the term; and, in conclusion, stated it to be his
firm intention to press this case on, according to
the notice he had given at the commencement of the
term of this Court.
	...		Judge Kent
delivered the opinion of the Court.
   “The Court did not perceive any thing either in
the affidavit or the application of the counsel to au-
thorise the Court in putting off this trial be-
yond the present term. It was the most pain-
ful which the Court had to perform, but they
felt bound to discharge it strictly—impar-
	...
The Court were willing to wait and give any rea-
sonable time. They would give a week or a fort-
night, or to the very verge of the term, but be-
yond that the Court would not delay the case. If
	...
   Mr. Prescott Hall subsequently applied for ano-
ther week's delay and then it was understood by all
parties that the trial was to commence next Mon-
day fortnight, the testimony of the mate to be taken
<i>de bene esse</i>.
   Colt was immediately removed into the sheriff's
office, and from thence conveyed back to “the
tombs” in a cab.
   And the Court adjourned.

   T<small>HE</small> T<small>RIAL OF</small> C<small>OLT</small>, for the murder of Mr.
Adams, was last week set down for to-day. Wheth-
er it has come on, we are not informed. We have
been desired by Mr. Lane, the father of Mrs. Adams,
whom we have long known as a member of Doctor
Spring's church, to state that the report going the
rounds of the papers, of her being deprived of her
senses, is entirely without foundation; and however
acute may be her sense of her loss, she bears it with
a becoming resignation to the Divine will.
   In reply to our inquiries last evening, Mr. Lane
assured us that the current statements in some of the
papers, in relation to the remarkable pre-monitory
dreams of Mrs. Adams, are true. Two days before
her husband's disappearance, she dreamed, twice,
that he was murdered, and that she saw his body cut
into pieces and packed in a box. The dreams gave
her great concern, from their vividness, and she went
once to relate them to her mother, but did not, from
the apprehension of being laughed at.—<i title="N. Y. Commercial Advertiser, October 11, 1841">Com. Adv.</i>

   We received the following extract from a
subscriber, with a request to publish it for the
rising generation. He says he does not know
the author, or he would give him credit for his
piece; but he says, “they are his sentiments
exactly.” We hope our fair readers may pro-
fit by it, and that our subscriber may not be
made ever again to suffer from their <i>feet</i> (i. e.)
if he has ever been kicked by any of them.
<l9>   <i>Woman's Heart</i>.—There will always be
a great deal of misery in the world, while
the present system of education, which
renders it unmaidenly to evince the <u>hearts</u>
emotions, continues. It has been said
that a man should not be discouraged at
his first ill success, and that a woman's
heart which is worth a <u title="siege">seige</u>; and will be
the more prized for the difficulty that is
experienced in obtaining it. This logic,
like a great deal of other logic, predicated
upon a false position, is unsubstantial. In
ninety nine cases out of a hundred, the
lover, whose whole soul is engrossed in that
of his mistress, and whose love is worth
obtaining, retires from the <u title="siege">seige</u>, under a
feeling of true delicacy, that his manifest
attentions have not met with that return,
which an apparent passion, if reciproca-
ted, would have caused; while a cold cal-
culating lover, whose heart is not worth a
fraction of that which felt so much for its
idol, by his very importunity, succeeds.—
We are not so Quixotic as to suppose that
we can, by our writing, change the current
of fashionable education; but if in one sin-
gle instance our remarks on this subject
can turn a good girl from the error of her
tutored ways, we shall be satisfied. Wo-
men have all enough of natural <u title="coquetry">conquetry</u>
in their disposition, without having recourse
to art, and yet bountiful as nature has been
in this respect, art not content with being
her handmaid, has become her mistress,
and lauded it over her in triumph. The
happiness of a life is not a small matter,
and an engagement that must last till death,
should be well weighed before being enter-
ed upon. So ladies—dear ladies—you
know that you are dear to us—when you
have found an object worthy your love,
whose passion is apparent—throw to the
winds, the precepts of schoolmistresses,
maiden aunts, and antiquated cousins, or
kind acquaintances, who are but jealous of
your good fortune. Reserve your rules
of etiquette for ordinary occasions.—
Evince the emotions that you feel—the
emotions of a true, warm and confiding
heart will make you doubly dear to him
who loves it. Remember that delays are
dangerous—that there is many a slip 'twixt
cup and lip. Throw aside at once, and
forever, all foolish affectations, and secure
your own happiness.

		CAUTION.
   An exchange paper chronicles the death
of a young child in New York, produced
by taking a lucifer match in its mouth—
the composition on the end of the stick dis-
solved in the mouth—was swallowed by
the child, and the consequence was im-
mediate death. Parents and nurses should
be particularly careful to keep these match-
es out of the reach of children, as the pre-
paration in which they are dipt is a viru-
lent poison.—<i>Asheville Messenger</i>.

	INOCULATION OF ANIMALS.
   The spread of the <u title="murrain">murrian</u> among cattle
and sheep in the south—for, fortunately,
we are free from it in the Highlands—has
suggested a step which seems strange to
the uninitiated—the inoculation of stock
with the view of mitigating or preventing
the serious attacks of the distemper. This
has been tried in the south, and we believe
there is no instance of the <u title="inoculated">innoculated</u> ani-
mal taking the complaint when it is rife in
the district. At our wool fair last week,
Mr. Pagan, salesman in Liverpool, recom-
mended this subject to the attention of our
Highland farmers. The stock seized with
murrain suffer little on farms, and are ea-
sily cured; but when they are driven on
roads to the market while laboring under
its effects, it often proves fatal. As a meas-
ure of precaution, Mr. Pagan recommended
that all stock should be inoculated at home.
With respect to this inoculation of animals
Mr. Mackenzie, of Applecross, Mr. P., re-
marked at the same time, that a lady in
London (sister of Captain Marryatt) who
had several pet dogs, was in the habit of
<u title="inoculating">innoculating</u> them, and not one took the
distemper.—<i>Inverness Courier</i>.

   D<small>EATH OF</small> D<small>ANIEL</small> C. P<small>AYNE</small>.—This
person, the reputed lover of Mary C. Ro-
gers, was found dead at Hoboken on Friday.
The Express says,
   “Payne, it is well known, was a very
intemperate man, and since the death of Miss
Rogers he had become even more so than
usual, having been rarely seen since that
time in a perfectly sober state.
   He had not been at his lodgings since
Thursday last, an no trace of him had been
discovered until yesterday evening about 5
o'clock, when he was seen by a man who
was going fishing, siting on a bench in the
woods at Hoboken, close to the spot where
the body of the murdered girl was found.
He appeared to be either dozing or to be so
intoxicated as to be scarcely able to sit upright.
Soon afterwards he was seen to fall back-
wards, and when the person reached him he
was dying. He was immediately conveyed
to a house close by, but before they reached
it he was dead.
   Several papers were found upon his per-
son, but none, so far as we can learn, will
be likely to throw any light on the mystery
of the murder. They were principally me-
morandums—he had written down the date
of every examination he <u>under went</u> before
the Mayor, and probably the last he ever
wrote was in pencil on the back one of the
papers, to the following effect:
“I am on the very spot—God forgive me
for my misspent time.”
   The general impression is, that the un-
fortunate man has fallen a victim to his in-
temperate habits, and his death was caused
by delirium tremens, and such will probably
be the verdict of the jury.

   J<small>OHN</small> C. C<small>OLT</small>.—The New York papers give
many items of the history of this young man, some
of them perverted statements of facts, but mostly
mere fabrications to meet the craving demands of
excited curiosity. It may be a question how far
public curiosity should be gratified in such a case.
We are disposed to enquire whether this morbid
taste for the details of crime, may not help to pro-
vide materials for its own gratification; and whe-
ther the Newgate literature of our day has not in it
the elements of self-perpetuation. We do not ask
for apathy or indifference to crime; its frequent
recurrence, in such horrid forms, calls for the most
vigilant interest; but not for that fascinated inte-
rest, that shuddering admiration, with which we
have suffered ourselves to be drawn into sympathy
with vice, under the masterly delineations of per-
verted genius, until we have come to look upon
great wickedness as great romance.
   The simple facts in the history of John C. Colt,
as they have been made known to us, by those who
were familiar with him from childhood, would need
but little adornment to present a tale as attractive
as any of its class. We could not ask for better
materials from which to furnish forth a hero, than
the fine person, the generous impulses, and the un-
bounded mental energy which we could vouch for
in him. He has shown a self-reliance, and a stern
resolution, in overcoming the difficulties of a devi-
ous course that, to interest, would need little help
from fictitious surroundings, and an eagerness and
perseverance in intellectual culture that would
command sympathy and just admiration.
   We wish we could transfer to the minds of the
thousands who so eagerly read all that is said of
him, the one impressive lesson we are taught, as
we trace the evil in this case back to its germ.
That germ whose growth has been so bitter, was
<i>insubordination</i> from his childhood upwards.
His whole course has been marked by self-will,
breaking through all the common <u title="restraints">restrains</u> of the
family, of the school-room, of the counting-house,
of social life, and of the law of God. <i>John C.
Colt has been for fourteen years a voluntary
exile from the parental roof</i>. Let the child who
will not submit to be checked and guided, tremble
for the end of his own career; and let the parent
tremble for the child who cannot be made to yield
to just authority, and let him never dare to hope
that the youth whom he cannot control, will learn
to control himself, and curb his own wild passions.

<d>[Col.7 / More in <a class="e" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=x4MoAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA297">Hunt's Merchants' Magazine. October, 1841</a>]</d><!-- Some text is from Long-Islander-1841-10-22 -->
   T<small>HE</small> C<small>OMMERCIAL</small> S<small>TRENGTH OF</small> R<small>USSIA</small>.—
The last number of Hunt's Merchants' Magazine
contains an article upon this subject which devel-
opes the amazing power of Russia, and from which
we publish a brief abstract that will be found
highly interesting. It shows that there is abun-
dant reason for the jealousies existing in other
parts of Europe against that great and growing
nation.
   The entire Russian empire is nearly twice and
a half times as large as all Europe—its population
is about one fourth of that of Europe, though its
Asiatic possessions contribute but about one
sixth of its whole population. Of the whole ex-
tent of over two billions of acres, less than one
sixth of the soil is under improvement. The mines
are a great source of wealth, the annual produce
being estimated in 1835 to be thirty-eight millions
of dollars.
   In manufactures Russia has rapidly advanced
since their first establishment by Peter the Great.
From the returns of 1828 it is found that of linen
nine millions of yards are annually produced; of
woollen cloths, of all kinds, about 600,000 yards;
of cotton 40,000,000 of yards; of silk to the value
of 3,000,000 of Prussian dollars; of leather <u title="3.5 mil. hides, 2,400,000-3,000,000 Prussian dollars (in Hunt's)">three
and a half millions of the same coin</u>; of potash
2,000,000 pounds; of soap, 80,000,000 pounds; and
of tallow <u title="16,000,000 (in Hunt's)">16,800,000</u> of pounds are annually used
by the candle manufactories. Thirty-nine mil-
lions of pounds of sugar are annually refined—
and the various distilleries in the empire employ
over seven hundred thousand workmen.
   In 1834 the total value of Russia exports was
$50,133,758, and of imports, $53,652,568. In 1832
5720 vessels entered, and 5721 vessels left the
Russian ports. England draws off one half, and
the United States one-twelfth of the exports.—
The amount realized by the government from du-
ties on both exports and imports, is about 25 per
cent, of the whole value, or in 1834 about four-
teen millions of dollars. Of the articles of im-
port, sugar forms one sixth of the whole importa-
tion; coffee, one thirty-sixth; cotton, one sixth; co-
loring stuffs, one tenth; silk goods, one twentieth;
woollens, one thirtieth; wine, one twentieth; tea,
one fortieth; and tobacco, one hundredth. Of ex-
ports, flax and hemp make one third of the whole;
tallow, one sixth; corn and meal, about one
sixth; bristles, hides and leather, one twentieth.
   Were we so disposed, a piteous tale might be
told of the ridiculous impolicy of the popular pro-
tective system, as exhibited in Russia; for in no
country is this system so fully developed. It is
joined, we admit, with the most sickening despot-
ism and the most cruel monopoly ever invented by
man, yet more than enough of evil exists, which
may be laid directly at the foot of a system, in a
country where for every dollar admitted to its
ports, one-third accrues to the government. But
our only object, at present, is to present a few
facts, showing the tremendous commercial power
of Russia, yet in its infancy, and growing in des-
pite of all the chains with which the protective
system binds the energies of the country. For, it
so happens, that while we can plainly see how
much more rapid might have been and still be the
course of Russia, under more favorable laws, it is
equally true, that within the last century her
strides have been like the giant's of a fairy le-
gend. Russia, in the east, and America in the
west, seem destined to be <small>THE</small> nations for the fu-
ture, and their only but glorious difference in the
past seems to be, that while in America prosperity
has made happy <small>THE</small> P<small>EOPLE</small>, in Russia it has
added to the wealth and power of the masters, and
hung new fetters on the souls and bodies of the
slaves.
   From the few facts we have presented may be
imagined the great and yet infant rival of England
in the councils of Europe.

   			<i>For the Evening Post</i>.
   M<small>R</small>. E<small>DITOR</small>: So many journals have comment-
ed on my late verdict against Mr. Park Benjamin,
that every one will feel I have a right to insist that
the <i>facts</i>, at least, should be correctly stated. I
have hoped you would enable me to use a column
for this purpose.
   I sued Mr. Benjamin for a libel. The issue made
by this suit, was the <i>truth</i> or <i>falsehood</i> of the inju-
rious imputations; as is always the case, in an ac-
tion of this sort. The <i>truth</i> is a complete justifica-
tion of any libel, in the civil action; the truth <i>with
good motive</i>, in the criminal proceedings, and in
the state of New York.
   Mr. Benjamin published my declaration, and en-
deavored to ridicule the idea that he had wronged
me. He collected several similar opinions from
different journals, and published them also, under
the designation of a “verdict of the Press.” Had
this verdict been worth any thing, I should have
been defeated, out of all question. Viewing it how-
ever, as no more than an outbreaking of unrepressed
presumption, acting on an inflated ignorance, I let
the law take its course, and have already reversed
the decision.
   Mr. Benjamin next demurred to my declaration.
The effect of this demurrer was to admit my alle-
gations, but to deny that the matter charged was
libellous. The question came before the Supreme
Court at the term of July, 1840. It was submitted
without argument. I proposed the latter course,
because I did not think the legal objections raised,
<i>worth an argument</i>; the counsel opposed con-
sented to it, for reasons I shall not pretend to give.
The judgment on demurrer was in favor of the
plaintiff, with leave to the defendant to amend, on
payment of costs.
   The rule for judgment was entered on the 4th of
Nov., and Mr. Benjamin was bound to plead and
pay his costs by the 24th, or suffer a default. He
did neither; and we served an informal notice on
the 4th of January, to say if he did not plead and
pay his costs by the 20th of that month, we would
enter a default and resist any attempt to set it aside.
Even the 20th brought no plea, and we granted
more time. A special plea was finally served,
about the 22d of January. This plea was set aside
by the Supreme Court, on our motion, as <small>FRIVO-
LOUS</small>. Leave was given to the defendant to plead
anew, after notice; but he declined to do so, and
we finally entered our default.
   There remained only to take an inquest. This
is ordinarily done before a sheriff's jury; but the
Supreme Court sent this inquest to the Circuit, on
our motion, on the ground that the defendant <i>had
been discussing the merits of the suit in his news-
paper</i>. The inquest was accordingly held before
Judge Gridley, at the last Otsego circuit. I got a
verdict of $375. The penalty of this libel, there-
fore, with all the costs, &c., will amount, I should
suppose, to some $700 or $800. Mr. Benjamin
seems to think it a very insignificant sum, from
which circumstance, I hope he intends to pay it.
   Any one acquainted with the course of the law,
knows that when a defendant, in a libel suit, comes
into court <i>without a plea</i>, it is putting himself in
the most deprecating attitude before the jury. He
admits the falsehood of his charges, and substantial-
ly asks for mercy. The effect is always to lessen
the damages.
   I proceeded against Mr. Benjamin, in this case,
for two reasons. His libel was prevaricating; first
stating charges and then protesting that the writer
“could not believe them.” It struck me that my
libeller wished to screen himself behind a subter-
fuge, that neither reason nor the law will tolerate.
Next, the libel appeared to me to be intended to
bully a citizen from pursuing his remedies at law;
being connected with a previous suit brought against
Mr. Wm. L. Stone, for a similar wrong.
   That I was right in the first impression, was
shown by the special plea, which set forth that the
defendant had stated in the libellous article, that
<i>he could not believe</i> what were, virtually, his own
allegations; all of which, as already mentioned, the
court set aside as <small>FRIVOLOUS</small>. To show that I was
not mistaken in my second construction of the li-
bel, I extract a paragraph from the opinion of the
Supreme Court, given with the judgment on de-
murrer, which opinion will, no doubt, be found at
length in the next volume of Wendell.
   ——“There is another feature, which, if not
sufficient, in itself, to give it the character of a libel
against the plaintiff, renders it (Mr. Benjamin's ar-
ticle) at least <i>criminal</i>, and <i>deserving of punishment
in some form</i>. It did not require the avowal of
the defendant to see that it was intended to aid <i>in
deterring the plaintiff from the prosecution of his
rights in a court of justice, either by the terror of
calumny, or by creating an influence adverse to
his recovery of damages</i>.”

in his coffin, but no sooner was he dropped in it
than he jumped up and asked where they were
going to place him. They then conducted him in
a carriage to a colored nurse woman's house. He
is yet very sick, but may perhaps live. It appears
that he was in a state of lethargy.

   A <small>CUTE AND CURIOUS</small> A<small>FFAIR</small>.—James <u title="C. Cole, E. Coles (elsewhere)">E. Cole</u>
who was <a class="l" href="#American-1840-08-08">sentenced to the State Prison for fifteen
years</a>, about a year since, for highway robbery in
this city, contrived an ingenious mode of escape,
which, however, lacked the most material part, suc-
cess. It was after this wise: Cole has been employed
in the shop making boxes, in which materials are
sent from the prison to this city; he made one, and
put buttons on the lid, so as to fasten it inside, and
then drove nails around the edge, breaking them off;
thus giving it the appearance of being nailed down;
then directed it himself to Mr. <u title="A. Larue, J. Lane, John Lerue (elsewhere)">John Larue</u>, corner of
Madison and <u title="Rutgers (elsewhere)">Pike</u> streets in this city. Having thus
far arranged, he employed a negro convict to place
it, after he had fastened himself in, on board the
sloop Fanny, to be brought to this city. The box
was placed on the wharf, <i>head down</i>, and remained
there for about two hours, when it was put in the ca-
bin of the sloop.
   The sloop started during the gale yesterday, but
was obliged to put back, and did not arrive until this
morning. In the meantime, Mr. Lent, one of the
keepers, missed Cole, and came down to the city to
look for him; not hearing of him here and learning
that the Fanny had not arrived, he mistrusted that
Cole was on board, he therefore boarded her this
morning on her arrival, and going into the cabin saw
the box and opened it where he found Cole nearly <u title="exhausted">ex-
hasuted</u>, from his close confinement and not having
eaten anything since yesterday. Cole was imme-
diately taken to the Tombs and will be returned to
his old quarters at 3 o'clock this afternoon.

   A<small>TTEMPT TO</small> E<small>SCAPE IN A</small> B<small>OX</small>.—On the 3d
of August, 1840, a man named James <u title="E. Coles (elsewhere)">C. Cole</u>, of
desperately depraved character, who had been be-
fore in the State Prison, was again sentenced to
that institution for robbery in the first degree—in
pointing a loaded pistol at the breast of a broker
in Greenwich-street, and crying out, “Your money,
or your life.” Wearied of his imprisonment, Cole
last week conceived the plan of escaping; and as
he was engaged in box-making, he resolved to go
off from the prison in a box. For this purpose he
dressed off and fitted up an empty sugar-box, drove
nails through the top and broke the points off, and
placed wooden buttons inside the lid to fasten into
grooves in the sides; and having nailed it, and di-
rected it to <u title="A. Larue, J. Lane (elsewhere)">John Lerue</u>, corner of <u title="Rutgers (elsewhere)">Pike</u> and Madi-
son streets, and instructed two of the convicts to
put the box on board the sloop Fanny, he got in,
bent himself up, fastened the lid, and was carried
by the two convicts, soon after dinner, and placed
on the wharf, head downward, where he remained
half an hour before he was taken on board. The
sloop sailed, with Mr. Lent, one of the Prison
keepers, on board as a passenger, who had no sus-
picion of the contents of the box. A storm of wind
sprung up, however, which carried away one of
the sails when a few miles out, and the sloop put
back to Sing Sing to refit; when Mr. Lent, the
keeper, left her, and she soon after resumed her
voyage toward this city.
   The box containing Cole having been placed in
the cabin where there was a rousing fire, the poor
inmate became almost completely roasted and near-
ly suffocated for want of fresh air, and twice faint-
ed in his “narrow house”—wishing himself back
in his old quarters, the prison. In the interim his
escape having been discovered, and communicated
to Mr. Lent, the keeper, he at once bethought him
of the boxes on board the sloop, and taking pas-
sage on board the first steamer, arrived in this city
before the sloop, and proceeded on board of her
as soon as she touched the wharf. There, on knock-
ing the lid off the box, he found Cole all doubled
and bent up, nearly dead from his confined posi-
tion, want of air and abstinence from food and
drink for about 18 hours. He was lifted out and
conveyed to prison in this city, where he recovered
sufficiently to be taken back to Sing Sing in irons,
on Saturday afternoon, there to suffer from the dis-
ciplinary appointments of the prison—a severe
punishment for smuggling himself off in a box,
and then to serve out his long term of imprison-
ment unless death shall grant a discharge.

   A <small>CONVICT IN A BAD BOX</small>.—A desperado named
James <u title="E. Coles (elsewhere)">C. Cole</u>, who had before graduated in the
state prison, was on the 3d August, 1840, senten-
ced to the state prison for 15 years, for an aggra-
vated case of robbery in the 1st degree, (called
highway robbery) in presenting a loaded pistol to
the breast of a broker in Greenwich street, and
crying out “your money or your life.” In the
state prison he was employed in box making, and
last week planed off and fitted up an old sugar box,
driving nails through the edge of the top and break-
ing off the points putting wooden buttons under
the lid so as to turn into small furrows in the sides
and made small holes to let in the air. Having
secured the aid of two convicts, on Friday after
dinner he marked the box, directing it to <u title="A. Larue, John Lerue (elsewhere)">J. Lane</u>,
corner of <u title="Rutgers (elsewhere)">Pike</u> and Madison streets, and getting in-
to it and doubling himself up, secured the lid, and
was carried to the wharf to be put on board the
sloop Fanny, for New York, the convicts by mis-
take putting the box on end with his head down-
wards. In this state he continued for half an hour,
when he was carried on board the sloop and she
set sail with Mr. Lent, one of the prison keepers
on board, who knew nothing of the convict in the
box. The sloop, when a few miles on her voy-
age, was injured in her sails by a squall, and had
to put back to Sing Sing to refit, where the keeper
left her, and the repairs completed, the sloop re-
sumed her voyage towards this city.
   On the passage, the box was placed in the cabin
near the stove, and used as a seat by those on
board, and became so tremendously hot that Cole
fainted twice with the heat and confined air, and
came near suffocating. Meanwhile, the keeper,
who landed from the sloop at Sing Sing, hearing
of the escape of Cole, and having seen the box
on board, rightly supposed he had stowed himself
in it, and taking the first steamboat, arrived in the
city before the sloop, which he boarded as soon
as it touched the wharf, and knocking off the lid
of the box, there found Cole, doubled up, nearly
dead, and so stiffened by his position that when
hauled out he was unable to stand. He was car-
ried to the City prison, and there locked up until
Saturday afternoon, when he was put on board a
steamer in irons, and taken by the keeper sent
back to Sing Sing, to serve out the remaining long
years of his term of imprisonment, and to taste
the bitterness of a terrible flagellation for his un-
successful attempt to escape.

<d>[Col.1]</d><!-- Some text is from Farmer-1841-10-26 -->
   <i>Ingenious escape—almost</i>.—A convict named James
<u title="C. Cole, E. Coles (elsewhere)">E. Cole</u>, sentenced to the State Prison at Sing Sing
for fourteen years, of which he had served out four
only, was near making his escape from his quarters
on Saturday, by a plan which certainly was very
ingenious though not so successful as he hoped.
   He made a large boot box, with buttons on the in-
side of the lid, to catch on the sides and ends of the
box inside. The nails in this cover were driven
around the edges, but broken off even with the un-
derside of the lid, so as to appear as if the cover was
nailed snugly down. Into this box, which was di-
rected to a person in this City, <u>Coles</u> secreted himself,
and buttoning down the cover, in due time was taken
on board the sloop Fanny, plying between Sing Sing
and this city, and the vessel started off with a fair
wind. On the passage down the Fanny lost her top-
mast, and was thus delayed some five or six hours,
and reached this city about 7 o'clock on Saturday
morning instead of 2 or 3 o'clock as was expected.
In the evening when the convicts came to be return-
ed to their cells, <u>Coles</u> was missed, and suspecting
that he had smuggled himself on board the Fanny
some of the keepers started down by land, and reach-
ed here before the Fanny, and on her arrival she was
well overhauled, and just as the search was about to
be given up, the box in which Cole was secreted came
under their view, and the hapless prisoner was brought
to light. He was immediately ironed and conducted
to the City Prison, whence he started the same
morning for Sing Sing to finish his time of service.

<i>To the Editor of the Evening Post</i>:
   Since you have allowed Mr. J. Fenimore Coop-
er to encroach upon <a class="l" href="#Evening-Post-1841-10-15">your columns</a> so far as to regale
the public with a history of his late libel suit a-
gainst Park Benjamin, you will, of course, accord
to the latter humble individual the privilege of a
reply.
<l9>   Mr. Cooper, rather disingenuously force me in-
to positions which I never occupied, and attributes
to me proceedings in which I had a little part
or lot as one man can have in a business which he
commits wholly to the discretion of another. That
I “published <i>his</i> declaration and endeavored to ridi-
cule the idea of my having wronged <i>him</i>,” is most
true; and it is equally true that I “collected se-
veral opinions from different journals and publish-
ed them also, under the designation of a 'Verdict
of the Press.'” But here the truth ceases, inas-
much as I was not directly active in conducting the
defence of the suit which he instituted; although
Mr. Cooper, taking a strictly legal view of the
matter, may say “<i title="“he who acts through another, acts himself”">qui facit per alium facit per se</i>.”
The whole affair, from first to last, was en-
trusted to a gentleman “learned in the law,”
in whose skill and ability I reposed entire
confidence. The only opinion I ventured to
express, was soon after the service of Mr.
Cooper's declaration; and that was, that the
case should go immediately to a jury, and be tried
on its merits. My attorney, however, thought
differently, and so did other able counsellors, who
were consulted. They advised a demurrer, be-
cause there was no libel in the article on which the
suit was brought. I accordingly succumbed to the
lawyers, and did not afterwards suffer the subject
to molest me, except when it was urged upon my
attention.
   Mr. Cooper says,—“the penalty of the libel,
with all the cost, &c. will amount to some $700
or $800. Mr. Benjamin seems to think it a very
insignificant sum, from which circumstance I hope
he intends to pay it.” I do not know from what
premises Mr. Cooper has inferred that I think the
penalty “an insignificant sum.” If he <u title="alluded">allude</u> to a
careless remark made, some weeks since, in “The
New World,” I certainly did not mean, by what I
then wrote, to insinuate any contempt for the
amount of the damages, or any disrespect for the
judgment of the Court; but simply to show how
great a discrepance existed between the sum of
$375—the jury's estimate of the injury sustained
by the plaintiff—and $10,000—the estimate of Mr.
Cooper himself.
   With regard to the “two reasons” given by Mr.
Cooper, why he proceeded against me, viz: that I
“wished to screen myself behind a subterfuge.”
and “intended to bully a citizen from pursuing his
remedies at law.” I have to state that the portion
of the paragraph in my paper, construed to be
libellous, was extracted from the Courier & En-
quirer. Mr. Cooper was charged by Mr. Webb
with having commenced a libel-suit against Mr. W.
L. Stone, editor of the Commercial Advertiser, for
the purpose of promoting the sale of his “<a href="http://archive.org/details/cihm_42713" title="1839, vol.1">Naval
History</a> <a href="http://archive.org/details/cihm_42714" title="1839, vol.2">of the United States</a>.” I expressed my
disbelief, and intimated that, whatever might have
been Mr. Cooper's former faults, he could “not be
capable of such baseness.” As to “bullying a citi-
zen from pursuing his remedies at law,” I never
dreamed of so broad an interpretation of my mo-
tives until now. Moreover, I was aware that Mr.
Cooper was neither to be bullied nor persuaded
into any course adverse to the dictates of his own
will, and consistent with the dignity of his ancient
reputation.
   This view of the case, strange as it seems to me,
was also taken by the Supreme Court. In the
opinion of that Court, as quoted by Mr. Cooper, a
judgment is passed upon my <i>intentions</i>. Is not
this new, sir? Is it not indeed strange, that any
judge should assume for himself an attribute of the
deity, and pronounce upon the secret thoughts and
motives of men? Does not a sentence like this
fall within the prohibition, “judge not, that ye be
not judged?” It was declared by the Court, that
I “intended to aid in deterring the plaintiff from
the prosecution of his rights in a court of justice,
either by the terror of calumny, or creating an in-
fluence adverse to his recovery of damages.” I
solemnly asseverate, that I had no intention of this
kind—no thought like this ever entered into my
mind. On the contrary, I was honest in avowing
my disbelief of the charge made by the Courier and
Enquirer. I did not desire to propagate the libel,
if libel it were, but I desired to contradict it.
   The brief paragraph, which was cited in Mr.
Cooper's declaration, was prepared in great haste
and without any reflection, and to supply a deficien-
cy of “matter” for the Evening Signal, a daily
newspaper which I then edited. It was after-
wards inserted in the New World, which was then,
to use a printer's expression, “made up” of the con-
tents of the Evening Signal.
   I ask the further privilege, in conclusion, of dis-
avowing any personal hostility to Mr. Cooper. I
have not the honor of knowing, and cannot say
that I ever saw the gentleman. I have been from
my boyhood the admirer of his early novels, and I
can now heartily thank him for the pleasure which
I derived from them. The sole, existing cause of
the severe comments which I have made on him
and his late works, was his own libellous animad-
versions on American and Americans; his constant
ridicule of our national institutions, national cus-
toms, and national manners; his unrepressed sneers
at our styles of living and our very social enjoy-
ments. Nevertheless, a jury of my countrymen
have, under a direction of the court, given a ver-
dict against me; and I can now only look to public
opinion for that justice which has been <u title="deemed ?">deen</u> de-
nied by the law.
		I am, respectfully,
			Your obedient servant,
					PARK BENJAMIN.

   E<small>SCAPING FROM THE</small> S<small>TATE</small> P<small>RISON IN A</small> B<small>OX</small>.—
A notoriously hardened offender, named James C.
Cole, who had previously served out one term of
imprisonment, was sentenced on the 3d of August,
1840, to fifteen years hard labor in the State Pri-
son at Sing-Sing, for robbery in the first degree,
commonly called highway robbery,—in presenting
a heavily loaded pistol to the breast of a broker in
Greenwich street, saying “your money or your
life.” During the last week Cole, who followed
the box-making business, contrived a plan of escape
in one of the boxes, and accordingly planed off and
prepared a sugar box, driving nails in the cover
and breaking off their points, securing it by wood-
en buttons on the inside, to turn into small gutters,
and thus prevent its coming off when handled, and
directed it to <u title="Maybe Abraham Larue, grocer, 49 Rutgers (Longworth's Almanac, 1839, 1840)">A. Larue</u>, corner of <u title="Pike (elsewhere)">Rutgers</u> and Ma-
dison streets.
   After dinner on Friday, having engaged two
convicts to carry the box to the sloop Fanny, he
got into it and was carried to the wharf, where the
carriers by mistake placed the box on the wrong
end, causing him to rest upon his head for full half
an hour before he was conveyed on board the sloop,
which then set sail with Mr. Lent, one of the
keepers, as passenger, on board. After getting
some miles, one of the sails was carried away by a
squall, and the sloop put back to Sing-Sing to refit,
where the keeper left her, and after repairing da-
mage the sloop again went on her voyage. As the
box in which Cole lay was supposed to contain
valuables, it was placed in the cabin, by the side
of a well heated stove, which rendered the interior
atmosphere so hot that Cole could scarcely breathe.
In this confined condition, nearly roasted alive, and
suffering the torments of thirst, he twice fainted,
and was near dying of heat and suffocation, without
the possibility of relief.
   In the interim, the escape of Cole was disco-
vered and communicated to Lent, the keeper, who
took the first steamer for this city, and arrived here
on Saturday morning, before the sloop, which was
boarded as soon as it touched the wharf. The cover
was soon knocked off the box, and there laid Cole,
packed in, all cramped and crooked up, and nearly
dead from the effects of thirst, fasting, and confine-
ment for eighteen hours. He was hauled out of
the box, unable to stand, and conveyed to the City
Prison, and during the afternoon of Saturday was
reconducted to the Sing Sing prison, to receive a
severe castigation, and complete, if he survive, his
long term of imprisonment.—<i>Express</i>.

   S<small>UICIDE OF THE</small> L<small>OVER OF</small> M<small>ARY</small> R<small>OGERS</small>.—Dan-
iel Payne, the lover of Mary Rogers, was found dead
recently at Hoboken, near the spot where the body
of that unfortunate girl was discovered, under cir-
cumstances that warrant the belief that he commit-
ted suicide. Payne called at the <u>Phenix</u> Hotel, Ho-
boken, on Thursday afternoon. His appearance
was singular and attracted much attention. He
had no hat on, and asked a gentleman present to
loan him one. He eventually obtained a hat, and
as he was going away, he remarked, “Perhaps you
don't know who I am.—I am Payne, the lover of
Mary Rogers. No one knows my troubles.”
   He then left, and no knowledge was had of his
movements, until he was found dead. Nothing
important was found upon his body.

   P<small>LEA OF</small> I<small>NSANITY</small>.—The St. Louis Pennant,
on the authority of a brother of John C. Colt, re-
siding in that city, advances the plea of insanity
in behalf of the supposed murderer of Mr. Adams.
Mr. Colt, who is a member of the St. Louis bar,
informs the Pennant that insanity is hereditary in
their family, and that he has not doubt his broth-
er was insane when he committed the dreadful
act with which he stands charged. He further
states that John has several times suddenly be-
come insane, generally after a period of intense
application to study or to severe mental exercise.
On such occasions, he has usually manifested a
strong desire to commit suicide, and his shrewd
contrivances for that purpose have been frustra-
ted only at the last moment. One member of
the family—a sister—being afflicted in like man-
ner, made several unsuccessful attempts to de-
stroy herself, until, at length, (in 1827) she suc-
ceeded in procuring and swallowing a dose of ar-
senic from the effects of which she died. During
her insanity she manifested the utmost caution
and sagacity, and, in order to procure the arse-
nic without suspicion, she wrote in a disguised
masculine hand in the order for it in Latin, as if
it were a prescription from a physician. All this
may be very true; but still it does not make out
what was evidently the <u title="frenzy">phrenzy</u> of ungovernable
passion the paroxysm of a maniac. The distinc-
tion between these two influences is not always
so distinctly marked by juries, or the public, as
it should be.

   T<small>HE</small> S<small>ELF-MARRYING</small> D<small>UTCH PREACHER</small>.—
Henry Hohnholz was put on trial in Boston on
Friday, for illicit cohabitation with Regina <u>Heil-
nisch</u>, a German girl—a state prison offence.—
Hohnholz, when arraigned last week, represented
himself to be a missionary sent over to this coun-
try from the kingdom of Hanover, and also that
he is at present a member of the synod of the
German Reformed order of Protestants in Ohio.
The testimony against him was conclusive.
   Regina testified, through the medium of an in-
terpreter, that she met the prisoner in Washington
street about a week before she went to Mr.
Frost's; that he accosted her as a countrywoman,
and, after some conversation, proposed to get her
a good place in a family in which she could learn
the English language, and housewifery, as under-
stood among the Yankees. She gladly accepted
his kind offer, and went to Mr. Frost's according-
ly, on the following Wednesday. On Wednes-
day night, he called her into his chamber, and
prayed with her. He then asked her to marry
him, and said that he could read the service to
her, and did so. He told her she had nothing to
fear on account of the form of the marriage; that
he was a good man, and would make her fortune,
and that she should not have a common man for a
husband. The next day he took her down to Sa-
lem, and at a hotel there renewed his assevera-
tions—satisfied her that her own consent was all
that was necessary to make the marriage valid,
without the presence of any other minister. They
then joined hands and vowed eternal constancy
to each other. She believed that by this ceremo-
ny she was lawfully united to him in the bonds
of wedlock, and the marriage was fully consum-
mated there. They returned to Mr. Frost's the
next day, and lived there as man and wife till
Sunday. After his counsel had closed his argu-
ment in his defence, Hohnholz essayed to soften
the hearts of the jury by his own sweet voice, and
said—“Dis here be all von plan—trick—shame to
tak away mine own sweet yeweel—mine vife, as
is mine by all de law of God.”
   His speech, however, was soon cut short by the
Judge, and in a few minutes the jury returned a
verdict of “guilty,” and no mistake.

of Mrs. Adams, are true. Two days before her hus-

murdered, and that she saw his body cut into pieces

   Daniel Payne, the lover of Mary Rogers,
was found dead on Friday 8th inst., at Hoboken,
near where the body of the unfortunate girl was
found, under circumstances which induce the
belief that he committed suicide.
   The jury of inquest reported that he died of
congestion of the brain.

		<b>Colt, the Murderer.</b>
   A correspondent of the Boston Atlas says:
   “I have learnt that Colt, the murderer of
Adams, the printer, whose trial comes on short-
ly in New York, was formerly a student of the
University of Vermont at Burlington. In 1830
or 1831, he studied the course of mathematics,
and was quite a proficient in that branch of ed-
ucation. He was a very quiet, gentlemanly
fellow—represented himself as an heir to a
large fortune, to be left to him by his grandfa-
ther, who resided at Hartford, Conn. While
at College, he was very much esteemed by his
classmates, and was a young gentleman gene-
rally supposed to be of a very amiable disposi-
tion. During one of the vacations, he travelled
to Detroit, Green Bay, and to other places in
the West, and gathered many and various In-
dian curiosities, which he presented to the Mu-
seum of the University on his return to Burling-
ton. The writer of this remembers the dog
harness “presented by J. Caldwell Colt, of
Hartford,” and other curiosities presented by
him. These facts are unimportant to many,
but to a few this gossipry may not be entirely
devoid of interest.”

   B<small>URIED</small> A<small>LIVE</small>—A<small>LMOST, NOT
QUITE</small>.—The New Orleans Picayune
says—A scene strange as any found-
ed on fiction occurred in this city on
Sunday last. We will give it in the
words of the gentleman who furnish-
ed us with the fact. His veracity
and its truth may be relied on.
   It appears that a young Spaniard
was lying in the last stages of yellow
fever, next door to the printing office
of Mr. G., in Chartres street. The
physician, Dr. B., was sent for, but
before his arrival, the young man had
ceased to live, according to the opin-
ions of those in the house, so that
when he arrived he found his patient
covered with a white linen, and re-
ported as dead. That very evening
they washed and cleansed the young
man, and having put on his burial
dress, they laid him on his bed until
the morning. In the morning a coffin
was got, and all the necessary prepar-
ations were made. He was then ta-
ken and put <u title="in (elsewhere)">into</u> his coffin, but no soon-
er was he dropped in it than he jumped
up and asked where they were going
to place him. They then conducted
him in a carriage to a colored nurse-
woman's house. He is yet very sick,
but may perhaps live. It appears that
he was in a state of lethargy.

<d>[Col.4]</d>
		<b>From Boston Times.</b>
   C<small>OLT, THE</small> U<small>NFORTUNATE</small>.—It has been our lot
to be acquainted with this young man for several
years, and when we first read the awful intelligence
of his killing Mr. Adams, we set it down as entirely
unworthy of credit. But, alas! it is too true. This
circumstance awakens our memory to the train of
his acquaintance, and leads us on to some reflections.
   Our first knowledge of J. C. Colt was at Cincin-
nati, some four or five years ago. He was at that
time engaged in teaching the science of Accounts,
and preparing a work on this subject for the press,
which has since appeared; and, we must say, giving
him justice for his labors, on a comparison of his
work with that of similar publications, he has
evinced in his production, in point of genius,
originality and talent, a degree of superiority,
which places him beyond all cavil far in the van of
his cotemporaries.
   In Cincinnati, Colt's acquaintances were con-
fined almost exclusively to his pupils, who held
him in high esteem, and few persons that he had
business with from time to time. His general de-
portment was tacit and reserved, which was at-
tributed to his peculiar circumstances; as with
those whom business had caused an acquaintance,
he was not only communicative but instructive—
bland, affable, mild, gentlemanly—it was all the
same to him, whether in converse with the lord of
the soil or the beggar in the street. Among those who
knew him it was often spoken of as surprising that
he should be engaged in teaching, as he was evi-
dently qualified, both by nature and education, to
fill a much more distinguished rank in society.
This, we feel confident in saying, is the general
character and estimate in which young Colt was
held, not only in Cincinnati, but Louisville, Mays-
ville, and the other cities of the West, where he
was known as a teacher.
   Although eminently successful as an accountant,
Mr. Colt has met several reverses of fortune within
the last three years, that has led many of his friends
to think, from an apparent change of countenance,
that these casualties were undermining his consti-
tution, and that to this he would soon yield. If
this be true, how far a broken spirit may have had
a tendency to make him irritable, and produce the
unfortunate result between himself and Mr. Adams,
we are unable to say. But this is not our opinion.
From our knowledge of Mr. Colt, we should have
taken him to be one of those who would bear
with fortitude any of the ordinary reverses of life.
He has but just passed that period in manhood
when the rose on the cheek, and the laughing eye,
change places for the grave, reflective, meditating
cast which envelope the countenances of persons
like Mr. Colt, whose habits have been sedentary
and given to study.
   It was our intention when we commenced this
article to have spoken of some of Mr. Colt's mis-
fortunes, but as we have already drawn it out be-
yond our prescribed limits, we omit doing so for
the present. We have only to add that, we hope
he may be able to bear up with Christian fortitude—
that Christianity he professed when a youth—in
passing the ordeal of his trial, and resign with that
manliness to his fate, whatever that fate may be,
which has characterized his life; as we have it in
his own words, beautifully applied to Goddard the
Accountant, “a life of reverses, miscarryings and
misfortunes.”

STREET</small> P<small>APER</small> G<small>ONE</small>.—Last evening the “Evening
Star,” established by M. M. Noah, went the way
of all flesh—gave up the ghost and took refuge in
the big bowels of Col. Stone of the “Commercial
Advertiser.”
   The fate of that wicked, unprincipled, demoral-
ized organ of a demoralized <i>clique</i> we have always
predicted. The “Star” was the first paper which,
under the auspices and editorship of Noah, began
the “moral war” upon the New York Herald, for
which that man will yet be punished as he richly de-
serves. The paper was always a miserable, rickety
concern, for the man who started it had as much ta-
lent to manage such a business with energy and de-
cision, as he has to sit in a Court of Justice and give
decisions on pork law. The marvel is that it had
such a protracted existence. It has taken refuge in
Col. Stone's capacious bowels, but we should not
be surprised if it were to act as a dose of prussic acid
upon that philosopher, and make him rue the day he
swallowed such a bit of steak.
   Thus goes out the light of the Wall street press—
one after one—like the flickerings of so many de-
caying lamps, without oil or wick. The whole
class of these newspapers are destined to meet the
same fate. Since we began the Herald, hardly six
years yet, we have seen five or six Wall street
prints die off, and in the next six years we expect
to see all the other follow.

owing probably to complete exhaustion of health,
that little expectation need be entertained in that

   The daily evening journal, called the <i>Times and
Evening Star</i>, has ceased, for the present, to be
published. The Times was first established as a
morning paper by the conservatives; espoused the
political views entertained by N. P. Tallmadge,
and was understood to be the organ of his friends
in this city. After a year or two, it became united
with the Evening Star, and was turned into an
evening paper, the former editor of the Star with-
drawing from its management. When, not long
since, the division took place between the Tyler
whigs and the Clay whigs, it ranged itself, along
with Mr. Tallmadge, on the side of Mr. Clay.
   Its editorial articles were various, both in temper
and ability, indicating a great diversity of parent-
age. Too many of them were stuffed with offen-
sive personalities, owing, probably, to the want of
a firm and practised hand at the helm. The lead-
ing article in last evening's <i>Times and Star</i>, says
that the paper is suspended only; that, for the
present, its subscribers are to receive the Commer-
cial in its stead; and that it is hoped its publica-
tion will be resumed under “editors of well-
known experience and reputation.” If the paper
should be revived, we wish it, in all good will,
an improvement in its manners.

			<b>No More.</b>
			  ——
		<small>BY HENRY <u title="CUDDEN (elsewhere)">M'CUDDEN</u>.</small>
			  ——
<m9>   'No More' is one of those brief phrases in which
a volume of meaning and sentiment is concentrat-
ed; excepting the word 'farewell!' there are, per-
haps, no two syllables in the English language
which say so much.
	What heart but feels a painful sting
	Whene'er these little words are said?
	They tell of some departed thing,
	Of pleasures from us ever fled;
	They wake a sense of loneliness,
	Of loss which naught can e'er restore;
	What other words so much express
	As these short ones, 'No More?'

	In childhood's sunny, sportive time,
	With thoughts but for the present hour,
	We sometimes sigh for manhood's prime,
	For vast possessions, wealth, and power;
	And these obtained, what do they bring?
	Cares which the heart make sick and sore,
	From which remembrance turns to cling
	Round that dear time, 'No More!'

	They who have watch'd a parent's bed,
	When racking pain its pillow press'd
	E'er from them and the world had fled
	The spirit to the realms of rest,
	How earnestly they've gazed upon
	The features which death's impress bore;
	Then answered each inquiring one,
	'Alas! she is 'No More!'

	The friends whom trial prov'd most true,
	The fast and warm, who knew not change,
	'Mongst many false, a faithful few
	Whose staunch regards nought could estrange,
	What must we feel when destiny
	Bids them depart for some far shore,
	With something whispering us that we
	Shall meet them here 'No More!'

	They who have lov'd in <u title="early (elsewhere)">earthly</u> youth,
	When all the soul felt love's pure flame,
	<u title="Ere (elsewhere)">E'er</u> aught had power to <u title="taint (elsewhere)">taunt</u> its truth,
	Or blight had o'er the fair flower came,
	They know the sadness of these words,
	If harsh fate hath in sunder tore
	Their young <u title="affections' (elsewhere)">affection's</u> finer chords
	To re-unite 'No More!'

	The emigrant, on that sad day,
	He bids adieu to each loved scene
	Where he in boyhood used to play,—
	His valleys and his hills of green,
	The parting grasp of every hand,
	<u title="Ere (elsewhere)">E'er</u> he shall cross the salt wave o'er,
	How well may he not understand
	The meaning of 'No More!'

	That outcast wretch, the lorn exile,
	Whose days and nights are spent in sighs
	For home and for its kindly smile,
	Yet, knows these ne'er shall greet his eyes,
	He thinks of that bright peerless form
	Whom 'twas his pride once to adore,—
	That cherished one, 'mid calm and storm,
	He must embrace 'No More!'

	The soldier, on the tented plain,
	<u title="Keeps silent (elsewhere)">Keep's lent</u> watch, till morning's light
	Shall rouse his comrades up again
	To bare their blades for bloody fight,—
	His spirit feels a presage dread
	That chills his brave heart's inmost core,
	The morrow finds him 'mong the dead,
	<u title="He'll (elsewhere)">He'd</u> lead the charge 'No More!'

	The toil-worn seaman, homeward bound,
	At times in dreary fancy sees
	His little ones all gathering round,
	Eager to climb their father's knees,—
	Of home and all its joy he thinks,
	When the black tempest's sudden roar
	Bursts o'ver his barque, he struggles, sinks
	To rise in life 'No More!'
		*    *    *    *    *    *    *
	The history of all the past,
	Downward from Time's remotest age,
	Present and future, must, at last,
	Yield them to figure in its page;
	Brief though it seem, its ample time
	Will not be wholly fill'd before
	The angel's trump <u title="rends (elsewhere)">sends</u> earth's vast dome,

   <i>John C. Colt</i>.—The trial of this individual for the
murder of Mr. Samuel Adams, is set down positively
for this day week, in the Court of Oyer and Terminer,
before Judge Kent, and will doubtless cause much
and very just excitement throughout the community.
We are informed that he does not suffer from mental
agony and terrors of conscience in so great a degree
as has been represented, and that beyond the pale-
ness and languor incident to a confinement in prison,
upon fare not of the most dainty description, his ap-
pearance has undergone very little change. No per-
sons are allowed to visit him except his two brothers,
who have arrived in this city, and his counsel, and
with them, as indeed with the keepers, he is very
talkative, but not upon the subject of the murder for
which he stands committed.

   T<small>RIAL OF</small> H<small>ARDENBURGH</small>—P<small>LEA OF</small> I<small>NSANITY</small>.—
It will be seen by our report that Hardenburgh has
been found guilty, by a jury of Monticello, of the
murder of Hasbrouck. The close of his trial is
deeply interesting, particularly in reference to the
plea of insanity, set up by the counsel for the pri-
soner. It has been the fashion of late years to im-
pute all murders to insanity. This is very like the
notion of the Rev.Doctor Potts, of Duane street,
and the Rev. Col. Stone of every where, in imput-
ing all the crimes, defalcations, &c., of the age, to
Extra Heralds and Extra Suns. On this point the
charge of Judge Ruggles is very opportune. There
are capital cases now pending in our courts, in which
the same defence will be set, with what success time
will tell.

   J<small>USTICE</small> P<small>ARKER AGAIN—MORE BUSINESS FOR THE</small>
C<small>OUNTY</small> C<small>OURT</small>.—What with the <u title="pusillanimous">pusilanimous</u> efforts
of the Board of Assistants, and the Grand Jury, to
hunt down the Sunday News Boys—The Indictment
at the instance of one of the Indefatigables against a
Sunday paper—The Impeachment of Magistrates,
for mal-practices, the star chamber and stool pi-
geon systems, and all that sort of thing taken into
view, it appears that we have a very pretty and in-
teresting state of things in prospective.
   Some time in the month of August last, a very
gentlemanly individual, named Henry S. Pearson,
who officiated as ticket receiver at one of the
theatres, was assaulted, while in the discharge of
his duty, by a rowdy soaplock, one of the “forty
thieves” gang, named Henry Bouton, when the
life of Mr. Pearson was endangered, and his bodily
injuries very severe.
   Mr. Pearson went before the Grand Jury, and
succeeded in obtaining a bill of indictment against
Bouton. A bench warrant was issued, and bail re-
quired, in $1000, to hold the offender for trial. On
the 20th instant, officer Fisby, to whom the warrant
was entrusted, transferred his power to an officer
named Parker, and the latter succeeded in getting
the rowdy in his clutches. Parker, Fisby, Bouton,
and one John Willis then proceeded—not to the
Tombs, as was their bounden duty—but to the resi-
dence of Justice <u>Milne</u> Parker, in Elm street.
Here a brief conflab was held, and the result was
that the prisoner was permitted to go on the word
of Willis until the next morning, when he was to
come up and surrender. Next morning came, but,
as might be expected, no prisoner came. Upon
proper inquiry being instituted, it was found that
Bouton had embarked, and is now on the “deep,
deep sea,” on the way to New Orleans.
   The complainant in this case, determining not to be
foiled, went yesterday before the Mayor to make a
complaint against Justice Parker, who was called
up, and pleaded, in justification for his conduct,
“that he thought the accused was a pretty clever
fellow; that he had often taken Mr. Willis' word,
and all had been right.” The Justice was informed
by the Mayor that his act was a highly penal one,
that it was a contempt of a higher court, and for
which he ought to respond in a criminal suit.
Here the matter rested with the Mayor. Not so
with the complainant; he's a man of too much
mettle to suffer the affair to rest here. Legal ad-
vice was resorted to, and the necessary affidavits
were made, and the preliminary steps taken to
bring the matter, in a proper form, before the
County Court. The articles and specifications will
probably be preferred, and presented to the Com-
mon Pleas Judges during the present week.

Here was the aggravation of the case. It consti-

		<i>For the Evening Post.</i>
   Mr. Editor.—The sole object of my communica-
tion, in relation to the libel suit against Mr. Park
Benjamin, being a statement of the <i>facts</i>, I trust
you will allow me to correct two essential errors
into which he has fallen in his answer:
<l9>   Mr. Benjamin <s>reasons as</s> if all the libellous mat-
ter in his publication, was contained in his extract
from the Courier and Enquirer. This opinion is
opposed to that of the Supreme Court, the latter
distinctly pointing out libellous imputations in that
portion of the article that <i>was editorial</i>, as well as
in that which was <i>extracted</i>. It lays quite as much,
if not greater stress, on the first, than on the last.
Mr. Benjamin says it was his desire to contradict
the libel of the Courier and Enquirer, if libel it was,
and the Supreme Court, in effort, says—if we allow
Mr. Benjamin's statement to be true—that he libel-
led me in his attempt to vindicate me! I confess
that I am of the same way of thinking.
   Again:—Mr. Benjamin says, that in commenting
on the amount of the verdict, his intention was
merely to show the difference between my estimate
of the wrong done me, and the estimate of the jury;
the first being $10,000, and the last only $375.
Now, any one who knows anything of practice,
will understand that the amount of damages set
forth in a declaration is never exactly graduated by
an estimate of the pecuniary injury done the plain-
tiff, on the one hand; while, on the other, except
in cases in which <i>special damages</i> are laid in the
declaration, and proved on the trial, the jury take
into consideration the ability of the defendant to
pay, as well as any mitigating circumstances that
may offer, in making up their verdict. In this case,
no special damages were alleged, and no testimony
in aggravation was offered, and it was doubtless a
strong mitigating circumstance that the defendant
did not attempt any other mode of defence, <i>even in
his argument</i>, than an effort to show the trivial
nature of the injury. So much for the principles;
as to the fact, it remains only to say, that Mr. Ben-
jamin, in making out his statement, has just <i>doubled</i>
the amount of damages laid in my declaration; the
sum having been $5,000, and not $10,000, as is
proved by the accompanying letter.
	Yours, respectfully,
			J. FENIMORE COOPER.
   Dear Sir:—The statement in Mr. Park Benja-
min's letter in the Evening Post, wherein he alleges
that the damages laid in your suit against him, were
$10,000, is inaccurate; Mr. Benjamin having
doubled the amount. He also leaves a false
inference when he says “the portion of the
paragraph in my paper, construed to be libel-
lous, was extracted from the Courier and En-
quirer.” The Court distinctly decided that the
editorial comments accompanying this extract,
were also libellous.

   A<small>N</small> A<small>DVENTURE IN THE</small> A<small>IR</small>.—A perilous ad-
venture in the air with a Balloon, was made at St.
Louis, by Mr. S. Hobart and Miss Day, on the 9th
inst. After going up about two miles, he found by
the slow, rotary turn the balloon assumed, that she
was wearing into another current, and that that
current would take them over the Mississippi. On
applying himself to the valve cord, he found it
bound in the neck of the balloon, which hung in
folds, pressing on the small hoop over head, and en-
tirely out of reach. In a letter written at 8 o'clock
in the evening, Mr. H. gives this account of his
escape from this perilous dilemma:
   “What was to be done? If the valve was forc-
ed open by pulling the cord with main strength,
there was no possibility that its springs would be
sufficient to close it again, and there remained but
the other alternative of riding out the moonless
night, and leaving to the Balloon the time and
place of descent. In this dilemma an expedient
presented itself, one that nothing but the emergen-
cy of the case could have induced me to try, that
of ascending by the cords to the hoop over my
head; seated on which, I might perhaps remove
the difficulty. Seating my little charge in the cen-
tre of the car, with a strict injunction not to rise, I
proceeded to what I considered pretty “tall climb-
ing.” With the utmost effort of my strength, I suc-
ceeded in gaining the hoop, and, resting myself up-
on it, introduced my head and shoulders into the
neck of the Balloon, disentangled the valve cord,
looking up through it to the valve, found all right;
then letting myself down the cords into the car, I
found that the little adventurer with me had been
asleep—affected as <u title="AEronauts">Æronauts</u> used to be, at a great
altitude, with drowsiness. The valve operating
well, I descended slowly, and soon distinctly heard
the tramp of horses, and concluded to land.
   “I then rose to an altitude of probably more
than two miles, and, after enjoying with my com-
panion awhile the landscape below, comprising a
view of St. Louis, Alton, St. Charles, and the Mis-
sissippi and Missouri far beyond them, I descended
at this place without the slightest injury.”

	“<i>The Cup of His Sorrow is Full</i>.”
   A life of contant struggles and adversity seems
to prepare some men to tread in the path of sor-
row and of suffering, and still bear up with
Christian fortitude to a degree that seems in-
comprehensible to the experience and under-
standing of most.
   The subject of this article, John C. Colt, is
one of the most extraordinary cases of this kind
we have ever known. While all about him trem-
ble at the enormity of the crime of homicide, he,
the accused, coolly bears the charge, and un-
flinchingly hears that testimony which bears hea-
vily with him. His personal appearance is quite
prepossessing—no one would suppose him a cul-
prit. He looks like one who has spent a life of
rectitude, and of virtue. A devious and unfortu-
nate course has, in part, without doubt, prepared
him for this affliction. Still he has a firmer re-
liance than this world's worthlessness. Young
Colt was, in youth, a devout Christian. He has
now the most sublime and correct notions of the
Deity. And although he has fallen into the pit of
death, the God of the unfortunate will protect him.
   We say to all be on the watch, for ye know not
how soon the hour of trouble cometh.
   The day of trial will be a day of relief to young
Colt. Things not now generally known will be
then elicited, and greatly to his favor.

   A<small>DMINISTRATION OF</small> J<small>USTICE</small>—T<small>RIAL OF</small> C<small>OLT</small>.—
We are informed that the trial of John C. Colt, for
the murder of Mr. Adams, which was set down for
Monday next, is to be put off for a more convenient
period, or until the excitement created by the bloody
deed shall have died away. It is supposed by his
counsel and his friends that he cannot have a fair
trial, under the present state of public feeling—and
accordingly great influence has been exercised to
postpone the trial, as we are informed.
   This is a very curious affair—and the articles on
the subject which have recently appeared in certain
public prints, are equally curious and mysterious. A
short time ago, publications were made in Boston
and St. Louis, palliating the crime and making
statements which were republished here. In one of
them, it was stated that a brother of Colt's imputed
the act to insanity, he asserting also, under a strange
species of personal forgetfulness, that insanity was
hereditary in the family. We find also in the “Tri-
bune” of yesterday the following strange article:—
		“<i>The cup of his sorrow is full</i>.”
	<a class="l" href="#Tribune-1841-10-28-Col5">...</a>
   We have had no desire to say a word to affect this
awful case, nor have we uttered a word till now.
We have a personal acquaintance with some of the
family connexions of the accused; but as the con-
ductor of a free and moral press, bound to support
the prompt administration of the laws as the only
sheet anchor of society, we must characterise this
effusion in the “Tribune” as the most impudent,
atrocious, audacious, and demoralizing paragraph
that ever appeared in any newspaper within the me-
mory of man. Look at the utter profanity and
blasphemy of these sentiments. If a poor devil of a
loafer steals three pounds of pork, or knocks down
his neighbor, or pilfers a pair of breeches, to cover
his nakedness, he is tried, convicted, and punished,
with railroad speed, and as a matter of course. But
when a person of respectable connexions, as they
are called, robs a bank of thousands, cheats the
public out of tens of thousands, or sends a fellow
creature into eternity at a blow, he is to be held up
as a hero—he looks like one “who has lived a life
of virtue”—“he has the most sublime and correct
notions of the Deity”—his trial is to be postponed,
in order to avoid newspaper excitement, and every
effort is publicly and privately made, to nullify the
laws and to render inoperative the administration of
prompt justice.
   This is the very same demoralized feeling, the
very same unjust effort, which, in the case of Rich-
ard P. Robinson and of the various other murderers
who have escaped, that have made the administra-
tion of justice a word of reproach—and have in-
creased the fearful amount of crime that all are now
deploring. Look at the history of our Criminal
Courts and Criminal Judges during the last few
years, beginning with the fatal day when misguided
and mistaken efforts, set on foot by Joseph Hoxie,
effected the escape of the “Great Unhung.” Mur-
derer on murderer—rogue on rogue—cheat on cheat
—forger on forger have escaped, principally because
they belonged to respectable society, and were as-
sisted by the “respectable portion of the press.” At
this very moment, by the supineness, or something
worse, of the Court of Sessions, we see such crimi-
nals as Mitchell, the member of Congress, postpon-
ing his trial, till it gets out of the public mind—and
then he will get clear. Redfield, the late cashier of
the Commercial Bank, whose crimes were known to
Chandler Starr and the Bank Commissioners, was
also permitted to escape, without arrest or process
till it was too late to catch him. Yet in the midst of
this strange demoralization of justice, affecting
highly respectable criminals, we see the Court of
Sessions, Judge Noah presiding, sentencing week-
ly whole batches of loafers to the State Prison and
Penitentiary, without a tear of regret, or a para-
graph of sympathy. Out upon such a system of
equal and exact justice!

   C<small>OLT'S</small> S<small>TATEMENT</small>.—We learn that Colt suffers
little, comparatively little mental agony, and the
terrors of conscience affect him little if any. His
brother, a lawyer of St. Louis, is here, and he, to-
gether with the one residing in this city, are the
only persons permitted to visit him, except his
counsel. To all he is said to be very communica-
tive, except on the subject of the murder.
   His own statement of this dreadful affair he has
not been permitted to make on his public examina-
tions; whether wisely or not, we do not pretend to
say. Such a statement has, however, been made
to his friends, repeated to us, and we give it as we
received it, without comment.
   He states that Adams came to his rooms on the
fatal afternoon to dun him for an unsettled account,
about which there was some dispute. They both
sat down at the table and settled the various items
except $3. About this a dispute arose between
them, and high words ensued, during which Adams
called him “a liar.” Exasperated at this he struck
him, and a scuffle thereupon ensued. Adams be-
ing the stronger man of the two, threw and fell up-
on Colt, and clutched him so violently by the throat
that he was in danger of choking. Colt was then
lying upon his back on the floor, and as his hand
was stretched out, it came in contact with some-
thing which he at once seized, (but as he avers he
knew not what it was) and finding Adams's grip
still hard upon his throat, he brought his hand
round and struck him on the back of the head; this
it would seem was hardly sufficient to stun him,
and he only rolled rather more on one side; Colt then
struck him again, and the blow must have fallen
on the other side of the head. These wounds,
dreadful as the subsequent examination proved
them to be, were not sufficient to release the pris-
oner's throat; but even in the agony of death,
Adams still continued to hold firmly on, until Colt
seemed to be at his last gasp, and then the dreadful
blow was given on the front of the head, which de-
prived the wretched being of life, and released the
other from his grasp. Colt then arose, and found
Adams a corpse.
   For some time, he says, he remained stupified
with dread and horror—he knew not what to do,
and at length determined to make his brother ac-
quainted with the facts; for this purpose he went
to his lodgings, but he was not at home. He then
went into the Park, and walked there for some
time, being unable to make up his mind as to the
best course to be pursued—he at one time thought
to tell some friend, but knowing that some stains
rested upon his character, he refrained lest they
should not believe his story, and so deliver him up
to justice. After travelling the Park for many and
many a time, he at length returned to his rooms,
and took the dreadful means, with which the
public are already acquainted, to conceal the aw-
ful deed.
   We offer no remarks on the above statement, but
simply give it, as given to us. The story is a very
plausible, and a very probable one; the wounds
on the head of the deceased, might well have been
given in the manner described. There are, how-
ever, no witnesses of the dreadful tragedy—to God
and to himself the secret alone is known.—<i>Express</i>.

   C<small>OLT'S</small> S<small>TORY</small>.—A publication appeared in the
Express of yesterday morning, which is given as
Colt's narration of the circumstances which led to
and resulted in the death, at his hands, of Mr.
Adams. It may be his story, and it may not. If
it is, it fully does away with the plea of insanity
urged in his behalf, and reduces the murder to
manslaughter of a very inferior degree, if not to
justifiable homicide. If it is not what it purport
to be, its publication is very improper and repre-
hensible. If it is a <i>bona fide</i> statement of the
wretched prisoner, why has it been kept from the
public so long. Whatever may be its character,
public curiosity requires for its place in our co-
lumns, though, under the circumstances, we most
unwillingly accord it. It is as follows:
<l9>   We learn that Colt suffers little, comparatively
little mental agony. His brother, a lawyer of St.

ing in this city, are the only persons permitted to

communication from a friend of this unhappy man,
with an express dissent from its inculcations.—
Having published much directly calculated to in-
flame the public mind to frenzy against him—we
fear to justly—we did not think it just to shut
out from our readers what his friends had to offer
in his behalf. Were we wrong in this? Consider
that the wretched man is soon to take his trial for
Murder, under circumstances bearing very hardly
upon him. And shall he be convicted upon the
<i>testimony</i> adduced on trial, or on previous <i>im-
pressions</i> against him?—We hope it will be on the
testimony alone; and though the <i>Herald</i> has
meanly and falsely assailed us for the former arti-
cle, suppressing the fact that it was a communica-
tion, and our comments thereon—we shall not hes-
itate to copy from Friday's Express Colt's version

in families scattered over the empire, principally
in the winter season, when there must be cessa-
tion of out-door employment. Some families ma-
nufacture but one or two pieces in a season, others
twenty or thirty. The quality does not material-
ly differ. They are carried to the nearest popu-
lous town, and sold to a trader, who packs them
in bales, and transports them to St. Petersburgh,
or some other seaport, where they are again sold
for exportation.

   In the Court of Oyer and Terminer, on Saturday,
J. A. Morrill, Esq. one of the counsel for J. C. Colt,
indicted for the murder of Samuel Adams, moved for
the postponement of the trial, on the ground of the
absence of a material witness, but Judge Kent re-
minded him, that as Monday (this day) was set apart
for that trial, it would be time enough then to make
the application. It will of course be made this day,
and will be doubtless very strongly opposed by the
District Attorney.
   In the Court of Sessions the trial of the Ex-Hon.
C. F. Mitchell, is set down for Friday positively, and
the trial of William Wiley, Esq. will come on during
same term.

<d>[Col.6]</d>
	COURT OF OYER AND TERMINER.
			Before Judge K<small>ENT</small>.
		TRIAL OF JOHN C. COLT.
   At an early hour this morning, the Court room
was thronged with citizens anxious to catch a view
the noted individual, whose trial for the murder of
Mr. Samuel Adams was set down for this day. The
appearance of the prisoner was certainly not that of
the haggard, conscience-stricken man—on the con-
tratry he seemed to have suffered no more than would
be natural from the confinement in a prison cell, on
prison diet; yet there was an uneasy contraction of
the brow, and restless movement of the features gen-
erally. He was dressed very <u title="genteelly">genteely</u>, in black, and
has the air of a gentleman.
<l9>	...
   The necessary papers having arrived, Mr. Selden
proceeded to read the—first, an affidavit, of the
counsel as to the absence of Caroline M. Henshaw,
a material witness for the defence, without whose
testimony it would be unsafe to proceed to trial—
next, a certificate of Dr. <u>M'Collom</u> of Philadelphia,
that she was in such a situation as precluded the pos-
sibility of her appearance here at present, on account
of her being <u title="enceinte"><i>enciente</i></u>—next, an affidavit of Miss Hen-
shaw to the same effect, and upon these papers Mr.
Selden moved that the trial go off for the present
Oyer and Terminer. Mr. Selden said it was not ne-
cessary, after reading these papers, but it would be
obvious that it would be great injustice to the prison-
er, as well as unsafe to him, to proceed without this
witness. At all events, he said little time only had
elapsed since the commission of the deed with which
the prisoner stands charged, and all the previous pro-
ceedings had been carried through with a haste that
could not warrant the charge of delay on the part of
either party.
	...
   Mr. J. Prescott Hall, said that the next term of
the court commence on the fourth Monday in De-
cember next, and he had no doubt that the present
disability of the prisoner would disappear by that
time, and she would be able to appear and give her
testimony orally. But in case she should not be able
to come at the next term, a commission might issue
in which the prosecution might join.
   After some few further remarks from counsel,
Judge Kent remarked, that if an application for a
postponement of a trial is made at the first term of
the court after finding an indictment, it was a matter
of right to the prisoner to grant it, unless it was made
with a colorable design, and a view to unnecessary de-
lay. In the present case, he could not see that there
was any ground for such a supposition. There was no
doubt that the absent witness was very important; on
that point they had, 1st,—the admissions of the Dis-
trict Attorney, and second, the affidavits of eminent
counsel, and the Court could not suppose these gen-
tlemen prompted by any other than good and honor-
able motives. Believing that then, the case must go
off.
	...
   For the prosecution, J. R. Whiting, District Attor-
ney, and James M. Smith, Jr.
   For the prisoner, Messrs. J. Prescott Hall, Dudley
Selden, Robt. <u>Emmett</u>, and J. A. Morrill.</l9>

	COURT OF OYER AND TERMINER.
Before Judge Kent and Aldermen Woodhull and Leonard.
   J. C. C<small>OLT</small>.—Yesterday had been set down for the trial
of Colt, charged with the murder of Samuel Adams, in
September last. The prisoner was brought into Court at
an early hour, and before the doors were thrown open for
the admission of the multitude. He greeted those he met
with much ease and calmness, and seemed very little
changed in appearance from the period of his arraign-
ment. After some little delay, when the Court had
opened, Mr. Selden, one of his counsel, moved that the
trial be postponed, a very material witness for the de-
fence being absent. He then read an affidavit made on
Saturday last from Caroline M. Henshaw, [the young wo-
man with whom Colt resided in Madison street,] stating
that she was at present in Philadelphia, where she be-
longed, that she was in ill health, and expected every day
to be confined, and that it would be impossible for her
without great danger, to come on to New-York. The
affidavit was supported by another corroboratory of its
assertions from a physician at Philadelphia.
   Mr. Selden and Mr. J. Prescott Hall, counsel, in con-
nection with Mr. Morrill and Mr. Emmet, for the prisoner,
urged the importance of having this witness present, and
the utter impossibility of her coming at present to New-
York. After conversation between the Court, the District
Attorney, and counsel, the trial was finally postponed
to the fourth Monday of December next.
   A vast multitude of persons assembled with a view to
see the prisoner and hear the proceedings, thousands of
whom were compelled to go away disappointed, not being
able to obtain admission on account of the throng.

Selden, Robt. <u>Emmett</u>, and J. A. Morrill.
   N. B. The young woman referred to in the above
report, on account of whose absence the trial was
postponed, Caroline M. Henshaw, was the <i>chere amie</i>
of the prisoner, and the materiality of her testimony
may be inferred from the fact, that the watch of the
murdered man was found in her possession.

   C<small>OLT'S</small> T<small>RIAL</small> P<small>OSTPONED</small>.—It will be seen from
our report of the Oyer and Terminer to-day, that ac-
cording to our prediction (no court or cabinet secret
is hidden from us) the trial of Colt is postponed to
the 27th of December next, and when December
comes we suppose it will be postponed again. One
word on Mr. <u title="Selden (elsewhere)">Seldon</u>'s allusion, one of the prisoner's
counsel, to the newspapers. Does Mr. <u>Seldon</u> know
who have been busiest with the newspapers? Cer-
tainly not the public. The prisoner's own friends
have made all the noise and uproar. They have
procured the publication of very reprehensible arti-
cles, palliating the crime, in newspapers throughout
the city and country, and yet Mr. <u>Seldon</u> turn round
and talks about the newspapers. Out upon such
humbug!

<b>The Case of John C. Colt, indicted for the
		Murder of Mr. Adams.</b>
   The Case of Colt, indicted for the murder of
Adams, was set down for trial in the Circuit Court,
before Judge Kent, yesterday; and the knowledge
of this fact drew a large crowd to the Court room as
early as 9 o'clock yesterday morning. The excite-
ment on this particular point, (notwithstanding that
we are just on the eve of a very singular election)
appeared to be most intense; in two minutes after
the doors were opened the large space allotted to
the public outside the bar was completely filled; and
before 10 o'clock there was scarce standing room
inside the railing. All the leading members of the
bar were present, and many other distinguished in-
dividuals—and many persons had come from the
neighboring towns to witness the trial.
   At 10 o'clock precisely Judge Kent and Aldermen
Woodhull and Leonard entered and took their seats
on the bench. The District Attorney, Mr. Whit-
ing, followed soon after. After waiting about two
minutes, Judge Kent said, “Mr. Attorney, are you
ready with any cause?”
<l9>   W<small>HITING</small>—I move to bring on, sir, the case of John
C. Colt. Officer put John C. Colt to the bar.
   Colt, who had been in Court nearly an hour, was
then brought to the end of the long table at which
the reporters sit, and sat down. He appeared more
calm, and less agitated than on any previous occa-
sion; but he was evidently laboring under great
mental excitement, which he strongly endeavored
to suppress. The skin over his cheek bones was suf-
fused with blood, resembling a man of a strong ner-
vous temperament after hard drinking; and his eye,
which is peculiarly deep and penetrating, and has
at times a wild savage look, was incessantly in mo-
tion. Mr. John A. Morrill sat by his side.
   W<small>HITING</small>—Have you any motion to make, Mr.
Morrill?
   J<small>UDGE</small>—Call a jury.
   M<small>ORRILL</small>—My associate counsel I expect here di-
rectly; if the Court please to wait a few minutes be-
fore calling the jury.
   J<small>UDGE</small>—We'll wait a little, sir.
   W<small>HITING</small>—In the mean time, call my witnesses,
to see if they are here. Crier, call the names.
   The crier called the following names:—
			P<small>RESENT</small>,
Judge Taylor,			Hugh Monahan,
Asa H. Wheeler,		<u title="Lowe Hockton (elsewhere)">Low Hocton</u>,
John <u title="Delnoce (elsewhere) ?">Delano</u>,			John Johnson,
Chas. Wells,			Wm. Robinson,
Mrs. Hocton.
			A<small>BSENT</small>,
Mr. Smith,				Robert H. Morris, mayor,
W. L. Coffin, mate,		Caroline M. Henshaw,
John P. Elwell, agent,	David Kelsall,
Mr. Signette,				Miss Charlotte Kelsall,
Chandler <u title="Gilman (elsewhere, Longworth's 1839)">Gillman</u>,		Richard Barstow,
James Kissam,			David <u title="Downs (elsewhere)">Down</u>,
Abner Milliken,			J. R. Chilton,
Thos. Russell,			<u title="Mrs. Emily Adams ?">Miss</u> E. Adams,
Mr. Walker,				Joseph W. Harrison.
   After these names had been called, the Court told
Mr. <u>Morrell</u> he had better go and see after his asso-
ciate counsel in the case. The Court then waited
nearly ten minutes, during which time Dudley Sel-
den came into the room. At last, Judge K<small>ENT</small> said,
“What is the reason of the delay in this case?”
   S<small>ELDEN</small>.—Mr. Robert <u>Emmett</u> is my associate
counsel in this case. The reason of the delay is
this; he thought that he should be able to be here
at the opening of the Court, to swear to an affidavit
which it is necessary counsel should swear to. His
son told me that he could not come this morning,
and I've sent the affidavit up to his house in 8th
street; there has been time enough, and I expect it
here immediately. There is another affidavit which
is connected with it—
   J<small>UDGE</small>.—Better take them all together, sir.
   In two minutes the affidavit was brought into
Court, and read by Dudley Selden. It stated that
himself and Robert <u>Emmett</u>, after duly weighing
all the merits of this case, and the facts for the de-
fence, deemed it unsafe to go to trial in the absence
of a material witness, Caroline M. Henshaw (Colt's
mistress) who was then sick at Philadelphia.
   An affidavit was then read from Dr. <u>McCollon</u>, of
Philadelphia, which stated that Caroline M. Hen-
shaw was under his charge at Philadelphia; that he
knew her condition, that her health was delicate;
that she was then pregnant; that he expected the
period of her confinement hourly, and that it would
not be safe for her, that her life would be endan-
gered should she proceed to New York at this time
to attend the trial.
   A third affidavit was read from Caroline M. <u>Hen-
Henshaw</u> herself. It stated that she was in bad
health, was pregnant, and expected to be confined
every day; that Philadelphia is her home, and all her
friends reside there; that she left New York on or
about the 30th of September; that Justice Taylor
knew of her leaving, and that she entered into
bonds to appear and testify at this trial; that before
leaving she saw the brother of John C. Colt, and
told him that she would appear and testify at his
trial for murder; that she was most willing and de-
sirous to do so; and that she would do so at this
time, if by coming on she should not risk her life
on account of her state of health.
   The only symptoms of emotion shown by J. C.
Colt all the time, was once when his brother enter-
ed the Court room, whom he recognised with a
slight smile; once when the name of Asa Wheeler
was called, at the sound of which his eye lighted up,
his lip curled, and he looked eagerly in the direction
of the answer; and when the condition of Caroline
Henshaw was read; at this last his eyes filled with
tears, and it was with difficulty that he could restrain
himself from sobbing aloud. As soon as he had
read the affidavits,
   D<small>UDLEY</small> S<small>ELDEN</small> said—On these I move the Court
that the trial be put off for this Oyer and Terminer.
It is a right that defendants have to postpone a trial
both in civil and criminal cases, on the absence of a
material witness. We have all the facts here before
us. We show the absence of this important witness
from causes entirely beyond our control. And it
would be unjust to this witness to force her now to
come here, and unjust and unsafe to this prisoner to
proceed to trial without her. Besides, the Court
will recollect, that a very short time has elapsed
since the crime charged against the prisoner is said
to have taken place. The death of Mr. Adams is
said to have occurred about the 18th of September;
(here the prisoner slightly changed color, and the
tears stood in his eyes) the indictment was found on
the 28th of the same month, and the prisoner was
called upon to answer to an examination before the
committing magistrate and to plead to this Court to
the indictment, all in such rapid succession, that at
least no charge can be brought against the officer of
justice for delay, or those who act for the prisoner of
wishing unnecessarily to put off the trial. And I wish
to say a few words more in regard to the treatment of
this case by the press. This case has been more com-
mented upon by the press than almost any other I have
known, and I think rather unfairly. And I would
suggest, whether the prisoner is not entitled in his
condition to have a suspension of further remarks,
at least, until his trial. So much fiction has been
blended with some little fact, that it would be diffi-
cult for any—even unbiassed minds—to come to a
fair and impartial investigation of the case, if this
course be continued. And I would suggest as it is
my duty to do, whether the government on the one
hand, and the prisoner on the other, are not more
likely to have full justice dealt out by a suspension
of these fictitious statements, than if they are con-
tinued? And I say to those who have done this,
more in sorrow than in anger, that I trust they will
see the propriety of a cessation. And it is due, sir,
further, to all the counsel who have volunteered in
this case, (for all <i>have</i> volunteered their aid)
that they have never said—they never gave
utterance to any remark that they had
intended to adopt any particular ground of defence.
It has been charged on us that we intended to raise
insanity as a defense in this cause. We have not
said so—we have not intended it. And most un-
justly the counsel have been distinctly charged with
getting up a fraudulent scheme of defence, as it is
called, for the purpose of defeating the ends of jus-
tice. None of the counsel ever thought of such a
thing. And indeed no plan of defence has been
decided upon, other than what the real merits of the
case may justify an assumption of. There are also
other things which have been stated as coming from
the prisoner or his friends, and various matters in
relation to him, which are utterly untrue. And it
is not fair—it is not just that this course should be
continued. I make these suggestions, sir, because
the remarks I speak of have been directed against
the counsel themselves; and to suggest in a spirit of
kindness, whether there should not be a discontinu-
ance of them. I think, sir, that the public prosecu-
tor cannot object to a postponement, when he takes
into consideration all the circumstances connected
with this witness.
   W<small>HITING</small>.—I shall not make any unnecessary ob-
jection, sir; but the counsel have not stated for how
long a time they require a postponement of this
cause. That this witness, Caroline M. Henshaw, is
a most important one, I do most readily admit. <i>In-
deed I know she is</i>.
   J<small>UDGE</small>.—What was that last remark you made,
sir?
   W<small>HITING</small>.—I consider this witness important. In-
deed I consider her testimony so important for our
side, that it was at my suggestion she was placed
under recognizances to appear and testify on this
trial. I consider her testimony quite as important
for the prosecution as for the defence; and for that
reason I have <u title="subpoenaed">subpœned</u> her; and it is for the con-
sideration of the Court, seeing there is no time
specified in those affidavits, as to whom this is to
be proposed to, to say what disposition shall now be
made of the case.
   P<small>RESCOTT</small> H<small>ALL</small> (Associate counsel)—The affida-
vit is drawn up with as much precision as it was
possible to employ.
   J<small>UDGE</small>—There is another affidavit, Mr. Whiting,
which it seems you did not hear; it is that of Caro-</l9>
<d>[Col.5]</d>
<l9>line M. Henshaw, and was sworn to on the 30th Oc-
tober, 1841.
   [The Judge then read all the material part of that
affidavit again.]
   W<small>HITING</small>.—I, perhaps, sir, may not object to a
reasonable delay; but then I could wish that the
counsel on the other side be required to take out a
commission now to obtain her testimony, in case
anything should happen to prevent her appearing in
person to testify at the time to which this cause may
now be postponed, and so prevent a further post-
ponement. Because, if this cause goes off now be-
cause she is unable to appear, and when it is again
called on for trial should she again fail to appear,
the gentlemen may then move to take out a com-
mission, and so cause a further and unnecessary de-
lay.
   S<small>ELDEN</small>—I consider that there is no doubt but that
we shall be ready by the next Oyer and Terminer.
   W<small>HITING</small>—In the case of Vermilyea, before the
Supreme Court, there was no provision made at
that time for taking testimony by commission in
criminal cases. And the court will see that this
witness is <u title="subpoenaed">subpœned</u> for the defence, and that I have
no power to make her testify under a commission.
It is for the gentlemen on the other side to take that
step.
   H<small>ALL</small> (To the Court)—When will the next Oyer
and Terminer take place?
   J<small>UDGE</small>.—The next will be on the 4th Monday in
December.
   H<small>ALL</small>.—We move then, that, this cause be post-
poned till the next term of the Oyer and Terminer.
We do not wish the testimony of this witness to be
taken by commission. We desire earnestly, that
she should be examined in open court. We deem
that the most proper course; believing that her tes-
timony will have great weight in our behalf, and
more especially under all the circumstances when
delivered here in person, than if taken by commis-
sion. There is no doubt at all, that she will be here
in good faith, when the day of trial comes. (Colt's
eyes glistened with moisture.) And I would submit
to the Court, whether it would be right to urge on
this trial without her presence or testimony. Even
in a civil case, the mere absence of a witness sworn
to as material, is considered sufficient ground for
postponement; and if such is the practice in a mat-
ter of mere dollars and cents, how much more so
should it prevail in a case where the life and death of
a party is at stake. The time asked for is only
some six or seven weeks; and surely, surely, that
is not too long a time to enable this prisoner to look
about him; and if in the event of an unfortunate re-
sult, to prepare to meet his Judge before a higher
tribunal.
   W<small>HITING</small>.—But suppose this woman should die
under her <u title="accouchement">accouchment</u>; if the gentlemen deem
her testimony so important to them, why object to
taking it by commission at once, so as not to be de-
prived of that evidence which they deem to them of
so much value, in case of an event, which is cer-
tainly within the range of possibility, though per-
haps not of probability.
   J<small>UDGE</small>.—We suppose that since the case of Ver-
milyea, argued before the Supreme Court in 1827,
the claim to put off a cause on the part of the prison-
er, on account of the absence of a material witness,
if made at the first term after the indictment has
been found, <i>is a matter of right</i>, and the Court has
no discretionary power in the premises. In the case
of Vermilyea, which is familiar to the public, all
the Judges of the Supreme Court delivered
opinions; and though, it is true, that one of the
judges dissented on some ponts, yet all agreed in the
general doctrine, that where there was no ground to
suppose that the absence of a material witness
sworn to was done as a mere color to procure unne-
cessary delay, and to defeat the ends of justice, that
the postponement at the first time was a matter of
right; and the Court of Oyer and Terminer not hav-
ing heeded this claim of the prisoner, a new trial
was granted. The question for this Court, now, is
to ask is this motion made from motives merely co-
lorable to procure unnecessary delay. First, we
have the absence of this witness proved; then we
have the oath of the physician who swears to her
present condition, and the danger to her life of her
attendance here; and next we have the oaths of
two of her respectable counsel that her evidence is
so important that they cannot safely proceed to the
trial of this cause without her. And we have
no disposition to believe, and indeed no reason
to do so, that they make this statement for a
mere color to procure delay. The <i>cause then
must go off for the term</i>. The next thing to be con-
sidered is the condition that is asked to be annexed
to the postponement by the public prosecutor. At
the commencement <u title="of">or</u> the next term of this Court,
this cause will undoubtedly come up for trial. This
witness has her home at Philadelphia; and should
she then not be present, that city can be reached in
a few hours; and then it will be right to issue a
commission to take her testimony. We think then,
that under all the circumstances, the cause must go
off for the term; and this conclusion arises not only
from our own belief, but is one to which we are
bound to arrive by the law of a higher tribunal.
   At the conclusion of this decision there was some
murmuring out of Court by those who came to hear
the trial. The crowd dispersed instantly. Colt did
not seem much affected by the decision. He slight-
ly moved his head and smiled on his brother as he
left the room; but during the whole time that Judge
Kent was speaking, he kept his eyes fixed with a most
intense gaze upon him.</l9>

	<b>COURT OF OYER AND TERMINER.</b>
   T<small>HE</small> P<small>EOPLE VS.</small> J<small>OHN</small> C. C<small>OLT</small>.—The prisoner
arrived in Court, about half past 8 o'clock, in charge
of the gaoler, and about 9, the gentlemen of the
press were admitted. The prisoner appears to be
about 26 or 27 years of age, stands about five feet
10 inches high, is very good looking, and of gentle-
man-like appearance; and if his countenance and
features were to be taken as an index to his mind,
one would never suppose him to be guilty of the
atrocious murder with which he stands charged.
   He appeared to be in excellent health and spirits,
and conversed freely with the gaoler and others.
	...
   Court—Let the trial go off until the next com-
mission of Oyer and Terminer; and if the witness
does not then attend, let the prisoner's Counsel issue
a commission for the examination of the witness,
in which the public prosecutor may join.

THE MARY ROGERS CASE—AGAIN.
			——
   The New York Mercury gives some addi-
tional particulars, and takes a new view of the
subject.
   “Nothing has yet been discovered that promis-
es to lead to a detection of the “murderers” of
Mary Rogers, nor do we think they ever will be
detected, because we begin to doubt that she was
<u title="murdered">murderad</u> at all. This doubt has been created
by some facts in relation to the finding of the
body—that have come to our knowledge during
the past week—furnished us by an eye witness,
Mr. Henry Mallin of No. 333 Broadway. He
states, that he, Messrs. Thornton and Kavanagh,
vocalists, accompanied by two others, went to
Hoboken on Wednesday the 28th day of July.
While at the Cave, some boys who were fishing
cried out, “there's a dead body.” Mr. Mallin
and his friends went to the edge of the water and
saw the hair washed up from the forehead, and
they then went to the Elysian Fields dock, and
procured a boat and a pair of skulls, and rowed
round to where it was floating between the two
tides. A plank was taken out of the bottom of
the boat, and an attempt made to fasten the bottom
part of the dress to it, in which attempt the dress
was torn. The stern line of the boat was then
fastened round her chin, and they towed her with
the tide to the shore—close to the cave, the rope
was then taken from under her chin and fastened
round her body, and she was left partly in the
water and partly out, one end of the rope being
<u title="fastened">fastenee</u> to a rock on the shore. At this time,
half past 3 in the afternoon, the only marks per-
ceptable about her were a bruise on the left eye,
and a scratch on the left cheek and shoulder,
which Mr. Mallin thought were caused by the
rocks, as she floated on her left side. The coro-
ner was then sent for, and Mr. M., and his party
left and did not return till near 7 o'clock in the
evening, when they found the body had been
drawn up into the foot path, where it had been
<d>[Col.3]</d>
exposed to the sun, and was then in a rapid state
of decomposition—no coroner had made his ap-
pearance.”
   The Mercury complains of the slovenly man-
ner in which the coroner at Hoboken performs
his duties, and is of opinion that Mary Rogers
committed suicide.

   <i>Burning Alive in England</i>.—A London pa-
per states that “a girl was burned alive at Mon-
mouth, on the 1st of April, 1764, her crime be-
ing that of petty treason, or murdering her mis-
tress; that Ann Sowerby was burnt alive in the
city of York, on the 11th August, 1767, for
<u title="poisoning">poisioning</u>, and about ten years afterwards, <u title="Phoebe">Phœ-
be</u> Harris was burnt alive in Smithfield, London
for copper coining.” These are the last instan-
ces of that horrid punishment in England.

  TRIAL OF 112 MEN FOR MURDER.
   The correspondent of the Illinois Free Tra-
der gives an account of the trial of the persons
charged with the murder of the Driskalls, John
and William, from which the Editor of the Era
has made the following extracts:—
   He says, “the September Term of the Ogle
Circuit Court has just closed, and its session has
been marked by a trial, which, in the number of
the accused tried in one indictment for the crime
of murder, is without a parallel. One hundred
and twelve men indicted for the murder of John
Driskall and William Driskall, in June last, near
Washington Grove, in this county. And one
hundred plead not guilty, and put upon their trial.
Judge Ford, whatever might have been his feel-
ings, (the accused were his neighbors, Judge F.
residing in Ogle county) exhibited upon the
bench a stern determination that the accused
should be fully and faithfully tried. However,
the very fact of the great confusion occasioned
by so many names in the indictment, left the ac-
cused without any evidence to contend against.
The two or three first witnesses, whose names
were endorsed upon the indictment, (and by the
laws of this State none, except those whose names
are so endorsed, can be called to prove the sub-
stantive part of the accusation) only knew some
of the preparatory steps taken, which led to the
supposed offence.
   The facts connected with the killing of the
Driskalls are stated as follows: That the Driskalls
were a part of an organized gang embracing a
large number of persons in the county of Ogle
and the adjoining counties, who carried on a <i>sys-
tematized</i> scheme of operations against the lives
and property of the inhabitants. That murders,
robberies and larcenies had been carried on by
them for a number of years; and that, owing to
the extent and perfection of their combinations, it
had become impossible to convict them by the or-
dinary process of law. Perjured members of
their gang swearing to alibis or such defence as
were adapted for the occasion, had, for a long
time, defied and defeated the course of justice.—
That a few days previous to the execution of the
Driskalls, a Mr. Campbell, a citizen of the high-
est respectability, had been wantonly shot in his
own yard, for his presumed exertions against this
gang, and that there was sufficient evidence to
leave no reasonable doubt, that the Driskalls plan-
ned and incited, and probably perpetrated his
murder. Further, that the Driskalls were the
chief and most dangerous of the gang. They
were shot after an examination which satisfied
several hundred of the most respectable citizens of
Ogle and the adjoining counties, of the truth of
the foregoing facts.
   The case was submitted to the jury who, with-
out leaving their seats, rendered a verdict of Not
Guilty. This verdict was partially from a want
of evidence, and from what the jury considered
the absolute necessity of the case. The writer
says the <i>laws</i> could not protect the community
where the banditti committed their many enormi-
ties—the occasion was too urgent to wait for their
uncertain amendment and adaption to the emer-
gency—individually they could not protect them-
selves—mob law they repudiated—they there-
fore resorted to a counter organization, ordained
new rules of evidence, and a new mode of pro-
ceeding, such, and such only, as in their judge-
ment were effectual to protect them. There
may be those who are disposed to cavil, perhaps
to condemn. The judgments and perceptions of
such, would be essentially invigorated, could
they have dwelt for a short time here, and suffer-
ed the murder of their friends, the burning of
their dwellings, and the plunder of their proper-
ty; and when they called on the law to redress
these wrongs, to see those whom they knew to
be the perpetrators, escape with impunity.”

   B<small>OUND TO</small> H<small>OLLAND</small>.—Capt. H. W. Teal, of the
Custom House watch, on Tuesday night, found
an old woman named Mary Driscoll, swimming in
the river, off the Battery, crying out lustily “ship
ahoy!” and saying she was “bound for Holland.”
He got her out with difficulty and lodged her in
the watch house, where she was dried and made
comfortable. Yesterday she was taken to the po-
lice office, and sent to the Lunatic Asylum, as a
person laboring under insanity of mind. She said
she was the heiress of Ireland, and was the Prin-
cess of Rusky Fusky Musky.

   Robert Lydeback, whose arrest together with
James Finnegan and Samuel T. Shreeves, on sus-
picion of being concerned in the murder of Mary
C. Rogers, we noticed sometime since, was brought
upon Monday last before Justice Merritt, of Ho-
boken for a hearing, he, together with Finnegan,
having been delivered at the requisition of the
Governor of New Jersey to the authorities of that
state, on the charge of attempting to commit a rape
on a young woman at Hoboken about the time of
the disappearance of Miss Rogers. No evidence
having been elicited on the examination except
the affidavit of Shreeves, which had been made
some time previously before Justice Merritt, the
counsel for the prisoner, <u title="Martin H. R. Vanhoevenbergh (elsewhere)">M. R. H. Van Hoeven-
bergh</u>, moved for his discharge. After a warm ar-
gument, the District Attorney opposing, he was
committed by Justice Merritt in full for trial.—
This is one of the many cases of a similar nature
brought to light by the melancholy tragedy of
last summer.

   G<small>OING TO</small> H<small>OLLAND BY</small> S<small>WIMMING</small>.—On Tuesday night,
as Capt. H. W. Teal, of the Custom House watch, was
passing along the Battery he saw an old woman named
Mary Driscoll, swimming in the water after a boat, and
crying out as loud as she could bawl, “ship ahoy,” and
when hailed, replied she was “bound for Holland.” The
Captain conceiving that the old woman was more likely to
get to a watery grave than to Holland, with much diffi-
culty recovered her from her perilous situation and con-
veyed her to the watch house, where she was dried off
and rendered as comfortable as possible. Yesterday
morning on being ushered into the Police Office, she said
she was the “Great heiress of Ireland, and the princess of
Rusky Tusky Musky,” and the magistrate to relieve her
mental malady, and prevent her swimming to Holland
again, sent her to the Lunatic Asylum on Blackwell's
Island.

   T<small>HE</small> N<small>EWSPAPER</small> R<small>EVOLUTION</small>.—The “Commer-
cial Advertiser” has announced the final death of
the “Evening Star,” established by Noah, and at
the same time enlarged its own size in order to give
room in its bowels for the accession of the latter.
We consider this movement as a strong indication
of the decay of the “Commercial.” Every “old
fashioned paper” has gone through the same pro-
cess before its final death.
	...
Herald, for instance, has a universal circulation, and
it is out of the power of any bank, clique, or par-
ty, to control or overawe its course. The same is
the case with nearly all the other cash papers.

   C<small>ARE OF</small> P<small>RISONERS</small>.—It is not a great while ago,
since we recorded the successful escape of a convict-
ed felon from the Egyptian Tombs, a “cove” who
walked out of the doors and past two of the keepers
in the most <i>naive</i> and pleasant manner possible. At
that time, it was thought to be an error of judgment,
but, if an <i>on dit</i> which was related yesterday by a
gentleman, having authority, is correct, we should
not be surprised if some other equally worthy fellow,
if not equal in respectability, had changed his quar-
ters from the Tombs to some better located and
more pleasant abode. The report is this—that a
most confirmed scoundrel, now fully committed to
take his trial, is allowed to have sufficient indul-
gence in the City Prison, to enable him, to carry on
the very same practices, for which he will have to
be tried at the present, or the next term of the Court
of General Sessions. The gentleman who related
this extraordinary report, said, that it was not en-
tirely the fault of Mr. Hyde the keeper—and subse-
quent enquiries of Mr. H. confirms that opinion—
but that the lenity was granted by the “understrap-
pers,” at the instance of one of the Police Magis-
trates. There needs no comment on this.

  A<small>N</small> I<small>LLUSTRIOUS</small> S<small>TRANGER</small>.—The night before
last, as Captain Teale, of the city watch, was pe-
rambulating the Battery, he heard a loud splash in
the water, and on looking over the rails, he saw a
female figure, bobbling about in the water, and
swimming right out into the stream, shouting ship
ahoy! ship ahoy! The watchman called to the
woman to know where she was going, and her re-
ply was, that she was bound to Holland! As this
settled the point of her sanity, the watchman got a
boat, pulled after the intrepid voyageress, and by
great exertion induced her to alter her course, and
come ashore, which she did, and then she could
have said, like the man in Coleridge's tragedy of
Remorse—
				Drip, drip, drip,
	There is nothing here but dripping.
   The poor creature was put in a coach, and trans-
ferred to the tombs, where her wants were attended
to. In the morning, when brought up for examina-
tion, she styled herself the Right Worshipful heiress
of all Ireland, and Princess of Rusky-fusky-musty-
tuskykuff. It turned out, on further inquiry, that her
name was Mary Driscoll, and that she was a little
wrong in the upper story. She had escaped, by
some neglect, form her home, and, having drank a
little, had jumped into the North River after a boat
which she fancied she could catch, and in which she
could take a voyage to Holland. She was, of
course, restored to her friends, who are highly re-
spectable.

   <f12>THE BACHELOR'S LAMENT.</f12>
<m9>	They tell me to hasten, and marry—
	   But ah! 'tis the cost that I fear;
	And prudence still warns me to tarry,
	   Ere seeking amusement so dear.

	Oh! there's rapture unmeasured in wooing,
	   And sweet the <u title="confusion (elsewhere)">confession</u> when won;
	But the house-keeping horrors, pursuing,
	   Are sure to make sentiment run.

	Thus I mused t'other night, as fair Chloe
	   Swam round in the dance at my side;
	I must furnish that wardrobe so showy,
	   If rashly I make her my bride.

	That slim, fairy foot, and its fellow,
	   That tread the light measure so gay,
	Must with satin be shod, and prunella,
	   And husband the piper must pay.

	At a glance of that ankle so slender
	   My heart the dear bargain would close;
	When my head bids me, ere I surrender,
	   Remember the price of the hose.

	That hand, so desired beyond measure,
	   The suitor, that ventures to hold,
	Can only secure such a treasure
	   By hooping the fingers with gold.

	Those eyes, though their vision surpasses
	   The eagle's that pierces the light,
	Must be <i>aided</i> with opera-glasses,
	   <u>Howev'er</u> they embarrass the sight.

	Though made up of roses thy face is,
	   Such roses bloom not in the sun;
	We must veil them in the best of point laces,
	   Or freckles will soon overrun.

	Sweetest mouth that e'er smiled upon mortal,
	   Hides organs of hunger within;
	And dainties must pass the red portal,
	   Or soon cherry lips will grow thin.

	Ah! that charms so desired by a lover
	   Have duties so costly assigned—
	That the pearls, which thy smiles now uncover,
	   The choice of the market must grind!

	Thy form richest fabrics must cumber
	   With many a garment of show;
	And with doubtless of others a number
	   That bachelors never may know.

	Thy brow, the fair temple where towers
	   High honor in marble enshrined,
	Must be thatched with straw, feathers, and flowers,
	   To keep out the sun and the wind.

	Thy care must be constantly petting
	   With rarest cosmetics thy face—
	Thy nose, be indulged in coquetting
	   With 'kerchiefs bewildered with lace.

	Those tresses, ensnaring allurers,
	   With fillets of gold must be bind;
	Thy ears must be fed with bravuras,
	   And hung with the jewels of Ind.

	Strange! that man should embellish a creature
	   Already more fair than the morn;
	That the being most gifted by Nature
	   Is the one we most love to adorn.

	Why was Eden so pleasant to Adam—
	   So rid of connubial ills?
	Because his ingenuous madam
	   Ne'er bored him with milliners' bills.

	No bonnets had she for her tresses—
	   No silks did her person enroll;
	So cheap were her costliest dresses,
	   For a fig one had purchased the whole.

	Ah! that was the season to marry,
	   Ere fashion made woman her thrall,
	Her trumpery-garments to carry—
	   Yes! clothes are the curse of the fall!</m9>

   <i>What are Yankees?</i>—This query seems to be an-
swered definitively. If there has been any question
in the premises, it is settled, and we hope hereafter
to have no more doubts expressed. The pupils of the
Deaf and Dumb Asylum in Philadelphia were lately
examined in “the Arts and Sciences,” and among
other difficult questions proposed, was this one—
“What are Yankees?” This poser was put to the
youngest female pupil; but she, either not being
learned enough to answer, or being unwilling to com-
mit herself upon a moot point, turned the interroga-
tory over to her mater, who, after pondering a little
upon it, took her pencil and wrote—“<i>They are a peo-
ple living in the Eastern States, famous for making
wooden nutmegs</i>.” It is astonishing to what perfec-
tion physiological science has arrived.

after a passage of twenty-one days, reached South-
ampton, England, on the 21st ult. She entered that
port the same day that the great steamer Oriental
arrived from Alexandria, Egypt, thus giving the
English an opportunity to compare the most superb
built American steam-ship with the most superb
built English steam-ship afloat.
   It is seen that the <u>Kamschatka</u> had apparently
rather a long passage across the Atlantic, longer than
fast steamers generally have. It must, however, be
borne in mind, that for some time after she sailed,
weather, most severe, was experienced by all ves-
sels in the latitudes and longitudes she must have
been in. It should also be borne in mind that she
was new, deeply laden, burned anthracite coal, used
no blowers, and had more untried principles about
her hull and machinery than any steamer on the
Atlantic, Pacific or Indian Oceans.
   She has crossed the Atlantic in the worst season
of the year, and under disadvantages never so great,
which ought to be evidence enough to show that
her machinery, her half beam engines, invented by
Wm. A. Lighthall, engineer of the swift steamer
Troy, on the North River, are admirably adapted to
ocean steamers. That they work smoothly and pro-
pel a vessel through the water steadily was sufficient-
ly shown before the <u>Kamschatka</u> departed on her
final passage over the Atlantic.
   These half beam engines on a pretty large scale
are soon to be tried on the North River in a steamer
of one thousand tons, and then those interested can
see their capabilities.

   <i>The Steamer <u>Kamschatka</u></i>.—The arrival of this mag-
nificent war steamer at Southampton, England, was
announced in our columns on Tuesday morning.
   Our readers are aware that a very severe gale oc-
curred shortly after her sailing, in consequence of
which, some little anxiety was felt for her by those
who were not familiar with her strength and model.
We however, felt no alarm on this subject. We have
repeatedly said that she was the most perfect <i>ocean
steamer</i> ever built, and that her speed would exceed
that of any other steam Frigate.
   On her model we need not speak. That cannot be
surpassed; and in this respect as in all others, her
superiority will not only permanently establish the
reputation of the Messrs. S<small>CHUYLER</small>, but at the same
time prove the accuracy of their judgment in selecting
<u title="LIGHTHALL">L<small>IGHTALL</small></u>'s Engine.
   It will be perceived by the following letter from
our friend G<small>EORGE</small> L. S<small>CHUYLER</small>, that this noble ship
has been tested in every way; and that in all respects
she equals the most sanguine anticipations of her
contractors.
   In the first place, her Engines and their power have
been fairly tested in a very severe gale of wind with
a head sea; next, her <i>speed</i> is demonstrated to be su-
perior to that of any war steamer ever built; and
thirdly, her <i>model</i>, and consequently, her qualifica-
tions as a <i>sailing vessel</i> independent of her steam,
have been fully proved, by her making 197 miles in
twenty-four hours, without studding sails.
   We congratulate Messrs. R<small>OBERT</small> and G<small>EORGE</small>
S<small>CHUYLER</small>, and all concerned in her construction,
and the country at large, upon the perfect success
which has attended this first experiment in building
war and ocean steamers in the United States. In
another column is an article on the subject of our
Navy Commissioners, written before the arrival of
the <i>Great Western</i> and crowded out on Tuesday and
yesterday, in which we give the cost of this noble
steamer and ventured to predict her superiority to all
others.
<l9>		S<small>OUTHAMPTON</small>, (Eng.) Oct. 21, 1841.
   M<small>Y</small> D<small>EAR</small> S<small>IR</small>—I promised you, at parting, some
account of the first voyage of the <u>Kamschatka</u>; the
circumstances attending it have been of an unusual
character, and as she is the first American built war-
steamer that has crossed the Atlantic, I shall proceed
to give you a somewhat detailed account.
   I regretted that there was not sufficient time to
warm the engines and allow our friends who accom-
panied us to Sandy Hook, an opportunity of judging
of the speed of the vessel; but very soon after you
left us we were going nine knots and continued to do
so regularly for two days, occasionally going up to
ten knots, with every prospect of a speedy run across
the ocean.
   On Saturday night, Oct. 2d, it commenced blowing
very heavily from E. N. E. With a head wind the
boilers make any desired quantity of steam; we car-
ried 12 lbs., made 10 revolutions, and went 5½ knots
dead to windward.
   Sunday morning, Oct. 3d—Gale increasing. Sun-
day night, carried away side houses forward of
wheels—still going 3 knots to windward.
   Monday morning, Oct. 4th—Wind suddenly ceased,
leaving us with a very heavy sea, which tried the en-
gines more than the blow.
   Tuesday morning, Oct. 5th—At 9 A. M. commenc-
ed blowing harder than ever—increasing all day, at
8 P. M. it was blowing a hurricane. At that time I
was working the engines with 14 lbs. of steam, mak-
ing 9 revolutions. Captain Von <u title="Schantz">Shantz</u> thought it
best not to risk the engines with so great a strain, and
at midnight the ship was laid to by placing canvass
bags in the rigging, and reducing the speed of the
engines to 6 revolutions.
   In this manner we rode out the blow, which lasted
until the next day. During all this time we never
shipped a sea, or lost any thing but our houses on
the guards.
   That you may not suppose that my inexperience
has exaggerated the violence of the wind and sea, I
will give you an example of its force.
   The seas were so high that our trysails were be-
calmed between them, and when the roof of our
side house on the after guard was blown off, it
lodged twenty feet from the deck in the mizen
shrouds. It required many hands to get it down,
and it blew about on the deck very much like a large
sheet of paper on the ground in a gusty day. The
quarter boat, on the windward side, had its bottom
pressed in by the force of the wind, and the iron da-
vits to which it was suspended were bent inboard.
   The wind continued to blow gales, form nearly ev-
ery quarter, for the next four days.
   October 10th—Heavy gale from W. N. W. As it
was now impossible to make a short voyage, or to
avoid stopping in England for coals, as we wish to
carry out some of our Anthracite to Russia, Captain
Von <u title="Schantz">Shantz</u> determined to carry sail without steam
for several days, that he may make a full report upon
his arrival, of her general capacities as a war steam-
er, of which her speed and working under sail are
important items. Accordingly, from the 11th to the
14th, the ship was tried under sail in every possible
way—before the wind, close hauled, &c.; time of
connecting and disconnecting engines was noted, al-
tering buckets, &c., &c.
   To show you her sailing qualities—from 12 o'clock
October 12th to 12 o'clock October 13th, 197 miles;
next day at 12, 176 miles—fair wind both days. We
had no sails bent but fore course, fore and maintop-
sail and fore and main topgallantsail, although the
wind would have allowed carrying studding sails.
   On the morning of the 15th we again began to
steam—
15th, 12 o'clock to 16th, 12 o'clock, dist. run 240 miles.
16th		do	to 17th		do		255 do
17th		do	to 18th		do		246 do
18th		do	to 19th		do		200 do
   Commenced blowing very heavy, gale from North.
Made the Lizard at 8 P. M.—lay to for a pilot off
Plymouth. We came through the channel this day,
blowing fresh—we made 14 revolutions and passed
every steamer we saw.
   We have had but one day of fine weather since we
left New York, and have never had a smooth sea af-
ter the first 12 hours.
   By the above memoranda from our log book, you
will see that the speed of the ship, either under steam
or sails, will equal all that was expected of her. Of
her machinery I can only say, that it is just as per-
fect as when it left New York. At no time have the
engines complained—nothing has broken, nothing
is strained.
   I had intended to send you for publication some
memoranda, as to the performance of these engines,
to the particulars wherein they differ from those of
English construction; but as my letter has reached
so great a length, I shall defer it until after my arri-
val at St. Petersburgh.
		Very truly, <u>your's</u>, &c.

Southampton, (Eng.) Oct. 21, 1841, has been re-
ceived from Mr. Geo. <u title="L. (elsewhere)">S.</u> Schuyler, who went out as
Commander of this vessel. It is conclusive as to
the success of the voyage, under the most trying

usually boisterous, and they had, during the entire
passage, but one fine day, and never and a smooth
sea after the first twelve hours. On arrival, the
machinery was as perfect as when she left New-
York, and fully justifies the most sanguine expect-

counterfeits and imitations are continually attempted to be
palmed off for the genuine. Cheap common pills are purcha-
sed at twelve cents a box, put up in different boxes, and called
“Female Monthly Pills,” with the object of selling, if possible,
at one dollar. Females are therefore cautioned against these
attempts to impose upon them. It is sufficient here to state
that all Female Monthly Pills are counterfeits, except those
sold at Madame Restell's Principal Office, 148 Greenwhich st.,
New York, and No. 7 Essex street, Boston. Price $1.

<b>American Ocean Steam Navigation—The
	Russian Steamer <u>Kamschatka</u>.</b>
   The entire success of the Russian steamer <u>Kam-
schatka</u>, built in this city for the Emperor Nicholas
—her recent arrival out in England, on her way to
Petersburg—and the new era it opens to this coun-
try in ocean steam navigation, have created much
rivalry and contest among the various persons con-
cerned in her construction, for the credit and honor
of the effort.
   On several occasions we have stated facts on this
subject—and distributed the credit to all the various
persons concerned, with as strict justice and accu-
racy as we could ascertain. Meantime an effort
has been made in certain corrupt and degraded
journals in Wall street, to take away this credit
from those modest engineers and humble mecha-
nics who deserved it, and to place it altogether and
exclusively with the Messrs. Schuyler, of this city,
who were merely the disbursing agents of the Rus-
sian government, and are entitled to none of the
credit of the engineers and mechanics, whose ge-
nius combined in her construction.
   As the best proof of this assertion, we annex the
following statement, made by Mr. Dodge, the very
eminent engineer who made the drawings of the
engine:—
<m9>M<small>R.</small> B<small>ENNETT</small>:—
   I have seen several times in your valuable paper, and
also in other papers, reports respecting the Steamship
<u>Kamschatka</u>. Now, to show you that these reports are
erroneous, and some of them wrong and foremost, and,
as you say in your paper, I would like to set the whole
affair right, and give each his due.
   What you say respecting Captain Von <u title="Schantz">Shauntz</u>, and
Captain Pepin, and Lieutenant <u title="Scharoubine, Sherburne (elsewhere)">Scheronbine</u>, being sent to
this country, is perfectly true; as also about Captain
Von <u title="Schantz">Shauntz</u>' going back from this country to Russia,
and there giving a statement to the Emperor, in person,
and not the Navy Board, is also right. As regards
their making the plans for the ship, and examining
every line of her model, making all the necessary ar-
rangements for armament, &c., is perfectly correct. I
can answer for their capability as Naval Engineers.
One and all of them were very intelligent men, and
perfect gentlemen. Now, sir, giving them all the
credit for what they have done about the ship, is, I pre-
sume, sufficient. As regards Mr. Wm. A. Lighthall giving
Captain Von <u title="Schantz">Shauntz</u>'s plans of two marine engines, the
one the whole beam, and the other the half beam, that
is also true. But as regards Mr. Lighthall, or the Rus-
sian Engineers having any hand in arranging the
machinery, is incorrect.
   Now to the whole history. It will be two years next
January, since Mr. H. R. Dunham called at my office in
Broadway, and said to me, if I could make a good ar-
rangement for a pair of marine engines, that he could
probably get the job. My answer was, that I would do
my best. (Now you must understand that for twelve
months previous to this I was acquainted with Lieut.
<u>Scheronbine</u> and Captain Pepin.) So I went to work by
myself, and no one to dictate, only having a small pen
sketch of the shape of the half beam engine, and that
merely the cylinder and beam—nothing to be called a
drawing. It was merely meant to convey the idea. I
went to work; I got the drawings of the ship which
were made by Captain Pepin and sent me, and in three
weeks finished my calculations and drawings. During
this time, however, Lieutenant <u>Scheronbine</u> called at my
office, and asked me whether the drawings were finish-
ed. I told him nearly so, not knowing that it was to be
kept a secret. He went and told Mr. Schuyler that I
was making the drawings; in answer to which Mr.
Schuyler said he knew no such man, and that it was false.
However, in the morning after, Mr. Dunham called on
me, and said I had done wrong as regards telling them
any thing about it, and to make the whole thing straight
he must introduce me to Mr. Schuyler.
   Now, sir, you see that I did the drawings for Dunham,
“from” Dunham “to” Schuyler, and from thence to
the Russian officers. Such was the way of whipping
the cat around the post.
   Two or three morning afterwards I went to the Rus-
sian officers' room in Park Place to get a drawing which
I had lent them, for I had lent and given them some hun-
dred dollars' worth of matter during their sojourn here,
and I should not have done so, had I not found them gentle-
men. On my entering their room, I was accosted with the
ordinary “How-d'ye-do?” &c.—sat down, smoked a segar,
saw all the models of their cannon, &c., and presently in
walked Captain Pepin, with my drawing in his hand,
laughing, and opening it, showed me where the name on
the drawing had been erased, and the name of R. & G.
L. Schuyler attached as “Engineers.” We all had a
hearty laugh. They told me that it was ever a great
mystery to them why I should have been denied the
credit of my work. However, I said nothing. I was
engaged to lay down the whole thing for the workmen,
and to proportion every piece of metal about it. This
was done by “me and no one else,” on he floor of the
factory at Jersey City, on paper seventy-five feet long
and twenty-eight feet wide. No one ever assisted me
but a lad, the brother of Mr. Dunham, for the purpose of
holding my straight edge. I completed the full size
drawing. This took me about three months more. I
then made the detailed drawings, to be sent to the No-
velty Yard, for the casting of the cylinders, air pump
and condenser, all of which Messrs. Ward and Silliman
know. After this, I got my money, and all seemed satis-
fied.
   These are the facts. The original conception of that
form of engine was first thought of by Mr. Lighthall;
and it's his, and no man should rob him of it, be he whom
he may. But as regards taking the credit of arrang-
ing the machinery, he never knew the drawings
had been touched for a month after they were
finished. The credit of the frame of the engines be-
longs to Mr. R. S. Schuyler; and the engines were made</m9>
<d>[Col.4]</d>
<m9>by Mr. H. R. Dunham, both very competent men in
their way. In apportioning the credit I will do it
as follows:—Captain Pepin drew the lines of the
ship; Mr. Brown made the ship; Messrs. R. and G.
L. Schuyler were the agents for the Government and
arranged the boilers through the assistance of Mr. H. R.
Dunham. They are the best boilers in the world for
the burning of any kind of fuel, either for sea or river
purpose; and they will show to all the world, that <u title="tubular">tube-
lar</u> boilers are as good to go to sea with, if not better
than any other, if properly constructed. I myself, ar-
ranged the machinery, with the exception of putting on
the cut off. I proportioned every piece of it, and can
produce twenty witnesses to prove it. Why then all
this blowing off about it? Shame gentlemen! But if
after all these facts, the credit for arranging the ma-
chinery is worth any thing to any body, take it, for its
my every day business; and if men would keep to their
business, take to themselves that which is due them,
and no more, they would find that an intelligent public
would better appreciate them.
				Yours,
					PAUL R. HODGE,
		C<small>IVIL</small> E<small>NGINEER</small>, No. 10 Green Street.
   As regards the credit of arranging the machinery to
Mr. Lighthall, it amounts to this—the shape of the pre-
sent marine engine now used in the Great Western and
other boats, was first suggested by Bolton & Watt, and
improved by David Napier of Glasgow. I would ask,
what has Bolton & Watt or David Napier had to do in
the getting up of the Western's machinery? Nothing—it
was Mr. Joshua Field and no one else. I would also state
that I saw a drawing making of Mr. Lighthall's engine
for him some eight months prior to the Russian frigate's
keel being laid, by a young man of the name of Glass,
so that he had not thought that any one wanted to rob
him of the credit of it. It is a very good engine, and
with some alterations, I believe to be equal to any thing
extant for sea-going boats.				P. R. H.</m9>
   From this plain statement it is evident that the
assumptions made by the Wall street prints in favor
of the Messrs. Schuylers are utterly without foun-
dation. These gentlemen, both lawyers, are very
respectable worthy men and good agents—but we
do not see why the credit of constructing this splen-
did steamer should be taken from the engineers and
mechanics, and monopolized by money agents and
lawyers. The <u>Kamschatka</u> is undoubtedly a proud
monument of American skill in mechanism, but it
happens oddly enough that the Emperor of Russia
was the first man who had the sense to appreciate
that genius—the talent to combine that skill—and
the energy to bring it forth in triumph and per-
fection before the world, and thus “at one fell
swoop” beat England at her own game.
   What a strong lesson this ought to teach our own
government! Why should not the President and
cabinet think of this, and combine the same talent
in the service of their own country?

	Correspondence of the Tribune.
   <b>Mr. Fenimore Cooper and his Libels.</b>
					F<small>ONDA</small>, Nov. 17, 1841.
   The Circuit Court, now sitting here, is to be oc-
cupied chiefly with the legal griefs of Mr. F<small>ENI-
MORE</small> C<small>OOPER</small>, who has determined to avenge him-
self upon the Press for having contributed, by its
criticisms, to his waning popularity as a novelist.
   The 'handsome Mr. Effingham' has three causes
at issue here, two of which are against Col. W<small>EBB</small>,
Editor of the Courier and Enquirer, and one against
Mr. W<small>EED</small>, Editor of the Albany Evening Journal.
	...
   The Jury retired under a strong charge against
Mr. Weed from Judge Willard, and after remain-
ing in their room till 12 o'clock at night, sealed a
verdict for $400 for Mr. Effingham, which was
delivered to the Court this morning.
   This meagre verdict, under the circumstances,
is a severe and mortifying rebuke to Cooper, who
had every thing his own way.
   The value of Mr. Cooper's character, therefore,
has been judicially ascertained. <i>It is worth ex-
actly four hundred dollars</i>.
   Col. Webb's trial comes on this afternoon, his
Counsel, A. L. Jordan, Esq. having just arrived in
the up train. Cooper will be blown sky-high.
This experiment upon the Editor of the Courier
and Enquirer will, I predict, cure the 'handsome
Mr. Effingham' of his monomania for Libels.

   <i>The Cooper Libels</i>.—We are compelled to omit to-
day a report of our trial at the Montgomery circuit
last week, on an indictment for libel upon J. <u title="FENIMORE">F<small>ENNI-
MORE</small></u> C<small>OOPER</small>, alias “the Handsome E<small>DWARD</small> E<small>F-
FINGHAM</small>.” Suffice it to say, that after a full hearing
upon the merits of our review of “<a href="http://archive.org/details/homeasfound01cooprich">Home</a> <a href="http://archive.org/details/homeasfound02cooprich">as Found</a>,”
the Jury reported to the court that they could not
agree—announcing at the same time that the vote
within five minutes after they retired, stood ELEVEN
to ONE in favor of an acquittal!! Thus much for
his anticipated and boasted triumph over the press.
   We venture to predict that he will not again ap-
peal to the people for a verdict in his behalf, unless
indeed, he should find some new pretext again to
change the venue. <i>Otsego</i> and <i>Montgomery</i> have
both repudiated him; and we do not believe twelve
men can be selected in any one county in the United
States, who do not think that he merits even greater
severity from the Press than he has yet received.—
The people every where, appear to entertain very simi-
lar opinions of his slanderous publications in relations
to America and Americans; and we doubt not but he
will now acquiesce in the decision which all but him-
self have long since arrived at, viz: that it is very
silly and very ridiculous to imagine that he or his
books are of sufficient importance to occupy the time
of courts with no other earthly object but to cater to his
love of notoriety,—and equally idle to suppose that
they will attempt to muzzle the Press when exhibi-
ting him in his true colors.

Esq., of counsel, addressed the Court in behalf of Mr.
Glentworth, indicted for a misdemeanor in introducing
illegal votes into this city from Philadelphia, and stating
that the accused, having been once tried, and the jury be-
ing unable to agree, and that the accused having been at
all times ready for trial, and although notice having been
given to the District Attorney at a former term that the
accused was ready for trial, and that unless the case were
called up and tried at the present term, he should move
for a <i>nolle prosequi</i>,—now moved the Court to enter a
<i>nolle prosequi</i> to the indictment. The Court suggested
that they would discharge the recognizance which held
the defendant to bail, but this the counsel refused posi-
tively, stating that he would have a <i>nolle prosequi</i> or no-
thing. After some remarks from the District Attorney,
tending to show the length of the former trial, occupying
a week, the great difficulty in re-assembling the witnesses
from another State, the constant occupancy of his time
in multiplicity of business of his office, and his unwilling-
ness to subject the County to the heavy expenses of an-
other trial the result of which was involved in much
doubt, he submitted the matter to the Court without en-
tering further objections. The Court ordered the <i>nolle

for a <i>nolle prosequi</i>, which, after a few remarks from the
District Attorney, the Court allowed to be entered, and
the accused was discharged from custody.

   A<small>DMINISTRATION OF</small> C<small>RIMINAL</small> J<small>USTICE AT THE</small>
S<small>ESSIONS</small>.—We have only time to-day, to refer our
pious readers to another chapter of the history of the
Court of Sessions, during its present curious organi-
zation. It will repay perusal. The charge of Re-
corder Tallmadge is reported by the same gentleman
who was excluded from the Court by an illegal or
informal <a class="l" href="#Herald-1841-06-16-2">order of Noah's</a>—on the ground of not re-
porting accurately. It was on his report, also, on
which this Journal was indicted by Lynch and Noah,
for the heinous crime of bringing these two function-
aries into contempt. But more than this. That much
abused patriot and pipe-layer, Master Glentworth,
has been released by the order of the same Court—
and also a man charged with bigamy, or marrying
two wives, was let off at the same time. Can the
Herald bring such a Court into more contempt than
its own acts do? We put this question to marines.

<d>[Col.4]</d>
   G<small>LENTWORTH</small> D<small>ISCHARGED</small>.—On motion of James
M. Smith, jr. Esq., one of the counsel for James
B. Glentworth before the Court of Sessions, yester-
day a <i>nolle prosequi</i> was entered in the suit against
this individual by the Court. The counsel for Glent-
worth in asking for this discharge stated that they
had been ready for trial for the last several terms,
and as the Court had stated at the last term, that
unless the District Attorney brought the case to
trial at the present term they would order a <i>nolle
prosequi</i> to be entered; they now asked
the Court to carry out their previous decision.
The Court stated that they were ready to dis-
charge his recognizances at once, but desired to
hold him ready for trial on the indictment whenever
called for, on his own recognizance. To this his
counsel objected, stating that they would have a <i>nolle
prosequi</i> or nothing. The District Attorney stated
that the delay, doubt and expense attending the trial
of this notorious personage was such as to induce
him to leave the matter entirely to the Court for de-
cision; when they immediately entered a <i>nolle prose-
qui</i>, which terminates the recent charges that have
been lying against him, and on which he cannot be
again tried.

<m9>   ☞ In the Cooper vs. Webb case of Cooper against
Webb for libel, tried last week at Fonda, the jury stood
eleven to one for acquittal. But in the great case of
Ring's Candy versus all others, for the perfect and
speedy cure of colds, coughs, asthma, consumption, &c.
the verdict, with the whole people for a jury, is unani-
mous to a man in favor of Ring, and well does the evi-
dence which each day is putting in bearing upon this
question, sustained this verdict. Witnesses are on the
stand from all parts of the country joyfully testifying to
the cures perfected by this powerful remedy. It is for

<b>The Currency—Little Biddle's Operations.</b>
   We understand that the public continue to return
the Ulster Manufacturers' Bank notes, and the Jack-
sonville bills, upon the Sun office, for instant redemp-
tion. From the outcry of that shaving concern, we
should believe it so. In Ulster County, few of these
bills are in circulation—the attempts to push them
out have been made principally in New York and
Boston. Yesterday we received the following correc-
tion from the Ulster County Bank, which is a legiti-
mate concern, and ought not to be mixed up with
Little Biddle's schemes:—
<m9>	...
		[From the Boston Mail.]
   T<small>HE</small> B<small>EAUTIES OF</small> R<small>ED</small> D<small>OG</small> C<small>URRENCY I</small>N N<small>EW</small> Y<small>ORK</small>
—C<small>ONTINUED</small>.—Some time since, we gave a somewhat
lengthy article upon the “free” banking system in New
York, as exemplified by a penny-whistle concern called
the “Manufacturers' Bank” at Ulster. This concern,
although nominally located at Ulster—an out-of-the-
way place, where no one would ever think of carrying
a bill to be redeemed—is in reality located at the office
of a scurrilous paper in New York city called the “Sun,”
the advocate of rag banks, and the organ of quack doc-
tors in general, and Madame Restell in particular. The
bills of the bank aforesaid are all, or nearly all, issued at
the “Sun” office; but instead of being redeemed in good
faith at par, at the same place, are shaved at a half per
	...</m9>
   From all these notices, it is evident that there is a
healthy spirit in the country, that never will submit
to these impudent financiers, who leave the jack-
plane to manufacture money. Such is Beach, alias
Little Biddle—and such are they all. Another sin-
gular feature, is the probability that an extensive
confederacy of the penny press, in our large cities,
was engaged in this scheme. The central organ
was the “New York Sun;” but we have reason to
believe that the “Boston Times,” “Philadelphia
Ledger,” and “Baltimore Sun,” were in the same
scheme, and pledged to the same doctrines. As it
was nipped in the bud by our vigilance at head quar-
ters, it has failed—but it ought to be a warning to
the honest portion of the public, from trusting in the
integrity of such prints. More sketches hereafter.

MR. FENIMORE COOPER, AND HIS LI-
		BELLERS.
		   ——
   We insert in another column, a plain and di-
rect statement by Mr. C<small>OOPER</small>, of the facts, in
relation to the recent verdict taken against the
editor of the Ev. J. at the Montgomery circuit.
	...

<d>[Col.5]</d>
Editor of Albany Argus.
   The New York Tribune, and Albany Evening
Journal, having both published false statements
concerning the proceedings connected with the
inquest taken in my suit against Thurlow Weed,
at the late Montgomery circuit, I ask room for
the following statement of facts.
   The cause was first noticed for trial in May last.
Mr. Weed then appeared <i>without counsel</i>, and ask-
ed for delay on the plea that he had <i>forgotten that
the cause had been noticed!</i> The judge granted a
delay of six months on this plea, saying at the
time that the application was <i>exceedingly feeble</i>.
   At the late Circuit we appeared the first day,
and Mr. Weed did not. The Evening Journal
says, “Cooper's cause against us stood nearly at
the foot of the calendar, and would not have been
reached in the ordinary course of business, until
the last of the week.” It was number thirteen,
in a calendar of forty, and was reached the first
day. The allegation of the Tribune, that “Coop-
er moved for judgment by default” is utterly un-
true. When the case was called, we merely said
we were ready, and when the statement was made
that Mr. Weed was detained by the indisposition
of a child, the court distinctly refused to grant a
delay on <i>such a plea presented in such a manner</i>.—
My counsel were opposed to the delay, believing
the whole to be a trick. An appeal was then
made personally to myself, and I consented to a
delay until the cars should arrive on the follow-
ing day, in direct opposition to the advice of my
counsel, openly expressed in court, and at a mo-
ment when the judge said that this delay entirely
rested with myself. It was clearly expressed by
me at the time of granting this delay, and as
clearly assented to by Mr. Sacia in behalf of Mr.
Weed, that I was to take by inquest the next day,
unless some one should appear to defend the suit.
Mr. Sacia had openly stated on the authority of
Mr. Webb, and as coming from Mr. Weed, that
Mr. Hill, a lawyer of merit, was to appear for the
defendant; but, at the time when this statement
was made, a person of respectability informed
me that he was confident that Mr. Hill had no
such intention. The cause lay over for twenty-
four hours.
   The next day, two trains arrived from Albany,
with intervals of two or three hours, before the
cause was moved by us. Neither Mr. Weed, nor
Mr. Hill had arrived. I may say here that the
latter did not attend the circuit at all. Mr. Sacia
asked for further delay; the court answered it
would grant no delay without the consent of par-
ties. I then stated, I left the matter with the
court, and that I had no faith in the excuses. The
result was an inquest, and a verdict of $400.
   It remains only to say that Mr. Weed had plead-
ed the general issue, <i>without notice</i>. Of course he
could not justify. We held his full admission of
publication, &c., and of course he was totally
without defence. These facts were stated by the
judge to the jury as reasons why the defendant's
rights could not materially suffer by taking the
inquest. The attorneys on record for Mr. Weed
are Messrs. Parmelee and Loveridge, of the city
of Albany; neither of those gentlemen has ever
appeared in this case at Fonda, nor was any affi-
davit, but one founded on <i>hearsay</i>, offered.
   I have directed legal proceedings to be com-
menced against the editors, publishers, &c. of the
Tribune and Evening Journal.
			Yours respectfully,
				J. FENIMORE COOPER.

   M<small>ORE</small> E<small>VIDENCE OF THE</small> W<small>ONDERFUL</small> I<small>NFLUENCE
OF THE</small> N<small>EW</small> Y<small>ORK</small> H<small>ERALD</small>.—Little Biddle, proprie-
tor of the New York Sun, and financier of the Ulster
and Jacksonville shinplaster banks, has come forth at
last and given, unasked, his evidence in favor of the
astonishing influence and power of the Herald over
public opinion. Heretofore “Col. Webb, of the re-
gular army,” and his coadjutors, have proved to the
world that we broke up the “coon-skin cabinet”—
that we defeated the new bank bill at the Extra Ses-
sion—that we exploded the whig party—and that
we ruined the United States Bank, the North Ame-
rican Trust Company, and all State stocks in Eng-
land. The Colonel also admitted and asserted that
the London Times merely copied and imitated the
Herald, and that when we were in England, at-
tending the coronation in 1838, we entered into <u title="negotiations">ne-
gociations</u> in a “high quarter,” to accomplish all
those events, meaning no doubt that we were closet-
ed with Queen Victoria and her cabinet, at Buck-
ingham Palace, for a whole day, on this subject.—
To all this we put our finger on the nose and per-
form the usual gyrations—but on theatrical matters,
Little Biddle of the Sun, has alone furnished us with
the following affidavit, which may be found in his
paper of Saturday last:—
<m9>			[From the Sun.]
   F<small>ANNY</small> E<small>LSSLER AND</small> B<small>ENNETT</small>.—We need not hazard
the conjecture, that Bennett has turned a pretty penny
by Fanny Elssler since her arrival in this country. In-
deed, so little doubt is expressed on this point, that the
only question asked is, “How much has the fellow re-
ceived?” Mad'lle Elssler arrived in this country at an
inauspicious season, both as to time, and as to the condi-
tion of our Theatres. With all her admitted grace and
attractions, she had become in a measure <i>passé</i>, as the
French call it, and her noble and distinguished friends
and admirers performed the last act of grace and kind-
ness, by giving her flattering letters of recommendation
to highly respectable gentlemen in this city. She was
engaged at the Park Theatre at fifty pounds sterling per
night; but Mr. Simpson, alarmed at the time, and ap-
prehensive of the result, offered to share with her night-
ly, after deducting expenses. Mlle. Elssler had with
her, as a friend and agent, a very clever American, re-
spectably connected, who finding every thing unsettled
in the dramatic way, agreed of her engagement. It be-
came necessary, therefore, to <i>conciliate</i> the press, as it is
called—in other words, to <i>bribe</i> it, in order to sustain and
extol the lady. When the question arose, “which is the
press to be bribed?” the agent was unanimously in-
formed that it was the <i>Herald</i>. Accordingly, negotia-
tions were opened with <u title="Bennett">Bennet</u>, for that purpose. Whe-
ther the bribe was to consist of a per centage on her
earnings, or a sum monthly, we, of course, cannot say;
but from the unwavering, constant, and we may add <i>ful-
some</i> praise of the “divine Fanny,” with which his co-
lumns have unceasingly overflowed, we have not a sha-
dow of doubt that the lady has <i>bled</i> to a vast amount for
this foreign renegade. But it has not stopped here. We
are informed that the avaricious scoundrel, placing the
highest value on his <i>puffs</i>, or rather his “protection,”
has succeeded in a more important arrangement. Mrs.
Bennett, we are credibly informed, is in possession of
certain jewels—the presents, no doubt, of crowned heads
and nobility in Europe—which that liberal lady, Md'lle
Elssler, has “in the kindest manner” <i>entreated</i> Mrs. Ben-
nett to accept as a small consideration for her husband's
services and powerful aid—including, now doubt, some-
thing neat and costly for that little squinting monkey
he calls “<i>de jeune editeur</i>.” Of this, probably, we have
no right to complain. “Light come, light go.” When
a fellow is hired, he must be paid; but can there be a
greater indignity to the American press, than to allow
this foreign scoundrel to disgrace it by such acts?</m9>
   Now, setting aside the utter degradation of the
vulgar and vulnerable being, who could bring such
private names into a newspaper controversy about
the character of Ulster and Jacksonville shiplas-
ters—a degradation that can only be paralleled by
that of John O'Sargeant, once of the “Courier,” and
Eppes Sargeant, once of the “Signal,” last year,
when these persons attacked the proprietors of the
Astor House, because we happened to reside there
a few weeks—setting aside this utter, inextinguisha-
ble, eternal degradation and disgrace, which even
“Col. Webb, of the regular army” has too much
manliness to commit—setting aside this unprece-
dented, unrivalled, unequalled disgrace, we consi-
der the statement as further confirmation of the vast
power and influence of this journal—and as a proof
of the good sense of Fanny Elssler in ascertaining as
soon as she set her foot in New York, the right
quarter where existed the power to aid and assist
her through her late brilliant and successful cam-
paign.
   In this campaign, the immortal Fanny has cleared
an aggregate of $100,000, in 18 months—her ex-
penses have been $21,000—leaving her a balance of
$79,000 cash in hand. Of course we suppose that
the Herald's per centage is included in the $21,000,
but how much, we are precluded from saying, be-
cause it is a cabinet secret, as yet the injunction
of <u>secresy</u> not being taken off. Again, as to the
jewels—Fanny has certainly in her possession some
splendid jewelry, worth near <i>half a million of dollars</i>,
which she received from kings, emperors, popes,
nobles and nabobs, throughout Europe. Diamonds,
amethysts, beryls, and every species of precious
stone are in her possession. We presume she may
have presented a tiara of diamonds, worth $15,000
to one personage in this country, and a rattle of em-
eralds worth $4,500 to another personage—besides a
pap spoon, adorned with sparkling brilliants, worth
$6,769 12½ in New York funds. At all events, what-
ever Fanny Elssler has presented in the way of fe-
male ornament, we will venture to say, that these
very jewels will receive more grace, beauty, and
excellence from the receiver than they ever can give
to her. We may say the same of the “young editor”
who is without spot, “squint” or blemish—and if
Beach will wash his face, shave his beard, put on a
clean shirt, and give security in two bonds of $2000
each that he will behave like a gentleman, we can
show him a little boy of seven months old, that in
health, strength, intelligence, grace, and bright blue
eyes, cannot be exceeded in this or any other city,
in this or any other country. Above all he is a Yan-
kee and native American to the back-bone.
   Meantime the divine Fanny reappears at the Park
on Wednesday evening, when she will run through
her former pieces, with the addition of several new
and interesting ballets that have been got up for her.
And further, if Little Biddle will only redeem all
his dirty shin plasters at par, to the poor people of
New York who call hereafter at his office, he shall
have the whole of the per centage Fanny has paid
us for our influence, and a few of the jewels. What
say Beach?

	<b>Mr. J. Fenimore Cooper.</b>
   Instead of the grace which we have for the last
two days been quietly expecting from this gentle-
man, we received yesterday a very courteous and
civil, though not altogether reasonable, letter from
his counsel, Mr. R. Cooper, in relation to our ob-
noxious publication. We should be most happy
to publish this letter, but, considering that it is one
of business and may be regarded by the writer as
a private one, we shall not take the liberty of so
doing. Suffice it, then, that it very civilly calls on
us for a “retraction” of <a class="l" href="#Tribune-1841-11-20">what was said</a>, not by
us, but by our Fonda correspondent, consisting of
a statement of the circumstances attending the
taking of the inquest in the case of Cooper <i>vs.</i>
Weed, and comments thereon. How shall we be
required to retract what another has stated? and
how retract the entire statement, when the great-
er part of it is sustained by Mr. Cooper's own ver-
sion of the matter? Finally, we are required to
retract our correspondent's <i>inference</i> that, the Ju-
ry, in awarding Mr. Cooper but $400 damages for
a libel which was not defended, have settled that
amount as the value of his character. This infer-
ence is either just or unwarranted; if just, it
ought not to be retracted; if unwarranted, it can
do no possible harm to Mr. Cooper. In either
case, we cannot regard it as any more a libel than
if we had called one of his books a failure.
   Mr. Cooper takes hold of the wrong end of
things, and will persist in doing so. If he felt ag-
grieved by any thing we had published, he had only
to write us, pointing out the errors, and we should
have published his letter most cheerfully. This we
do uniformly, as a matter of right and principle,
in every case of alleged grievance from statements
in our columns. Instead of this, the first com-
plaint we have from him reaches us in the Albany
Argus, accompanied by a statement that he has
directed a prosecution to be commenced against
us as libelers!
   This is just the way of correcting the errors of
the Press that we do not admire. Now we cannot
“retract” all our correspondent has stated or in-
ferred; for we do most undoubtingly believe that
Mr. Cooper's course, in pushing his libel suit
against Mr. Weed to a default on the first and then
the second day of the term, while Mr. W. was de-
tained away by the dangerous illness of his family,
was the reverse of honorable or magnanimous.—
Such is our conviction; if a Court and Jury shall
pronounce it a libel, we shall be careful not to <i>say</i>
so again, but we cannot help <i>thinking</i> so all the
time. And now, as the very best <i>amende</i> to Mr.
Cooper that we can make, we publish <i>his own</i> ver-
sion of the affair, which is as follows:

<b>Licentiousness and Murder, or the “connection
		between the vices.”</b>
   The recent fearful developments of crime in this city,
which have sent a thrill to the hearts of thousands
throughout the country, prove clearly what has formerly
been asserted in this paper, by an able correspondent,
that <i>there exists a most intimate connection between the vices</i>.
In the case of the unfortunate Mary C. Rogers, we have
already seen the immediate agency of licentiousness in
causing her death—and while our ears still tingled with
the horrible details, another murder, perpetrated in open
day, in the very heart of the city, furnishes an impressive
commentary on the words of the wisest of men—The
“end” (of a strange woman) “is bitter as wormwood,
sharp as a two-edged sword. Her feet go down to death
—her steps take hold on hell.” “The dead are there,
and her guests are in the depths of hell.” “None that
go unto her return, neither take they hold of the paths of
life.”
   How true has this been in the case of the murderer,
who is now awaiting his trial for a deed of unparalleled
cruelty and guilt! The watch of his victim was found in
the possession of Colt's mistress, and how great may
have been her agency in the dreadful business, by drawing
continually on his resources, none can yet know. One
	...
   There are undoubtedly many who look upon Colt's con-
nection with an abandoned woman, as an item in his his-
tory too unimportant to be regarded in his present cir-
cumstances. But we do not so consider it. True, he is
only one of hundreds living in the same way, who are
still called gentlemen, and in no danger from the penalty
of the law. But no man becomes a hardened villain all
at once; and very few are so in love with crime, for its
own sake, as to commit an act which jeopards their own
lives, without some motive. Now, we believe licentious-
ness, more than any other vice, hardens the heart, sears
the conscience, and prepares the way for the commission
of more open sins. Who that has viewed the sub-
ject attentively and philosophically, can doubt this?
<d>[Col.2]</d>
	...
rising generation! Indeed, almost the only notice taken
of it, is the cool announcement, that the testimony of his
paramour, and probable accomplice, is so important to the
prisoner, as to warrant the delay of his trial one month,
for the purpose of obtaining it. We might say much on
the inconsistency of admitting, in a case of life and death,
the testimony of a woman whom neither judge <u>or</u> jury
would regard as worthy of trust in the most trifling mat-
ter—but we have already exceeded the limits prescribed
to ourself in the commencement of this article. We re-
fer our readers to an extract in the Advocate for Novem-
ber 1st, entitled, “<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=6nQXAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA161">Habit of Lying among Prostitutes</a>,”
for some remarks on this subject, which deserve the se-
rious attention of all classes who have rights to be pro-
tected by the laws.
   There is one more feature in the history of this unhap-

   The “<a class="l" href="#American-1841-11-06">Bachelor's Lament</a>,” by Flaccus, published in
the American a few days back, has called forth the fol-
lowing reply from a correspondent of the Newark Daily
Advertiser:
   Mr. Editor—In yesterday's paper you republished
some “Musings by Flaccus,” entitled “The Bachelor's
Lament.”
<l9>	From which wise strain—constrain'd am I—
	   To draw this sage deducement:
	“Wives are but toys which <i>rich</i> men buy,
	   And marry for amusement.”

	In other words the like to say,—
	   A Wife's more ornamental
	Than useful—at the present day,
	   To one with a small rental.

	In times long past, folks different thought;
	   And lovers rarely tarried;
	But ardently <i>together wrought</i>
	   To live—and soon got married.

	Now, mutual love and toil—are things
	   Found in romantic stories;
	But deep regret her marriage brings
	   To ev'ry dame who poor is!

	Hence, modern Belles reject the man
	   Who only love advances;
	And guided by a cautious plan,
	   They marry Circumstances!</l9>

			<i>For the Evening Post</i>.
		H<small>ALL</small>, Cooperstown, Nov. 25th, 1841.
   M<small>ESSRS</small>. E<small>DITORS</small>.—The Courier of Tuesday,
contains what professes to be an account of the re-
cent trial of James Watson Webb, for a libel on
myself. To all who are acquainted with the man-
ner in which the journal in question is apt to state
facts, in matters affecting its editor, it will scarce-
ly be necessary to say, that this statement is inac-
curate in most of its essentials. Some of these in-
accuracies are of a character that will call for a re-
futation hereafter, but; as it is my intention to give
a history of all these libel trials, I am quite content
to let the matter rest until this history can be given
in connection, and with propriety. I will only say,
here, that Mr. Webb will be tried again in the
spring, unless justice is denied me, a result I nei-
ther anticipate nor apprehend.
<l9>   There is one point, however, which it may be
well to clear up on the spot. Mr. Webb gives an
account of the retraction of the libel, on which the
second indictment was found, with a looseness that
requires explanation. He says, that the District
Attorney entered a <i>nolle prosequi</i> upon his address-
ing him the letter which he publishes. All ac-
quainted with the law, know that the District
Attorney <i>can</i> do no such thing. He must move
the Supreme Court before he has power to enter a
nolle prosequi. But the statement might induce
the public to suppose I had no agency in this affair.
The facts are as follows, viz:—Counsel came to me,
on the part of the District Attorney, to say that Mr.
Webb wished to make an “honorable retraction” of
the libellous matter. After a consultation with
counsel, it was thought that this was the most credit-
able victory we could gain. I asked for a <i>written</i>
proposition. One was sent, which I rejected.
A second was sent, and rejected also. After seve-
ral hours of fruitless negotiation, through the coun-
sel, Mr. Spencer, on behalf of Mr. Webb, came to
my rooms in person, and between us, the letter to
be published was agreed on.
   A large portion of the defence in the case tried,
was made in the <i>opening</i>, which lasted for hours.
I was not present half the time, being compelled to
prepare arguments, &c. for my own counsel, on
whom the duty of summing up was suddenly
thrown by the judge, just as the trial commenced,
in consequence of the defendants objecting to my
being permitted to sum up, as the court had pre-
viously said I might. I, therefore, state on hearsay;
but I am told that Mr. Jordan occupied several
hours in trying to convince the jury I had endea-
vored to glorify myself in the character of Mr. Ef-
fingham. Two modes were adopted to sustain this
charge; one by stating facts, that it was said would
be subsequently proved; and the other, by reading
description of Mr. Effingham, from the book.—
Take an example of what I mean. Mr. Jordan
commenced by saying that Mr. Effingham sailed
from England on such a day, and that he was fifty
years old the day he embarked, and that he had
been twelve years abroad, &c. &c. “Now, gentle-
men, we will show you that Mr. Cooper embarked
from England at the time mentioned in the book,
and that he was then about fifty years old, and that
he had been abroad the same period, &c. &c. All
this was to prove the identity, and to prejudice the
jurors. After working in this manner, in the
<i>opening</i>, for ten or twelve hours, the judge decided
that all the matter relative to the identity between
Mr. Cooper and Mr. Effingham, was not pertinent
to the issue, and we were precluded <i>from disproving
it, as we could have done, by direct and unanswer-
able testimony</i>. Thus, I did not sail from England
in the autumn of 1835, as is stated of Mr. Effing-
ham, but in 1833; I was not absent twelve years,
but less than eight; nor was I fifty when I embark-
ed, but just forty-four years and twelve days old,
having been born in 1789. My motive for alluding
to these particular circumstances is as follows:
   You well know, that a wide-spread attempt has
been made to persuade the public that I wished to
represent, or rather to misrepresent myself in the
character of Mr. Effingham. Perhaps there is not
a case in the annals of literature, in which one of
these imaginary resemblances has been supposed to
exist, that is susceptible of being so triumphantly
disproved as this between myself and Edward
Effingham. Of course, I have known this from the
first, but have refrained from doing anything in the
premises on two accounts. One is, the most pas-
sive feeling of the human mind, contempt for the
asses who could believe it. The other was a respect
for justice, whose decision I did not wish to in-
fluence extra-judicially. As a court has now dis-
tinctly said, that this identity has nothing to do with
the issue to be tried, I shall take an early occasion
to ask a column or two in one of the large weeklies,
and dispose of this resemblance in a way that I
think will leave it no believers. I shall do this, in
order to have a fair trial next spring.
   It is due to Judge Willard to say, that the charge
given by the Courier, resembles the charge actually
given by the court, on this occasion, about as much
as the logic of the Courier and Enquirer usually re-
sembles that of Locke.
	Yours, respectfully,
			J. FENIMORE COOPER.</l9>

   <i>The Mild, the Amiable, the Dignified, and the Hand-
some Mr. Effingham</i>.—If there are any who doubt
that this notorious individual is laboring under a
most lamentable <i>monomania</i> in all that regards him-
self, his recent letter to the <i>Albany Argus</i> giving
notice that he had prosecuted the <i>Evening Journal</i>
and <i>Tribune</i> for libels, and the annexed letter which
we find in the <i>Post</i> of last evening, should forever
settle the question.
   Vain, arrogant, and foolish in all that relates to
himself, Mr. J. <u>F<small>ENNIMORE</small></u> C<small>OOPER</small> is the veriest
<i>egotist</i> that ever made himself the laughing stock of
an intelligent community. His vanity however, we
could tolerate, were it not that he seeks to indulge
it at the expense of his country and countrymen, and
by slandering in “Home as Found” all classes and
conditions of society in the United States. This we
may not, will not tolerate; and neither courts nor
juries, indictments nor civil actions, shall ever deter
us from holding up Mr. C<small>OOPER</small> as the author of the
most wholesale libel on America and Americans, that
we have met with.
   In the report of our recent trial at Fonda and
triumph over Mr. C<small>OOPER</small>, we treated him with more
than usual respect, because we looked upon him as
a man in adversity—one who had been prostrated,
humbled, condemned by an American Jury out of
his own Books. We reflected upon what his posi-
tion once <i>was</i>—contrasted it with what it now is—
and pitied, truly and sincerely pitied the poor mono-
maniac, whose egotism and vanity had so humbled
him in public estimation. <i>Contempt</i> we did not feel
for an author who had written good and praiseworthy
works; and who, before he had become ashamed of
his humble ancestry, was an honor to our country.
Even now, when his egotism has caused him to forget
the very first duty of a gentleman, and he grossly and
palpably, not only suppresses the <i>truth</i> but wilfully
and deliberately pens a <i>falsehood</i>, we cannot feel con-
tempt for the author of the <i>Pioneers</i>, much as we ex-
perience that feeling for the monomaniac whose
whole course is calculated to render him an object of
pity. In common with the reading public, we <i>pity</i>
the egregious vanity of the <i>author</i> which prompts a
resort to <i>falsehood</i>, and the <i>pusillanimity</i> of the <i>man</i>
which drives the coward blood from his blanching
cheek when his falsehoods are exposed by those who
ever hold themselves responsible for their acts.
   We regret that we have not room in our columns
to review to-day, this last epistle from “the Hand-
some Mr. E<small>FFINGHAM</small>”; but we shall do so next
week, and if we mistake not, his friends will be well
pleased to enter in his behalf the plea of <i>monomania</i>,
to screen him from the charge of being the most mi-
serable coiner of deliberate falsehoods, of any Ame-
rican who ever claimed to be considered a <i>gentleman</i>.

<i>To the Editors of the Evening Post</i>:
   In Mr. J. Fenimore Cooper's note, published in

	...
think will leave it no believers.” As “the New
World” is one of the largest of “the large week-
lies,” and as it has nearly double the circulation of
either of them, I take the liberty to offer the use of
one, two, or a dozen columns to Mr. Cooper, for the
purpose he specifies. I am led to do this, because
the charge of Mr. Cooper's identity with Mr. Ed-
ward Effingham has been made in that journal, and
because I now am, as I always have been, quite
ready to publish any correction of misstatements
concerning Mr. Cooper. I have judged of him on-
ly by his books and by his public acts; and, if those
have led me to form a wrong opinion of his person-
al character, and to impart that opinion to my
readers, I shall be happy to publish his “plea,” as
widely as I have disseminated my “declaration.”

   <i>Trial for abduction, with intent to commit a rape</i>.—Tho-
mas Moore, one of the young rowdies concerned in en-
deavoring to ravish Jane Ann Toole, in July last, was
put on his trial.
   J<small>AMES</small> <u title="McCalvin (below)">McA<small>LVIN</small></u> was sworn, and deposed that on the
<u>4</u>th of July last, between 2 and 3 o'clock, there were
some ladies with us at the cave at Hoboken, and the pri-
soner said, pointing to the ladies, “there goes three old
cats,” at which the brother of Jane Ann Toole knocked
him down—prisoner then asked some of his companions
to go and get the other boats. I then proposed to leave the
shore, when Ann Toole asked me to let her get into my
boat, which I agreed to, and we then started to go to the
city—immediately after three boats came up, and Fran-
cis Moore jumped into my boat and beat me. Francis
Moore then swore if she did not get out of my boat they
would sink the boat—he then said, wait until my brother
Thomas comes up, and get satisfaction. He came up in
another boat, but did not get out—after taking Ann out,
the three boats went off together towards the big rock.—
I told them to take satisfaction out of me, but not to hurt
the girl.
   Cross-examined.—I went over with Mrs. Smith, to
take care of the boat. I took Jane Ann Toole and her
mother and father to Hoboken, also Mr. and Mrs.
Smith and the engineer of the foundry. I was out of
low water mark when they attacked me in the boat.
   George Hawkes, impleaded with the prisoner, was
then sworn. On the <u>25</u>th of July, myself with some
others, went to Hoboken in a row boat, and while cross-
ing we saw a boat containing a man, that several persons
from another boat alongside were beating—we went to
the boat to see fair play, and afterwards saw a girl in
the boat with <u>Francis Thomas</u>—the girl did not ask ei-
ther one of us in our boat to protect her or take her out;
when asked, <u>Frank Thomas</u> said he was going up the
river—the girl was not in our boat any time—the per-
sons with me were Wm. Robbins, James Sherrod, Ben-
jamin <u title="Hadly (elsewhere)">Hadley</u>, and Austin Rankin—we landed on the
shore some one hundred yards above the boat in which
<u>Frank Thomas</u> was.
   Jane Ann Toole was then sworn and deposed that six
of us went over to Mr. Ludlow's and then went to Ste-
ven's, where we got some oysters, and there met some
boys, and among them was Thomas Moore, the prisoner
—he called three of us “old cats,” when my brother
struck him—immediately afterwards several boats came
down, and being frightened I asked <u title="McAlvin (above)">McCalvin</u> to let me
get into his boat, which he did—as soon as we were out
in the river some distance three boats came up, and Fran-
cis Moore and some of the others in one of the boats
beat <u>McCalvin</u> and compelled me to get into their boat
—they said they would sink the boat if I didn't—after
Frank Moore had beat him he said wait till my brother
comes up and he'll get his revenge—when Thomas came
up he said that Frank had beat him enough for satisfaction;
after getting into the boat I asked him if he did not intend
to take me home, he said he would or he'd eat my hat, they
then took me up to Bull's ferry on the Jersey shore.—
They then took me ashore up in the woods and there they
used violence with me; the prisoner was with them at
the time; afterwards they put me in the boat and cross-
ed over to the Glass House; they there compelled me to
get out of the boat and abused me a second time, when
the prisoner said they had done enough to me; the name
of the boat was “Echo”—I had been there ten or twen-
ty minutes before <u title="Thomas ?">John</u> Moore said they had done enough
to me; they had me down on the ground and done all
they could to me; <u>John</u> Moore said he had connection
with me once—he told the girls in the prison so; he
had connection with me on the New York side, and they
all had against my will; I hallooed murder once or
twice.
   [At this point the District Attorney enquired of wit-
ness whether she was abused while ashore there? And
contended that the question was relevant to show the in-
tent to commit a rape.]

	...
   Thomas Moore, impleaded with several others, was then
put upon his trial for abduction with intent to ravish and
defile Jane Ann Toole, on the <u>4</u>th of July last.
   James <u title="McAlpin (below)">McAlvin</u> deposed that after being at <u>Stevens</u>, at
the cave, in Hoboken, the prisoner called Miss Toole and
other girls an indecent name, and her brother knocked
him down; that Moore then told some one to go and get
the other boats to come down; and after the girl and her
mother and another girl took a walk, when witness, hear-
ing them threaten to stove his boat, rowed out into the
river, and soon after Jane came running down, being
frightened and saying she wished to get into the boat, and
he took her in and rowed towards the New-York shore;
that other boats then approached, in one of which prison-
er was, and his brother, Francis Moore, boarding the boat,
gave <u>McAlvin</u> a terrible beating, and threatened to sink
the boat unless he was suffered to take the girl, and she
was forced to enter the boat, and they rowed off with her
up the river and landed with her. The boys were chas-
ing Miss Toole, and threatened her before they started
for this city. The prisoner did not enter the boat of wit-
ness.
   George Hawks, one of the accused, witnessed that he
saw the girl in the boat with Francis Moore and others,
but is not certain the prisoner was in the boat. He cor-
roborated the stronger part of the other witness.
   Jane Ann Toole deposed to being at Hoboken with her
mother; that the prisoner called them bad names, when
her brother knocked him down; that she and her mother
and another girl took a walk, got frightened by the chas-
ing of young men, ran off from her mother, got on board
the boat with <u title="McAlvin (above)">McAlpin</u>, was rowed out into the river,
when three boats came up, in which were Frank Moore
and his brother, with three others. Frank got on board
the boat she was in, beat <u>McAlpin</u> terribly, threatened to
upset the boat unless she went with them, and she did.—
Prisoner was urged by his brother to beat <u>McAlpin</u>, but
refused. They then rowed her up the river to Bull's
Ferry, landed, took her into a retired place in the woods,
and there held and all outraged and abused her, when
prisoner said they had kept her long enough. They then
went off in the boat, took her with them, landed near the
Glass-House, and again all outraged her person, including
the prisoner. After this they suffered her to go home.
   Benjamin <u title="Hadley (elsewhere)">Hadly</u> corroborated in part the testimony of
the three other witnesses, and the prosecution rested.
   The defence commenced at 5 o'clock, and two witnesses
named George Creighton and Peter Steward deposed to
most of the facts stated by the former witnesses, but said
that the prisoner did not participate in the taking of the
girl from the boat, and that she was taken to Bull's Ferry
into the woods; but said there was nothing improper done
to her as far as they knew.
   For the prosecution, Mrs. <u title="Phoebe">Phœbe</u> Smith, mother of Miss
Toole, deposed to the facts as stated by her daughter up
to the time of her being taken from the boat and carried
up the river, and finally of her return home.
   The case was summed up by Mr. Benedict for the de-
fence, and by Mr. Shaler for the people; and, after a
charge from Judge Lynch, the jury retired, and returned
with a verdict of guilty.

Jane Ann <s title="Toole">Foole</s>, a girl aged 15 years, with the intent to ravish
her, on the <u>4</u>th of July last. The occurrence took place in the

that the prisoner took no active part in the outrage, which was
sworn to by the complainant, who also swore that after they ar-
rived on this side of the river the same outrage was repeated on
her person. The prisoner has since acknowledged that he was
engaged in the affair. The Court here took a recess until 5 o'-
clock.

   <i>Execution of Patrick Russell</i>.—The sentence of
the law was carried out upon this miserable man
yesterday, in the Court yard of the City Prison, in
the presence of a large number of persons whose cu-
riosity to witness such a scene had drawn them thith-
er. The prisoner was attended to the gallows by the
Rev. Messrs. Curran and <u title="McDonough (elsewhere)">McDowall</u>, and maintained
the same stupid indifference which had characterized
his conduct since his conviction, up to the last mo-
ment. After hanging about fifteen minutes the body
was lowered into a handsome mahogany coffin
provided by his friends, and was taken off by them,
for the purpose of interring it in the Catholic bury-
ing ground.

   T<small>HE</small> E<small>XECUTION OF</small> P<small>ATRICK</small> R<small>USSELL</small>, for the mur-
der of his wife, in June last, took place yesterday in
the rear avenue of the city prison. He was attended
at an early hour, in his cell, by the Rev. Dr. Curran,
and the Rev. Mr. <u title="McDowall (elsewhere)">McDonough</u>, Catholic clergymen,
who remained with him until the execution. The
gallows used was the same on which Coleman, the
negro, was hung, for the murder of his wife, in
Broadway, by cutting her throat in the street. It
consisted merely of two upright posts, and one
transversely placed. Through the centre of the
transverse piece, over a <u title="pulley">pully</u> wheel, the rope was
passed, and to the opposite end five fifty-six pound
weights were suspended by additional blocks and
tackle. It was placed in the centre of the yard,
and immediately opposite the rear window of the
cell in which Colt is confined, he therefore having
a view of the whole ceremony by raising himself to
the top of the window, which we understand he did!
A few minutes previous to the hour fixed for the exe-
cution, the prisoner's coffin was brought in and placed
on the side of the gallows. It was neatly made, and
had been provided by his brother-in-law, Mr. Logue.
   The time drawing near, the officers stationed them-
selves in front of the pavement, on each side of the
avenue, forming a line enclosing the persons present,
who numbered about 150. Every thing being in
readiness, and his spiritual advisers having informed
the Sheriff that he was prepared, a procession was
formed at the outer door of the prison, consisting of
the Sheriff, Monmouth B. Hart, Esq.; the Under
Sheriff, John I. Westervelt, Esq., in full black dress,
with swords and chapeaus, followed by the twelve
citizens, selected by law to witness the execution,
and Deputy Sheriffs appointed for the occasion, and
a number of other persons. Previous to leaving the
cell, the short rope, with the noose, was placed
around his neck by the under Sheriff, John I. Wes-
tervelt, Esq., and directions given him not to move
his head while under the gallows, as it would change
the position of the rope, and thus cause him to
struggle much before life was extinct. He obeyed
these injunctions explicitly while under the gallows.
He was clad in a white muslin frock coat and
pantaloons, trimmed with black braid, and a white
cap, also trimmed and ornamented with a tassel.—
At twenty minutes before eleven he left his cell, and
proceeded in procession around the centre building
to the gallows. The Rev. Drs. Curran and M'Do-
nough walking on each side of him, and the Sheriff
and Under Sheriff leading the procession, followed
by a number of citizens, Deputy Sheriffs and
Police Officers. The prisoner evinced no emo-
tion on perceiving the gallows, but walked slowly
and steadily forward without support until he
reached it, and then knelt by the side of his
coffin with the clergymen. He held a crucifix
in his hand and his face appeared of a livid hue.
On kneeling his whole frame trembled with emotion.
He then joined the Rev. Dr. Curran in prayer,
still holding the crucifix in his hands with his
eyes intently fixed upon it. On the response being de-
livered by Dr. McDonough, he appeared to repeat it in
a low tone, and on concluding he pronounced audi-
bly the word A<small>MEN</small>. This was the only loud word
spoken by the wretched man, after leaving his cell.
The Reverend clergymen then kissed him on the
cheek, and he rose with their aid and took his stand
beneath the rope. At this point he evinced no particu-
<d>[Col.5]</d>
lar sensibility or emotion. The sheriff, aided by his de-
puty, having previously placed the noose around his
neck, then attached the upper end to the hook lead-
ing from the main rope. The Rev. Dr. Curran here
stepped forward, and whispered in the prisoner's
ear, “<i>O merciful God, have mercy on my soul for
Christ's sake</i>,” which Russell continued to mutter.
At this moment, twenty-five minutes before 11, the
cap was drawn, the rope sustaining the weights cut
by the under sheriff, and in an instant the unfortu-
nate man was suspended between heaven and earth.
Not a movement of the body was perceptible for
nearly a minute, when a slight shudder passed over
it that shook the gallows frame; this was followed
by several convulsive efforts, which continued at
intervals for upwards of six minutes, when the vital
spark appeared to be extinct. Dr. Curran continued
reading prayers until the last gleam of life ap-
<l9>peared to have departed, when he retired with his
associate. Although his hands were partially grasp-
ed immediately after he was drawn up, yet from the
fact that the ends of the fingers on each had been
frozen off some years since, the crucifix and hand-
kerchief that he had held dropped to the ground on
the third convulsive movement. The body remained
forty-eight minutes on the gallows, when it was
lowered down and placed in the coffin, the lid of
which was put on without removing the cap from
his face. His remains were then handed over to his
friends for burial in the new Catholic ground, cor-
ner of Eleventh street and Second Avenue, the fu-
neral of which takes place this morning. He main-
tained, throughout the whole ceremony, the same
apparent insensibility that has characterised him
form the time of his trial, and although penitent and
satisfied of the justice of his sentence, yet he died
as one feeling no apparent solicitude as for his
fate. His two children, both girls, one aged four
and a half years and the other three, visited him in
his cell on Monday, for the first time since his incar-
ceration, and though it has been only since June
last, he did not recognise them as belonging to him.
The eldest one ran out of the cell, at first stating
that she was afraid of him, “because he looked
so wild,” but the youngest remained until he came
to his recollection, when he wept over them with
considerable demonstration of feeling.
   An application was made to the sheriff for the
use of his body to experiment upon by the galvanic
battery, but owing to the omission of Judge Kent in
his sentence to authorize the delivery of it to the phy-
sicians, and the application of his friends to obtain it
for burial, the sheriff delivered it to his brother-in-
law, Mr. Logue, who took it in charge, and remo-
ved it from the prison yesterday at 2 o'clock.
   Dr. Cornelius B. Archer, and Dr. James H. Hart
attended as physicians during the execution, by the
request of the sheriff, and we cannot close this no-
tice without alluding to the orderly manner in which
the whole ceremony was conducted, both on the
part of the sheriff as well as the persons assembled.
The prisoner's counsel, Henry M. Western, Esq.,
was present, and in alluding to the scene, observed
that the sheriff had so well performed his duty that
the prisoner must have died in the most easy man-
ner that such a death could possibly be effected.
   It will be remembered that the law compelling
the execution of prisoners within the jail yard,
makes it incumbent on the sheriff to summon two
Judges of the Court of Sessions, two physicians,
and twelve citizens to witness the execution and
give a certificate that the penalty of the law was
properly put in force at the time selected. He there-
fore summoned the gentlemen whose names are at-
tached to the following certificate for that purpose.</l9>

made and provided. We further certify, that we were
present at such execution, and that the prisoner, the
said Patrick Russell, was executed at the hour of ten
o'clock and thirty-five minutes, A. M.

<l9>   An occurrence took place in front of the prison,
while the execution was going on, that created con-
siderable sensation. It appears that Mr. Hubbard
Sice, a brother-in-law of Sheriff Hart, made appli-
cation at the jail door for admission, but, the pri-
soner having left his cell, he concluded it was too
late to witness the execution, and immediately
stepped out of the prison entrance on Franklin street,
and was accosted by Mr. Thomas Day, who remark-
ed to him that he had applied at a late hour. He
answered in the affirmative and, turning round, fell
headlong to the side walk. The force of the fall
caused a profuse flow of blood from his nose, and
upon raising him up, it was found that he had been
attacked with a fit of apoplexy. He was imme-
diately conveyed across Centre street to the hotel
kept by John Garland, and placed in the back room,
where every attention was rendered him by the in-
mates of the premises. Some fifteen minutes elapsed
before a physician could be obtained, when Drs.
Smith, Wood and Pennel arrived, who were joined
by Drs. Hart and Archer immediately after the exe-
cution had terminated, and every means was resort-
ed to to restore his life, but without effect. He re-
mained in a state of insensibility until 6 o'clock last
evening, when death terminated his agonizing con-
vulsions. Truly may we say—“in the midst of life
we are in death.”

D<small>ROWNING</small>—A M<small>ARY</small> R<small>OGERS</small> C<small>ASE IN</small> B<small>OSTON</small>.—
A young woman named A<small>NN</small> <u title="McKinnister (elsewhere)">McA<small>LLISTER</small></u> was
found drowned in the Canal near Traverse street,
on Tuesday night, under circumstances which lead
to the belief that she was murdered.
   The history of this melancholy affair, as we
learn it from the officers of the Police, and others
acquainted with the facts, is as follows. The
young woman is a native of Ellsworth, Maine.
Her parents were respectable persons, and are said
to be still living. She came to this city about six
years since. She was then scarcely sixteen years
of age, and was extremely beautiful and intelligent.
He parents had paid much attention to her educa-
tion, and she was well fitted by her natural grace of
manners, and her acquirements, to be an ornament
to society.
   She came to this city by invitation of a female
friend, who promised to aid her in learning a trade.
This friend unfortunately died in about a year af-
terwards, and Miss McAllister was thrown abroad
upon the world, without a protector to guard her
from the snares which beset her path. Being of
an affectionate and confiding character, she natu-
rally won the esteem of her female associates, and
the grace and beauty of her person, attracted the
attention of the other sex. She received many in-
vitations to balls and parties, which she readily
accepted, and her brilliant appearance was the
theme of conversation wherever she appeared.
Hundreds of young people who read this sketch,
will remember a tall, graceful, dark-eyed girl, with
long raven curls, and a step of pride—a wild, laugh-
ing creature—who delighted to dress in blue Turk-
ish robes, and green velvet, and always wore a large
garnet gem upon her brow, secured with a chain of
small white pearls. She was the toast of clubs,
and the bell of every general ball, for more than
three years.
   Among the number of gay gallants who fluttered
about her, was one who is now supposed to have
been her murderer, if she died by other hands than
her own. The name of this man is well known to
the Police, and is common talk in the streets, yet
sufficient is not know to justify us in giving, to the
world. It is said that the unfortunate girl was en-
gaged to be married to a young artist in this city,
when the brute, who is supposed to have caused her
death, fixed his eye upon her, and determined to
accomplish her ruin. He whispered false stories
in the ear of her lover, and excited his jealousy by
various stratagems, until he finally brought on a
quarrel between them, and by pretending to take
the part of the woman, won her confidence, and
gained access to her heart. She felt grateful to
him for his pretended protection, and not knowing
his villainous character, admitted him to her
society.
   Her utter and irretrievable ruin soon followed.
She left her trade, and lived as the mistress of her
vile seducer—lost her standing in society—and in-
stead of being the toast and admiration of clubs
and drawing rooms, she was a mark “for scorn to
point her slow, unmoving finger at.”
   About three weeks ago, the vile wretch who ef-
fected the ruin of this beautiful and accomplished
girl, turned her off upon the town, and refused
any longer to contribute to her support. Driven
to desperation by her unhappy condition, the mis-
erable girl sought relief for her sorrows in the in-
toxicating cup, and the means of subsistence by
visiting the theatre—the last sad refuge of the
abandoned. In one of the recent midnight expedi-
tions made by Marshall Blake, with the Captain of
the Watch, among the haunts of these miserable
beings, the chamber occupied by the deceased was
broken open, but no person was discovered with
her, and she was so beautiful and so interesting,
even in her ruin, that the officers concluded to
spare her the disgrace of a public exposure at the
Police.
   Since that night, she has been frequently seen at
the theatre, and always in a high state of intoxica-
tion. It is said by those who pretend to know,
that she took great quantities of opium to stupify
her senses, and render her less susceptible to her
horrid fate. On Tuesday night she attended the
theatre, and was observed to be unusually wild
and strange in her appearances. She told one of the
officers that she had had some difficulty with her
seducer, and that he had sworn to be revenged
upon her. The man himself told another person
the same story about the difficulty, and said he
meant to be rid of “the nuisance,” as he had form-
ed another connection. When the poor girl left
the theatre, she asked the officer to go down with
her and see that she was not assaulted at the door,
but he declined. She went out, and soon after
several persons ran up and called the officer, and
told him there was a <u title="row (elsewhere)">rew</u> at the door about a lady
who was getting into a hack. He went down im-
mediately, but the hack had gone. Who went
away in it we have not been unable to learn. But, in
a short time afterwards, a lad who has been found
by Coroner Shute, saw a man standing on the small
bridge which crosses the canal near Traverse
street, holding a woman by the wrists. He heard
the woman cry “let go of me!” two or three
times, with great earnestness, and in a few min-
utes both parties disappeared. His description of
<d>[Col.6]</d>
these persons agrees very nearly with that of the
girl and her seducer; but he cannot testify posi-
tively to the identity of either. The body of the
young <u title="woman">womon</u> was afterwards found in the canal,
and an inquest was held upon it yesterday, by
Coroner Shute. A number of persons were call-
ed, but no material facts were elicited; but there
was so much that was mysterious in the circum-
stances, that the matter was left open for further
investigation.—<i>Boston Mail, Dec.</i> 9.

SUPPOSED MURDER OF A YOUNG WOMAN
   BY DROWNING—A MARY ROGERS CASE
   IN BOSTON.
   A young woman named Mary McAllister was found

   William Roberts, impleaded with Thomas Moore, (now

dicment charging him and them with the abduction of
Jane Ann Toole, a young girl of less than 15 years of
age, with intent to ravish and defile her, by taking her
forcibly out of a boat in the Hudson River, off Hoboken,
then taking her to the <u title="woods near">woodsn ear</u> Bull's Ferry, and vio-
lating her person there, on Sunday afternoon, the <u>25</u>th of

the same generally as that in the case of <u title="Thomas ?">Francis</u> Moore,
which was published as far as propriety would permit,
we shall forbear to repeat it. Suffice it, however, to say
that the violation of the person of the girl at Bull's Fer-
ry, in common with others concerned, was proved against
the prisoner; but that he being in another boat, did not
participate in the taking the girl out of the boat, and did
not return in the boat with Francis Moore and the girl to
the city from Bull's Ferry, but came back in the boat
with a man named <u title="Hadley (elsewhere)">Hadly</u>, landing at the foot of Spring-
street, and did not participate in the second violation of
the girl on this side of the river. It was also proved that
when Roberts heard of the accusation against him, he
voluntarily gave himself to officer Lester. The case was
summed up for defence by Mr. James McKeon, and by
Mr. Shaler for the prosecution. Judge Lynch charged
the jury, who found the prisoner not guilty. On motion
of Mr. Shaler, he was remanded to prison as a fugitive
from justice from New-Jersey, to be there tried for the
rape committed in that State.

   M<small>YSTERIOUS</small>—S<small>USPICION OF</small> M<small>URDER</small>.—On
Tuesday night, the body of a woman of the town,
named Ann <u title="McAllister (elsewhere)">McKinnister</u>, alias Jane Steele, alias
Clark, was found in Mill Creek, near the site of
one of the bridges. Yesterday there were vari-
ous rumours in circulation about the affair. One
was that near midnight a man and a woman were
seen walking together near the bridge—then a
woman's voice was heard saying—“Let go my
wrist.” Suddenly a splash and piercing cry were
heard, and a man was seen to move rapidly from
the bridge. The neighbors near the scene heard
some noise, obtained lights, and found the body,
which they took into a house, and endeavoured to
<u title="resuscitate">resusitate</u> it, but in vain. It is known that she
had a quarrel in the third row of the Nation-

herself, and at the same time stated to the of-
ficer that she wanted to get away for fear the
person alluded to should find her and beat her.—

Before the Recorder, Judge Lynch and Aldermen Purdy
			and Bradhurst.
   Austin Rankin, impleaded with Thomas Moore (now
convicted), Francis Moore, James Sharrott, William Rob-
erts and others, was put upon his trial for the abduction
with intent to ravish and defile Jane Ann Toole by forci-
bly taking her from a boat in the Hudson River, carrying
her to the woods near Bull's Ferry, and there violating
her, on the afternoon of the <u>25</u>th of July last. The testi-
mony in this case having been published on the trial of
Thomas Moore, will not be repeated here. Mr. Shaler,
acting District Attorney, proposed to prove the consum-
mation of the outrage at Bull's Ferry, New-Jersey, out of
the jurisdiction of this Court, to show the <i>quo animo</i> or
previous criminal intent of the accused, which Messrs.
Rudd and Josiah Merritt, of counsel for prisoner, objected
to and the Court sustained the objection, confining the
counsel of the People, first, to a proof of the participation
of the accused in the abduction of the girl from the boat.
There was no proof of his having participated in the origi-
nal abduction, and the Court then allowed proof of the ac-
tual violation of the girl near Bull's Ferry, in New-Jersey,
and it was proved that he was the first person that out-
raged her person there. It was also proved that the pris-
oner came in <u>Hadley</u>'s boat to within hailing distance
after the girl was taken out of the boat, and then followed
up to the scene of the outrage, in which he was a promi-
nent actor. The case for the prisoner was summed up
for the accused by Messrs. T. Rudd and Josiah Merritt,
and by Mr. Shaler with ability and energy for the People.
Judge Lynch charged the jury, who retired and returned
into Court with a verdict of guilty.

   S<small>UPPOSED</small> M<small>URDERER OF</small> M<small>ARY</small> C. R<small>OGERS</small> A<small>RREST-
ED</small>.—Among the arrests made of suspicious persons,
supposed to have been guilty of the murder of this
girl, none has created more interest, or presented
as much evidence calculated to prove guilt, as a re-
cent case before the Mayor. A few days after the
body of Mary C. Rogers was found, in the North
River, a person, residing in this city by the name
of E<small>DWARD</small> C. S<small>ANDELL</small>, formerly engaged in the
dry goods business, was missing, with his family, and
subsequent inquiries on the part of the public autho-
rities, led them to suspect that he was acquainted
with the fate of this unfortunate girl. His where-
abouts, for a length of time, was unknown, but the
vigilance of the police was such as to ascertain it a
few days since, and measures were immediately ta-
ken for his arrest. Having in the early part of this
transaction felt a deep interest for the discovery of
those guilty of the crime, we were then made ac-
quainted with the suspicions of the police, and con-
sequently kept a close eye to their movements. We
had even allowed our curiosity to lead us to ascer-
tain the precise spot where S<small>ANDELL</small> had removed
himself and family, which was in a retired cottage
in Bergen county, New Jersey, located in a neigh-
borhood where suspicion would hardly dare to
breathe its taint, and where he, in all probability, if
guilty, presumed that the searching eyes of the po-
lice would never prompt them to visit. Keeping our
Argus-eyed police reporter on the watch, he acci-
dentally discovered Justice Taylor, of the upper po-
lice, and officer A. M. C. Smith, of vision keen,
crossing the Jersey ferry on one of the evenings of
the latter part of last week, in a close carriage, in
company with S<small>ANDELL</small>, and knowing that some-
thing was in the wind, he set his wits to work to as-
certain the result, which proved as follows:—
   Sandell had been arrested on suspicion of the
murder of Mary C. Rogers, at Hoboken, on Sunday,
July 25th. He was fully examined before the Mayor,
and, although it was shown that he was at Hoboken
on the day above mentioned, in company with a
girl resembling Mary Rogers in every particular,
both of dress and person; and, although, he admit-
ted that he was there on that day with a young lady,
yet he gave no clear explanation as to who she was,
or why he was with her! He neither explained in
a satisfactory manner the cause of his leaving the
city, and settling himself in the secluded spot select-
ed, or why his absence was called for at the partic-
ular period alluded to above.
   He proved by several persons, that he was in this
city from 5 to 11 o'clock, on Sunday evening, July
25th, and that he was seen in company with his wife
on the same evening, at 9 o'clock. The evidence
offered to prove an alibi was conclusive, so far as re-
gards his presence in the city that evening, but un-
less an explanation is given as to who the young
lady was that he was seen with at Hoboken on that
memorable day, we fear that it will be difficult for
him to eradicate the suspicions that have already
been created against him. The examination is not
yet concluded, and we trust that Mr. Sandell will be
able to explain every thing to the entire satisfaction
of his Honor, the Mayor, and the public.

paroxysm of rage, produced from rum, he threw a
girl named Eliza Moffatt, who was living in his
house, into the fire, by which means she was so se-
verely burned that her recovery is now considered
doubtful, and on the 11th inst. he threw his wife up-
on the floor, and while in that posture, took a can-
dle <i>and set her clothes on fire</i>, the result of which was
that the poor woman is now lying at the point of
death. He was arrested yesterday, and committed
to answer for his brutal treatment.</f></l9>

   The Court of Oyer and Terminer, and Circuit
Court, opened yesterday, Judge Kent, and Alder-
men Purdy, Benson, and Lee on the Bench.
   While waiting for the hour to arrive at which the
Jury had been summoned, the Court inquired of the
District Attorney if any business was ready.
   That officer replied that they were ready to pro-
ceed with the trial of Mr. Wiley.
   Mr. Price, one of his counsel, said they were not
prepared to-day, on the part of the accused.
	...</f>
   C<small>ASE OF</small> J<small>OHN</small> C. C<small>OLT</small>.—Mr. Morrill, one of the
Counsel for prisoner, requested permission to read an
affidavit relative to the absence, in this case, of a most
important witness. He then read the affidavit of
Charles H. <u title="Brekenham (elsewhere)">Bibighans</u>, a physician of Philadelphia,
taken before Justice George Griscom, of that City,
which states that he is acquainted with Caroline M.
Henshaw—that she was delivered of a male child on
the 17th day of Dec. inst.—that her health, was
good as can reasonably be expected under such cir-
cumstances, but she must necessarily be confined to
her room or dwelling for some time, but in all proba-
bility may be unable to travel with safety at the end of
five or six weeks from this time. This deponent fur-
ther says that the said Caroline M. Henshaw is of
delicate constitution and cannot possibly leave for
New York at this time, or even submit to an exami-
nation as a witness in the above mentioned case (the
People <i>vs.</i> Colt) without great risk to her health, and
possibly her life.
   Mr. Morrill said he would therefore move that the
trial be postponed to next term.
   The District Attorney replied that this case was
put off from last term with the express understand-
ing that a commission should issue in relation to this
witness, if such was found to be necessary.
	...
   The Court stated that it was necessary the trial
should be proceeded with at as early a day as possi-
ble, even if this testimony is taken by commission.
It would not do to keep the same jury here for 4 or
5 weeks.
	...
   <i>Judge Kent</i>.—The Court decides that this day
three weeks be set down for the trial of John C. Colt.
If, in the mean time, it is ascertained that the witness
in question cannot come here, her testimony may be
taken by commission.
   The trial was accordingly set down for Monday,
17th.
	...
   C<small>ASE OF</small> J<small>AMES</small> G<small>ORDON</small> B<small>ENNETT</small>.—The District
Attorney moved that the trial of James Gordon Ben-
nett for libels on the Judges of the Court of Sessions,
and on Judge Noah individually, be set down for
Thursday week.
	...
   It was finally set down, agreeably to the motion of
the District Attorney for Thursday week, with intim-
ation that it could be further postponed at that time
if found to be necessary.

<b>Court of Oyer and Terminer—December
			Term.</b>
   There was a most tremendous crowd yesterday,
in the Court of Oyer and Terminer, to hear and see
the various important proceedings that were expec-
ted to take place. The Court Room has undergone
a most astonishing improvement; and evidently
shows that there has been a most important change
in the presiding genius of the place.
   A new round table, covered with green cloth has
been placed in front of the bench, for the accommo-
dation of the bar. The bench itself has been greatly
improved; carpets have been placed upon and around
it; and immediately behind it have been placed beau-
tiful mahogany cabinet book cases, containing law
books of reference, for the use of the Judges. The
reporters also have two new tables, admirably situ-
ated for hearing and seeing; and the Jurors have
now large easy arm chairs—a great desideratum.—
The whole arrangement reflects great credit on the
master-spirit of the place—the presiding judge.
   As there was some little difficulty in obtaining a
Grand Jury, the Court proceeded to the hearing of
motions. The first case brought up was, that of
   J<small>OHN</small> C. C<small>OLT</small>.—In this case, the counsel for the
defendant stated that they were not ready. John A.
Morrill, Esq., however, rose and read an affidavit,
of Charles H. <u title="Bibighans (elsewhere)">Brekenham</u>, physician, of Philadel-
phia; this affidavit stated that Mr. <u>Brekenham</u>, had
attended on Caroline Henshaw, (the woman who
lived with Colt) during her recent <i>accouchement</i>; that
she had been delivered of a boy on the 17th of De-
cember inst.; and could not possibly attend the trial
of Colt, as a witness, at present, without endanger-
ing her life. Mr. Morrill, therefore, wished the
trial to go off for the present term, as the witness
would be unable to attend at this inclement season.
   Mr. W<small>HITING</small> said, why I see no reason why the
trial should be put off for the term, even if the lady
has been confined. For the most delicate lady gets
over that in a month; and some German women get
over it in two or three days.
   Ultimately the trial of Colt was set down for that
day three weeks. The next case was that of
   S<small>ALLY</small> A<small>NN</small> R<small>OBB</small>.—This woman, it will be re-
membered, stands charged with killing her baby.

   A bill against the Corporation from A. H. Wheeler,
for the rent of the room in which Samuel Adams was
murdered, corner of Chambers street and Broadway, was
presented. The Mayor stated that the room had been
shut up for a long time, so that the Jury might see it—
but the trial not coming on, it was given up at the end
of eight weeks and two days, for which $25 has been
charged. There was also a charge of 50 cents for re-

before the body was found, in order to discover if there
was any blood under it. The bill was ordered to be
paid.

   A bill for $5 was presented from Mr. Relyea for at-

		<f20>ADDRESS</f20>
   TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES.
   F<small>ELLOW</small> C<small>ITIZENS</small>—The object of my addressing
you at this time, is not for the purpose of justifying
myself for the participation which I have had in the
frauds on the elective franchise, in the State of
New York, in the years 1838 and 1839, which
produced so much excitement after their disclosure,
and which were so widely, justly, and severely
commented upon in the public prints, not only in
this country, but in England. That I did partici-
pate in these transactions, I admit, and can only,
so far as I am concerned, frankly acknowledge my
error. The evil is done, and I sincerely regret that
I ever, in any way, allowed myself to participate
<i>with others</i> in a transaction for which I have been
compelled by circumstances to be the only sufferer.
In justice to my country—in justice to my family
—in justice to my friends—in justice to myself—I
am determined now, be the effect on myself what
it may, to present to the public a full, candid, true
and impartial account of those frauds, in which I
shall
<m9>	“Nothing extenuate,
	Nor set down aught in malice.”</m9>
   I am well aware that duty required me to adopt this
course long since, but, through force of circum-
stances, my hands have been tied and my lips closed;
and while my name has been branded from one ex-
tent of the country to the other, I have been com-
pelled to be silent, and tamely bear the whole odium
attached to those transactions. I was in the power
of men equally guilty with myself, and both threats
and promises were resorted to to obtain the “mer-
cy of my silence.” An indictment was pending
over me for participating in these frauds, and until
that was removed, my personal liberty required
me to keep secret that which justice demanded
should be known. That necessity is now removed.
I am released from that indictment, (it having been
discharged on the 22d ultimo,) and the truth shall
now be laid before the people, and the guilty, be
compelled to bear their just proportion of that,
which heretofore, I have singly and alone, been
forced to sustain.
   No one but myself knows what I have suffered.—
I have, since the first disclosures were made, seen
friend after friend desert me, and out of all that nu-
merous host with which I was on terms of intima-
cy, but few remain that call themselves my friends.
			... I expected them
to act honorably towards me; and it was not until
I discovered, upon several occasions, an evident de-
sign (notwithstanding repeated assurances to the
contrary) to sacrifice and destroy me, to load me
with ignominy, and “whistle me down the world,
a prey to fortune,” that I understood the true posi-
tion in which I was placed. They appeared to con-
sider it necessary to so far ruin my reputation that
aught I could say in relation to them would be of
no avail. They acted as if they considered their
safety dependant of their success in affixing infamy
and odium upon my character. How far they have
succeeded depends upon a verdict of the people.
	...
With politics I have done—I have no hopes or ex-
pectations from party. The disclosures I shall
make will be made free from any bias, and on ma-
ture deliberation, after having carefully collected
the facts and memoranda upon which to base it.—
	...
   Independent of any evidence, let us apply the or-
dinary rules of logic to the transactions in relation
to these frauds, and see whether they are for or
against the truth of my statement. If the statement
which I made to Mr. J. D. Stevenson in relation to
these frauds was not true, (and it has always been
denied by the leaders of the whig party,) why was
I removed from office? It was admitted that I had
faithfully and ably performed the duties of the sta-
tion I held, and if the charges against me were
false, then I was a persecuted man; and as they
admitted I was competent, and had rendered essen-
tial services to the party, was it not their duty to
sustain me? I had <i>their written acknowledgement
of my services</i>, not in measured terms, but in terms
of unqualified approbation. Let us look also at the
other side of the question. If the charges were
true, and known to Governor Seward and the pro-
minent leaders of the whig party, (which I solemn-
ly aver they did know,) were they not bound to sus-
tain me, instead of attempting to degrade me, and
leaving me to contend against the other party un-
aided (except secretly) and alone? It is well
known that the whig leaders would neither openly
carry me through my difficulties, nor permit the
whig party to rally around me. If I alone was
guilty—if they had no participation in the frauds—
if they were ignorant of the transactions—if I accu-
sed and charged upon the innocent a gross violation
of the laws of the land—then I deeply injured them.
I merited their severest censure. Why, they, did
they secretly aid and assist me, but publicly calum-
niate me? Such was the course they pursued, un-
til they supposed their public slanders had so
far blasted my reputation that their victim could
be sacrificed without danger to themselves.
   Unless I was guilty of the charges against me,
there was no reason why I should not have receiv-
ed the confidence and support of the whig party.
During a period of nine years, I labored like a slave,
as thousands can attest, in the organization of that
party; and after the result of the election in 1838,
I was solicited to accept office, and declined it. I
was satisfied with the business in which I was then
engaged; and subsequent events have convinced
me, that the most unfortunate era of my life was
that in which I accepted office. It was conceded
that I merited the office; it was conceded that the
duties were ably and faithfully discharged; yet I
was removed from it before the expiration of the
term for which I had been appointed. Was there
not some cause why I was removed? What was
that cause? If I was <i>guilty</i> of the frauds charged
upon me, was I alone <i>guilty</i>? were they known
only to me? If <i>innocent</i>, why remove me from
office, and thus add the persecution of my own par-
ty to that of my political opponents? These are
questions which I wish the public to solve. If
those charged as participators in the election
frauds were innocent, why did they not court in-
vestigation, nay, demand it? Their innocence, seal-
ed by a verdict of a jury of their country, would have
made for them party capital, because they would
have been looked upon as persecuted men. But
the guilty generally reason from false premises—
they shunned investigation—they created a disas-
trous issue for themselves. Instead of endeavor-
ing to screen me, their efforts were directed to re-
moving all suspicion from themselves. Had they
reasoned correctly, they would have seen, that had
I been convicted of the charge, the public would
have known that I could not, unaided, have perpe-
trated such stupendous frauds. Some saw the
question in its true light—some felt the danger of
their situations; and it was probably in <u title="consequence">consquence</u>
thereof, that I was indebted for the friendly visits
and letters of some of the members of the Grand
Jury, who were <u title="impanelled">impannelled</u> during the term that
the first attempt was made to indict me. Had
that responsible body been tampered with? and if
so, by whom, and for what purpose? Such high-
handed acts would not have been perpetrated with-
out strong motives. One thing is certain, I did
not tamper with the jury, neither was it done by
my request. Did those who have been accused
know of the frauds? If so—if I alone was guilty—
what motive could others have had to assist me, in
the least, during the judicial proceedings against
me? By my <u title="acts">actss</u> they had been accused—if in-
nocent, how deeply had I wronged them! Who
retained, and <i>so heavily</i> feed the counsel employed
to defend me, both on the examination and on my
trial? Charles O'Conner and David Graham, jr.,
Esqrs., were employed and paid by some one, not
by <i>myself</i>. James M. Smith, jr., Esquire, was the
only counsel employed by me. My trial came on
—the jury did not agree, and were discharged.—
Up to this time, my confederates—some of them,
at least—deemed it essential that I should not be
<d>[Col.8]</d>
convicted. Up to this time I had been silent as to
their participation with me in the frauds for which
I was justly suffering. The Grand Jury had failed
to indict them; <i>my personal safety was their guar-
antee for my silence</i>. The indictment was pend-
ing, and they knew that a word against <i>them</i> would
furnish evidence against <i>myself</i>. They also knew
that the <i>statute of limitations</i> would soon protect
them from any indictment for the part they acted
in the frauds for which I was indicted. That time
expired the beginning of November, 1841. Three
attempts were made by my counsel, James M.
Smith, Jr., Esq., for my discharge, urging at each
time, either a trial or a discharge from the indict-
ment; but it was deferred by the Court from term
to term, until the <i>statute of limitations would
protect the persons implicated, and then my dis-
charge was granted!!!</i>
   For some time after the trial, my confederates
ceased to hold any communication with me in re-
lation to the election frauds. But a circumstance
occurred which again brought them to ask of me a
favor, humbled as I was. Trampled upon as I had
been, I had still, as they knew, the power to harm.
I had certain papers in my possession which were
dangerous to them. I was in possession of some
facts, and they feared that information might pos-
sibly leak out that would defeat the confirmation of
certain nominations under the general government.
Again, therefore, negociations were set on foot,
and I confess openly to the public, that, convinced
as I had been, by their acts, of their utter turpi-
tude and treachery towards me, I professedly ac-
ceded to their offers, and availed myself, by strata-
gem, of additional evidence to fortify myself against
my powerful adversaries. Their foot was on my
neck—thousands to one against me; and while
thus prostrate, strategy was my only hope of deliv-
erance. How well my plan succeeded, the public
hereafter shall know. In the expose which I feel
it my duty to make, many will be mentioned whose
feelings I would not willingly wound; but it is not
my fault if others, less immediately connected and
inculpated in these transactions, are pointed out.
The act was their own; and as my statement must
be a faithful one, I cannot pass them by. The
whole transactions shall now be given to the pub-
lic, with such evidence as I have to substantiate
the charges. All I ask is a candid perusal; and I
appeal to all who shall read these written, and
now complete documents and narratives, to mark
the connected, unbroken and lucid chain of evi-
dence they present, of locality, names, dates, per-
sons, incidents, conversations, &c. &c. to say,
whether they believe it to be within the compass
of possibility, that any human being, however gift-
ed in intellect, base in moral depravity, or mad-
dened by despair, could, with the most fertile and
ingenious inventive powers, have fabricated such a
story, or forged such papers as are presented.
   Almost all the original letters and memoranda
have come into my possession within a few days;
and those who deserve the censure cannot now, by
any subterfuge, escape the just and merited re-
proach which a people, jealous of their rights,
will visit upon those who attempt, by fraud, to
wrest them from them.
   It will be seen, in the sequel, that the reproach
and the ignominy which they strove to fix on me
alone, should be shared by others who hold higher
stations, and have more friends, more wealth, and
more influence to sustain them, than myself; and
though I am aware that their participation will
not screen me from the reproach I merit for the
part I have performed, it will, at least, teach them
that neither wealth, place, influence, or perjury,
are safe guarantees against the exposure of guilt.
   To the public I appeal, confessing and <u title="regretting">regreting</u>
my errors, and by their verdict I must abide, be it
for or against me.
		Very respectfully,
				JAMES B. GLENTWORTH.

<b>Trial of John C. Colt, for the <u>alledged</u> Mur-
	der of Mr. Adams, the Printer.</b>
   It being known about town that the trial of John
C. Colt, the teacher of book-keeping, was to be
called on yesterday morning, at half past 10 o'clock,
in the Court of Oyer and Terminer, before Judge
Kent, long before that hour every avenue to the
Court room was crowded with persons of all classes
and ages, eager to obtain admittance.
   Colt was taken into the room privately at quite an
early hour, in the custody of A. M. C. Smith, and
placed in the corner of the room, on the left hand
side of the Judge's seat. The doors were then
opened, and the large space allotted for the specta-
tors was filled in three or four minutes, so great was
the anxiety to see and hear this most extraordinary
trial. The officers in attendance preserved most ad-
mirable order; they kept the place within the bar
entirely clear from <u title="every">ever</u> one, except the reporters of
the daily papers, the witnesses, and members of the
bar. The doors were then closed, and hundreds
waited and clamored outside, unable to obtain ad-
mittance. Whilst in the Park, there were also hun-
dreds waiting to catch a sight of Colt or Mrs. Adams,
or any of the witnesses. In fact there has not been
such an universal and terrible excitement in this city
since the trial of Robinson.
   Colt himself looked more collected, calm, and in
better health than we have seen him enjoy since his
arrest. He sat with his back to the audience, con-
versing freely with his brother, and at intervals
reading the “Herald.” Officer Smith, at one time
approached him, and said, “Have you seen the
Sun, Mr. Colt?” He replied very calmly and cheer-
fully, “No, I have not, but I should like to.” Upon
which, Smith handed him that paper. His brother
seemed a good deal affected, but the only evidence
of mental agony about Colt, was seen in a restless
<u title="rolling">ralling</u> of the eye, and a convulsive twitching of the
mouth.
   Precisely at half-past ten o'clock, Judge Kent en-
tered the room and took his seat. The Circuit Court
was then opened. Before this, Dudley Selden, Mr.
<u title="Emmet (elsewhere)">Emmett</u>, and John A. Morrill, were in attendance
as Colt's Counsel; and Mr. James Smith as asso-
ciate of the District Attorney, Mr. Whiting.
<l9>   J<small>UDGE</small> K<small>ENT</small>—Mr. Whiting, the Aldermen will be
detained till eleven o'clock, when they will be here.
—An interpreter has applied for pay in the arson
case.
   W<small>HITING</small>—Very well, sir.
   About eleven o'clock, <u title="Aldermen">Alderman</u> Purdy and Lee
entered and took their seats, and the Court of Oyer
and Terminer was opened.
   Mr. W<small>HITING</small> then rose and said, “I now call on
the case of John C. Colt<u title=".”">.</u>
   J<small>UDGE</small> K<small>ENT</small>—Put the prisoner at the bar.
   C<small>OLT</small> then rose and walked to the end of the long
table where his counsel sat, with a firm steady step,
an unblanched cheek, and an eye that did not
quail; he then sat down by the side of Mr. <u>Em-
mett</u>.
   Mrs. A<small>DAMS</small> was present, dressed in deep mourn-
ing, but looked uncommonly well in health and ap-
pearance.
   The female who lived with Colt, and who has
recently been confined in Philadelphia, was also
present, with two other females.
   The C<small>LERK</small>, H<small>ENRY</small> V<small>ANDERVOORT</small>, then rose and
said—“The gentlemen who are summoned as petit
jurors, will please to answer to their names as they
are called.”
	Wm. E. Bailey		Ebenezer Howe,
	Francis Clark,		George Hurry,
	George Dixon,		John Huestis,
	<u title="Hampton (elsewhere, Longworth's 1839)">Hampden</u> D. Gage,		Cornelius E. Jacobus,
	Hiram Harrison,		Morris Ketchum,
	Samuel Frost,		Charles Pearsall,
	Thomas King,		James W. Quackenboss,
	Vincent LeCompte,	Andrew Quackenboss,
	Wm. Leggett,		John Quackenboss,
	Wm. Key,				John Harris,

	George Spicer,		Joshua Brush,

	Francis Olderhousen,	Samuel W. Henman,
	Thomas Hollahan,		Nicholas ——.
   Of all this number, only nineteen answered to their
names.
   C<small>LERK</small>—Only nineteen jurors anwwer, sir.
   J<small>UDGE</small> K<small>ENT</small>.—Nineteen jurors only answer to
their names, Mr. Attorney.
   S<small>ELDEN</small>—Do you demand a tales?
   W<small>HITING</small>—Yes, sir.
   J<small>UDGE</small> K<small>ENT</small>—The statute says, that when 24
jurors do not answer to their names, the Court shall
direct the Sheriff to summon a sufficient number
from the city and county; and, considering the cir-
cumstances of this case, which render it likely that
it will be difficult to form a jury, the Court therefore
will order the Sheriff.
   S<small>ELDEN</small>—Before the Court makes the order, I
have a question to propose as to the organization of
the Court, which, without attempting to throw any
unnecessary objections in the way, I deem it the
duty of counsel to propose. I would therefore ask,
if the record exhibits the fact as to who constitute
the Court.
   J<small>UDGE</small> K<small>ENT</small>—Certainly, the Circuit Judge, and
two Aldermen only. What motion do you intend
to found on that, sir?
   S<small>ELDEN</small>—No motion, your Honor. But does the
record exhibit that fact?
   J<small>UDGE</small> K<small>ENT</small>—Most unquestionably it does; and
the Court, in considering the circumstances of this
case, and the difficulty in getting a jury, do order
the Sheriff to summon 300 persons from the county
at large to be in attendance here at 10 o'clock on
Wednesday morning.
   S<small>ELDEN</small>—Will that be time enough?
   J<small>UDGE</small> K<small>ENT</small>—In the case of Ezra White, the
Sheriff was directed to summon 200 witnesses the
next day, but there was some difficulty in getting
them together. It is thought that Wednesday will
allow sufficient time.
   S<small>ELDEN</small>—I have no desire to create any delay.
   J<small>UDGE</small> K<small>ENT</small>—The Court also order the Sheriff to
have ten additional constables to keep order.
   The Court then adjourned.</l9>

   <f15>TRIAL OF JOHN C. COLT.</f15>
			——
	Court of Oyer and Terminer.
		J<small>UDGE</small> K<small>ENT</small> presiding.
				W<small>EDNESDAY</small>, J<small>AN</small>. 19.
   The same intense excitement prevailed through-
out the community that was seen on Monday
last. By eight o'clock in the morning, all the
avenues to the City Hall were blocked up with
a dense crowd, eager to obtain admittance to the
	...
   Mr. S<small>ELDEN</small> then made a very able argument
to show that the meaning of the statute was,
that the Counsel for prisoner ought to have more
time than had been allowed where they had to ex-
amine a panel of 300 persons; and he moved that
the trial be postponed till Friday morning to allow
time to examine the panel; which was put into
his hand only this morning.
   Mr. W<small>HITING</small> made an able, but brief reply.
   The C<small>OURT</small> ruled that the trial must proceed; in
the case of Ezra White only 5 jurors were got out
of <u title="panel">pannel</u> of 200. And if they adopted Mr. Selden's
course the trial would be interminable protracted.
The Court would afford all the patience, protec-
tion, impartiality and justice that could possibly
be given to the cause, mixed with kindness for the
prisoner.
   The prisoner's counsel then put in an affidavit
relative to the time they obtained the panel, and
also that the jurors were selected from the Grand
Jury list.
   W<small>HITING</small>.—The affidavit is put in after the bal-
lots had been put in the box.
   Mr. S<small>ELDEN</small> excepted to the ruling of the Court.
   The cause then proceeded. The Court decided
that questions might be asked of the witness be-
fore he was challenged.
   The following were then called as jurors.
   J<small>AMES</small> B. A<small>YRES</small>, 198 Fulton street. He had
formed no opinion, and was sworn.
	...
   J<small>OSEPH</small> B<small>ISHOP</small>, grocer, 552 Grand street—Had
read all the statements in the papers, but they
made no impression on him. Sworn.
	...
   N<small>ATHAN</small> R. <u title="Husted (elsewhere)">H<small>UESTED</small></u>, keeper of North Ameri-
can Hotel, Bowery—sworn.
	...
   E<small>PENETUS</small> H<small>OWE</small>, 53 Libery street—Had tried
to form an opinion in order not to serve on the jury,
but he could not. Sworn.
   J<small>AMES</small> S<small>UYDAM</small>, corner of Grand and Forsyth
street, has such a natural antipathy to robbery and
murder, that he is not free from bias. Stood
aside.
   Here the Court took a recess till four o'clock.
		A<small>FTERNOON</small> S<small>ESSION</small>.
   S. J. B<small>ARRY</small>, not present.
	...
   Mr. H<small>OBBY</small>, 274 Grand street—Had no opinion,
and was sworn.
	...
   H<small>IRAM</small> M. F<small>ORRESTER</small>, dry goods merchant, 242
Broadway—Have not formed a positive opinion; I
should be unwilling to convict him on the testimony
I have heard; subscribe to the “Journal of Com-
merce,” and occasionally to the small papers.
Sworn.
   Here Mr. A<small>YRES</small>, the foreman of the jury, asked
leave to be discharged; his wife was dangerously
ill. He was sworn to this. The counsel on both
sides said they would raise no objection to these
proceedings, as far as they have gone, if this juror
was discharged. The Court discharged him.

	...
   H<small>OSEA</small> <u title="F. (elsewhere, Longworth's 1839)">M.</u> C<small>LARK</small>, 167 Greenwich street, dry
goods dealer, had read all, but formed no opinion.
Sworn.
	...
   E<small>LIAS</small> H<small>ATFIELD</small>, 472 Broadway, formed no
opinion, knows none of the parties, has no con-
scientious scruples. Sworn.
	...
   C<small>HARLES</small> H. D<small>ELAVAN</small>, has read the papers;
knows none of the parties; except Colt's brother;
what he read did not influenced his mind; has no
conscientious scruples about serving. Sworn.
	...
   Mr. D<small>ODSWORTH</small> read two stories; they clashed
so with each other that I could not make up my
mind. I've seen so many instances where the ac-
cused has proved innocent, that I'm slow in mak-
ing up my mind. Sworn.

   A. H. <u title="Duncombe Alfred H. (Longworth's 1839)">D<small>UNSCOMBE</small></u>, 337 Pearl street, brush maker;
has no bias one way or another. Sworn.
	...
   G<small>EORGE</small> T. T<small>RIMBALL</small>, and S<small>AMUEL</small> F. M<small>OTT</small>,
were then sworn.
   J<small>OHN</small> H. <u title="WILLIAMS">W<small>ILLIMS</small></u>, 315 Pearl and 199 Madison
streets, was satisfied there had been a killing, had
an impression that it was done by Colt, but wheth-
er it was a justifiable homicide or not, I have no im-
pression. He was sworn.
	...
   H<small>AMPTON</small> D. G<small>AGE</small>; formed an opinion. Set
aside.
   J<small>ACOB</small> A. W<small>ESTERVELT</small> and W<small>M.</small> B. C<small>ROSBY</small>.
   Here the <u title="panel">pannel</u> was exhausted. The Court
then <u title="directed">driected</u> the Sheriff to summon one person to-
morrow morning at 10 o'clock, duly qualified to
serve.
   The usual directions were then given by the
Court to the jury, and the Court adjourned till 11
o'clock this (Thursday) morning.

		<b>Trial of John C. Colt.</b>
   We give to-day the first day's proceedings in the
trial of John C. Colt. The most intense interest is
felt. The whole of yesterday was spent in procur-
ing a jury. To-day the opening speech will be giv-
en—and the evidence begin. <i>This afternoon, at four
o'clock</i>, an EXTRA HERALD will be published,
containing the proceedings up to that date.
   P. S.—Since writing the above, we find that the
Court adjourned at eleven o'clock last night to
eleven o'clock this morning. The entire panel of
there hundred talesmen was exhausted, and also
the original panel of thirty-six. Out of these three
hundred and thirty-six, eleven jurors were sworn to
try the cause. The twelfth will be sworn this
morning.
   The following are the names of the eleven:—
	Charles H. <u title="Delavan (elsewhere)">Delevan</u>,		Hiram Forrester,
	Joseph Bishop,			Hosea F. Clark,
	Nathan R. <u>Husted</u>,	Elias Hatfield,
	Epenetus Howe,		<u title="Thomas Doddsworth (elsewhere)">Francis Dodsworth</u>,
	Jas. R. Hobby,		Alfred H. <u title="Duncombe (elsewhere)">Dunscomb</u>,
		John H. Williams.
   The prisoner's counsel exhausted sixteen peremp-
tory challenges out of his twenty, having only four
left, and challenged two for the favor.

Wheeler's (Colt had) if Colt left, and had slept in
Wheeler's room when I was left by the Staten Is-
land boat; on that Friday, September 17, I went to
Wheeler's about four o'clock; when he then told
me what he had heard, and though I laughed at
the idea, and wouldn't believe it; till I saw him go
and look through the key-hole of Colt's door; I
then got on the desk and listened at the folding
doors, the key-hole of that door being stopped; I
listened and heard <i>no noise whatever</i>; every thing
was perfectly silent; don't know what transpired
till Mr. Wheeler asked me if I would go for an of-
ficer; I proceeded to the Halls of Justice in Centre
street, and asked for Mr. <u title="Bowyer (Robert W. Bowyer)">Boyer</u>; was told he'd be
in in a few minutes; I waited a few moments, hav-
ing a young man in his charge, <u title="and">an</u> I nodded to
him and told him I wished to see him; he re-
turned in a few minutes, and I told him what had
occurred at the Granite Building; he said he'd
go in a few minutes. He stepped to a room and
asked if any one there would go to the Granite
Buildings; he said he would go. I returned to
Wheeler's office, told him one would be there in
half in hour; I staid a little while, then went to
tea; this was a little after six; we had tea then at
half-past six; I then went back to Wheeler's office;

   The excitement in this extraordinary case in-
creases with every succeeding day. The crowds
	...
   Colt's father was not present ; nor was Caroline
Henshaw. The jury passed the night at the Knick-
erbocker Hotel, Park Row; all newspapers were
<u title="carefully">carfully</u> kept from them.
   The Court came in at 10, precisely.
   Mr. W<small>HITING</small> called Mr. <u title="Hockton (elsewhere)">Octon</u> to the stand.
   Mr. <u title="SELDEN (elsewhere)">S<small>ELDON</small></u> and Mr. <u>E<small>MMETT</small></u> made affidavit
complaining of <i>two wood-cuts</i> in the “Tattler” and
the “Extra Herald.” Mr. Selden made a speech
requesting the court to issue warrants for the ar-
rest of the publishers of the Tattler and the He-
rald.
   The Court declined interfering in the matter, un-
less a plain and palpable case of contempt was
brought before them.
   Mr. W<small>HITING</small> called the fourth witness.
   <u title="LOWE HOCKTON (elsewhere)">L<small>OW</small> O<small>CTON</small></u> (colored man) <i>examined</i>—Is 57
years old; resides in the granite buildings; been
there 26½ months; was first one that lived in the
building; I am on the third story, Nos. 14 & 15.
At the first, I lived in the upper part of all; last
September I was in the third story; my duty is
to open and close the building; I am sexton of
a small Baptist Church; I know John C. Colt, pri-
soner at the bar; his room was No. 9 on second
floor; it adjoined Mr. Wheeler's; Wheeler's was
No. 10; I did not see what furniture Colt brought
in; I had nothing to do with his room; I never
was in Mr. Colt's room; he generally did his own
business, on the day Colt was took out of the room
by four gentlemen, I was in there; that was the
only time, I was called to that room by request of
an officer; I was called to go down to that room by
Mr. Wheeler, on the 17th of Sept., about 4 P.M.;
he said something had transpired in the next room
to him that had frightened him; I came down with
him; I went slowly or softly with Mr. Wheeler,
as he told me that he had——
   [Stopped.]
   W<small>ITNESS</small>—I walked softly to the door; Mr.
	...
end of that day with me. On next day, the 18th,
as I swept down the stairs, as I turned the last
flight of stairs but one, as I turned the bannister, I
saw a box standing in the hall at the head of the last
flight of stairs leading to the street; it was on the
second floor, about a foot from the stairs; on the
left side of the stairs coming down, by the bannis-
ters; it was a pine box; stood up on the end,
when I saw the box; I felt sorry that I had seen
the box; for it struck my mind——
			[Stopped.]
   W<small>ITNESS</small>—The box stood alone, when I first saw
it; at the end of a minute or two, I saw Mr. Colt
come to the box, from his room, or the direction
of his room; Mr. Colt had no coat on or jacket;
he had his waistcoat and shirt sleeves open; Mr.
Colt took hold of the box; he put it sideways and
slid it down toward the stairs; he went before
the stairs after he had started it, so as to keep
it from coming too fast; the box hitched once, did
not slip easy; Mr. Colt put his feet firm against
the stairs, and his shoulder against the box to start;
every now and then he put his left shoulder by
main force to start the box. <i>I wanted to get away
from that box</i>. (Here Colt smiled.) I was never
called into court; I had to stop sweeping to give
Mr. Colt a chance To get down with his box; when
he got down nine out of eighteen steps, I went up
stairs; no cause to do so, but to give him chance to
get his box down; I came down in six or seven
minutes, and the box was at the bottom of the stairs,
just round the bannisters. (Where <u title="Delnoce (elsewhere)">Delnose</u> de-
scribed it to have been.) I saw Mr. Colt stand
then out on the stoop in his shirt sleeves; he ap-
peared to be as if he was looking out for a carman;
I swept down, and came away and went up stairs
to dust the banisters; there was a mark on the box;
I thought not very skilful; made as it was marked
with a course pen, and the liquid was not black;
looked like blueish ink; I saw on it “New Or-
leans;” I did not see the rest; was not desirous to
do so; the box was three feet long; two and a half
feed wide, and about two feet deep; when I first
saw the box it was about quarter to eight; the time
from when I first saw it till I saw it at the foot of
the stairs, and he on the stoop, was about twenty
minutes; after that I saw no more of the box; I no-
ticed that about a quarter to nine, it had been re-
moved; during the time he was taking the box
down, he did not speak to me, nor I to him, not a
word; I had not seen that box before nor since; I
did not see the box in which the body was found.
   <i>Cross-examined</i> by S<small>ELDEN</small>—My family lived in
the third story, the whole of September. The
front door is sometimes opened by me—seldom.
	...
I am paid for looking after the building by the
owners; I am paid for looking after the rooms by
the tenants themselves; what I do for their rooms;
I had nothing to do with any room that month; on
the 4th story—none lodged on the 4th story as I
know—there were 28 and 29, Mr. Ridner, Apollo
Rooms, large exhibitions of pictures. They were
very large rooms, designed to exhibit pictures;
one particularly; the other for those concerned in
the exhibition; the other particularly for the ex-
hibition.
   No. 26, Mr. Stanton—He was a portrait drawer.
	...
   The 5th story was <i>Deggretype</i>—Mr. Vanlower—
to take profile—nothing else.
   On the 3d story, Mr. Charles Adams himself oc-
cupied two rooms—the proprietor, Nos. 21 and 22.
	...
   The second story has 7 and 8. I am not certain
if it was occupied then; it is not now; they are in
the right hand of the passage way, and the right
hand of the stairs, on the second story; they are on
the same side as Mr. Wheeler's room, and be-
tween it and the stairs.
   No. 9 was occupied by Mr. Colt.
   No. 10 was occupied by Mr. Wheeler.
   On the other side was a large room which used to
be occupied by Mr. Brackett, sculptor—a large
room. No. 11, in September it was occupied by
the self same gentleman that has it now, Mr. Os-
good, a portrait drawer.

   By S<small>ELDEN</small>—There were two doors between the
stairway and the door of Mr. Colt, on the lower
side; on the other side of that hall, there are but
two doors from the stairs to Broadway. There
used to be but one large room occupied by Dr. Ar-
noux—he had it divided. Mr. Osgood's door is
opposite Wheeler's. The other door is most op-
posite No. 7; the next door to the stairs. The
Apollo Room is general exhibition room to receive
visiters who pay to see pictures. It was so in
September. But they have removed their pic-
tures. It was generally lighted up at night except
on unpleasant weather—when no likely visiters—
no encouragement. But other times open 10 o'clock
in the morning to 10 o'clock at night. I raise up
the windows in the hall and passage when I sweep
in the morning, and leave them up in warm weather
till 11 at night, when I put the latch down. When
there is no fire called for, gentlemen generally
take charge of their own room. When the
windows of the hall are open there is con-
siderable draught. I had charge of no rooms
in September. Mr. Slocum's druggist's store; there
is a large door open into Broadway—another large
door open into Chamber street, and a door at back
of the store open into the main house—into the
passage way; this last is all thick boarded door—
no glass in it. Mr. Slocum's establishment is a
great resort in summer season. It was warm wea-
ther. I frequently see great many people go in
there. That more or less till cold weather stop it.
It closes week day at 11 o'clock, and Sunday eve-
ning it closes at 10 o'clock. In the warm weather
the druggist's large doors are generally left open.
About September Slocum's boys did not open that
store so early as present person occupy it now.—
They used to open it about 7 o'clock in summer—
between 7 and 8. Could not tell when Slocum left—
it was business a little out of my reach. He staid
till October. I never spoke to Mr. Colt on morn-
ing of 18th Sept. He never spoke to me but one
word all time he there, and that was to ask
me for key of privy. I told him Mr. Wheeler
had key answer for him both. That was all the
one word I ever spoke to him. I was always in the
habit to keep my bound, and only speak as I spoke
to him. It was a minute or two from the time I
saw the box till Mr. Colt came up to it. I first saw
the box as I turned the bottom of the flight of stairs
from the third story. The stairway is not spiral
like a corkscrew.
   Mr. S<small>ELDEN</small> asked witness if the stairway from
second to third story did not go in a reverse direc-
tion from the first flight of stairs form the street to
the first landing?
   The witness was a good deal puzzled, and could
not explain himself for some time, except by say-
ing this:
   W<small>ITNESS</small>—There is a bannister on the right all
the way; and as you go up the second flight of
stairs, you go higher and higher every step—
(laughter.)
   There was a great deal of foolish and unneces-
sary delay occasioned here by the counsel not in-
forming themselves of the state of the stairway
before they came into court. And the tiresome
repetitions of the same questions about the re-
lative situation of the second and third flight of
stairs, were very silly.
	...
to the 1st story; it was four o'clock in the after-
noon of 17th of September that <u title="Wheeler">wheeler</u> came to my
room; he staid two or three minutes talking; he
and I staid 6 or 8 minutes at Colt's door; I made
no attempt to look through he key hole of Colt's
	...
and also a cistern in the yard; that's how we
supply ourselves with water; the privies in the
back yard are detached from the main building.
	...
There were but six separate privies in that back
yard. They were distributed among the differ-
ent tenants of that building; keys were gene-
rally given to each gentleman that hired the
rooms; and several gentlemen had to go to
one place, because, the six privies could not
afford to accommodate one each for so many;
one of the officers has recently called for the key
and examined that privy; that is the officer there;
(pointing to Relyea); the key I gave to the officer
was the one that opened the privy belonging to, or
used by Wheeler; some keys opened several
doors; there were two or three men with the offi-
cer; it was ten or eleven o'clock at night; it was
a month or six weeks ago. Mr. Adams gave me
permission to give the officer the key; I saw no-
thing they did; the same officer returned me the
key; there has been no farther inspections of that
privy.
	...
   R<small>ICHARD</small> B<small>ARSTOW</small> ex'd.—Is 34 years old. Am a
carman, live at 272 Nineteenth street. I know
John C. Colt, the prisoner at the bar. I first saw
Colt at abot 90 or 100 on Chambers street, the right
hand side of the way. I came down Hudson street,
to Chambers street—left home quarter to nine.
About Church street, in Chambers street, I saw a
man standing on the South side-walk by the curb-
stone, as if looking for some body. He asked me
if I was engaged and I said not particularly. He
stepped into the street to me. I asked him what
he wanted—he said to take a box to Maiden lane.
I said as my business lay that way, I'd take it. I
told him I would take it. I drove up the street;
he followed; and crossed over to the north side.
I drove passed the door of the granite build-
ings; he went past it and then beckoned
me into the door of the granite buildings, as if to
say the box was there. There was a spring cart
stood sideways in front of the door; I backed in,
in front diagonally, as near as I could get to the
door—<i>that's the gentleman sitting there that beckoned</i></l9>
<d>[Col.3]</d>
<l9><i>to me then</i>, (<small>POINTING TO</small> C<small>OLT</small>.) He went into the
building; he had got up three or four steps of the
first stairway as I went into the door; he then point-
ed to the box. [Diagram shown to witness, and
he described it as standing where Delnoce said it
stood.] Mr. Colt did not say a word; the other
carman who had the spring cart, took hold of one
end of the box, and helped me put it on the cart.
Colt stood still on the stairs whilst I was doing
this; I went back to ask what vessel it was to go on
board of; he said he didn't know the name of the
vessel; he said the vessel was at the foot of Maiden
Lane; I then took a look at the man so as I'd know
him again; I drove into Broadway, down Broad-
way to Maiden lane, down Maiden lane to the foot
of it; I looked back several times, to see if the
man followed me, and he did; when I got at
the foot of Maiden lane, I saw the box
was marked “New Orleans.” I saw it was mark-
ed before, and I thought it was to go on board a
packet or vessel going there. I saw a sign up for
New Orleans at foot of Maiden lane, and I stopped
and saw him (Colt) close by and pointed to the
sign to see if that was the vessel and he nodded;
he was on the right side of Maiden lane going down.
This was the pier on the right hand side of Maiden
lane; the vessel was the Kalamazoo. I backed
up to the side of the pier, and shot the box off as
I would a box of sugar. He came up and paid me
2s 6d in change; he had said nothing to me at the
time of asking me to take the box about the price,
or I should have charged him 3 shillings; but I
thought I should have more trouble to get the other
sixpence out of him than it was worth. He said
not a word to me at the time he paid me, and I
went away about my business.
   (Here the Aldermen left the bench for a short
time.)
   Mr. B<small>ARSTOW</small> <i>continued</i>—The mark on the box
was on the upper side, as I placed it on the cart; so
it was on the dock; I drove up Peck Slip as I left;
I made no entry in any book, of the load; I never
do; I next saw the prisoner before the coroner's
jury, when he was fetched.
   <i>Cross-examined by</i> S<small>ELDEN</small>—I saw Colt two-thirds
of the way down Chambers street, between Church
street and Broadway; it was from nine to half-past
nine; he beckoned to me; not later than half-past
nine; between the time I removed the box from
the building, to getting to the vessel, was as ordi-
nary fast; the person who asked me to take the
box, followed me down to the pier; when there, I
turned round, and found him close by; he paid me,
and I left; said nothing; 2s 6d is the price for a
common load; that was an uncommon load; I had
never seen the prisoner before that time; and never
afterwards till I saw him before the coroner's in-
quest.
   By W<small>HITING</small>.—I next saw the box in the ship the
following Sunday week; I helped to get the box out
of the hold of the vessel; I worked hard to do it;
I knew it as soon as I saw it in the hold, before it
was taken out; it was opened between decks; it
contained a dead body, a human body; the box was
then closed and put on a cart, and taken I presume
to the dead house; I didn't see it at the dead house;
	...
   By W<small>HITING</small>—When I left the box there; the
chief mate of the vessel stood on the deck by the
cargo; I think I saw Colt advance towards him,
and I think the mate said something about a receipt.
The mate wast the same that afterwards over-
hauled the cargo and helped get the box out.
   T<small>HOMAS</small> R<small>USSELL</small>—is 29 years old; a carman;
live at 213, Seventeenth street. On 18th Septem-
ber I called at usual place of employment from
three to half-past nine, at Granite Buildings; my
employer was John P. Ridner. I waited at the
door; drove my horse lengthways off the
curb stone; very shortly a gentleman came in
and a cart drove up; and as I saw a box stand-
ing in the entry of the buildings, I thought it
easiest to help to put the box on the cart, than
to untie my horse; that's the gentleman there
(pointing to Colt); whilst we were loading the
box, that gentleman stood on the lower flight of
stairs, apparently unconcerned about the box; he
said nothing all the time; the box stood on the
end, mark towards the druggist's door; there
was a large G on it; we put it on the cart,
the marked side previous. On Saturday the
26th I went to the Mayor's office; he told me the
circumstances; I gave him a description of the
box as near as I could, and I went in search of the
horse and cart. <u>I did'nt</u> know the carman, but
<i>knew his horse</i>; I found him that night. We all
went to the Mayor, and then were told to go to the
ship Kalamazoo; we went; saw the mate; staid
till 9 at night; went to the Mayor's office; told to
go to the ship next morning at 9. The agent of the
ship looked a his bills of lading, and found a re-
ceipt was given for every thing but that box, but
the dimensions of the box he had. We then
searched the forward hold, and the other carman
pointed out the box from its size, before we
could get hold of it. We got out of the hold;
saw the box brought <u title="up to">upto</u> the between decks,
and opened; I saw some cloths; awning I suppose
it was. The stench was so great I could not stay,
and went on the upper deck. I saw it no more till
the box was hoisted to the upper deck. I did not
see it put on the cart, nor on the dock; I kept back
on account of the stench; I did not see if there
was a body in the box.
	...
   By S<small>ELDEN</small>.—My cart had been there about five
minutes that morning before Colt and the cart came
up to the door.
   W<small>M.</small> F. G<small>ODFREY</small>.—Is <u title="superintendent">superindent</u> of carts.—
On Friday, Sept. 24th, I was at the Mayor's office.
The Mayor told me there was a box missing from
the corner of Broadway and Chambers street; he
thought some carman had taken it away. He asked

It was Sunday Sept. 26th. The box was marked
“R. <u title="P. (in file 0153, elsewhere)">C.</u> Gross, St. Louis, care of De Gray & Co.,
New Orleans.”
   <i>Cross-examined</i>.—Don't recollect making a bet as
to the result of this prosecution; I said if I wasn't
a witness I might; don't recollect for what; we
were all talking about this affair; there was a hat
talked about; I was talking with Mr. Fallon; I
didn't offer to bet; I said “if I wasn't a witness,”
after this was all over; I made no offer of betting
with any one about this transaction; Mr. Fallon
proposed betting me a hat that the man would go
clear; I didn't take up the offer; I first saw first</l9>
<d>[Col.4]</d>

	...
   By W<small>HITING</small>—Fallon, keeper of the City Prison,
offered to bet with me. He knew I had been en-
gaged in getting the body. <i>I've had oceans of appli-
cations—a thousand after me to bet money, hats and
every thing about this; whether they were sent to me or
not, I can't tell</i>.
   By S<small>ELDEN</small>—I did not know Colt was arrested
till that Saturday before we found the body. On
the Friday before the Mayor did not mention Mr.
Colt's name to me.
   The witness subsequently named Mr. Kipland,
and a man in Bank street, who had offered to bet
with him.
   [The Court adjourned at 3 to 4 o'clock.]
		Afternoon Session.
   J<small>OHN</small> S. E<small>LWELL</small>.—Resides in Brooklyn; is
agent for ship Kalamazoo; she belongs to A. & B.
Kingsland, and Capt. Skerrin. She sailed for New
Orleans about the 1st of October; we advertised
her to sail under a freight; she sailed as a transient
ship; it was expected she'd sail about the 20th of
September; she commenced taking in cargo in
August. She laid at the end of the pier at first
time of taking in cargo, then drew up to the end of
the dock. Wm. L. Coffin was chief mate; he went
to New Orleans to join his ship and went with her
to Europe. On Saturday morning, Sept. 18th, I
went on the dock to see after the cargo; at first the
box before mentioned was not there; I was on
board, and saw the mate writing a receipt, and told
him it was not correct; he merely put the names
and not the residences on the receipt, so I filled up
the balance of the receipt myself,—“Gross, St.
Louis; care of De Gray & Co., New Orleans.”
	...
   By a J<small>UROR</small>.—The receipt, I don't know wheth-
er it had the name of the person from whom the
box was received. I know of no such house as De
Gray in New Orleans, nor no such house as R. P.
Gross in St. Louis.
   Here the testimony of the mate in writing was
read as follows:—

was taken from said ship, and while it was between
decks, deponent threw a quantity of chloride of lime on
said box.

   Sworn to this 11th day of October, 1841, before me,
				R<small>OBERT</small> T<small>AYLOR</small>,
	Special Justice in and for the city of New York.
   The above deposition having been taken under an or-
der of this court, that the same be so taken as a condi-
tion to the postponement of the cause, all objections to
its being read on the trial, on the ground of its having
been sworn to before Justice Taylor, is waived, but the
same is taken, subject to all other legal objections, I ha-
ving attended the examination on behalf of the prisoner,
and waived the necessity of taking the same in his per-
sonal presence.					R. EMMET,

   Mr. <u title="DELNOCE (elsewhere)">DELNOSE</u> recalled.—The night I went to
sleep in Wheeler's room I had a lamp burning. It
	...
   A<small>BNER</small> <u title="MILLIKEN (elsewhere)">M<small>ILLIKIN</small></u>—Is deputy Coroner. On Sun-
day, 26th September, I was informed this box had
been found on board ship Kalamazoo, at the foot of
Maiden lane; I went down on board the ship and
found the Mayor, magistrates, and several officers,
hoisting out goods from lower to second deck. Af-
ter an hour or an hour and a half, the box was hoist-
ed out on to the second deck; this box was mark-
ed—
	R. P. Gross, New Orleans,
		Care of
			De Gray & Co.
				St. Louis.
The carpenter of the ship opened the box. When
we lifted the lid the stench was so great that all
went on deck except the coroner, myself, Mr. God-
frey and the carpenter of the ship. On taking off
the cloths off the body, <i>I discovered a white sub-
stance, which I took to be common table salt; fine salt;
there were two quarts of it;</i> there were worms in
amongst it and very offensive. The coroner then
sent for chloride of lime, which was thrown into
the box; it was closed up, hoisted out, put on a
cart, taken to the dead house, and I locked the
door and kept the key. I was present when the
box was opened and helped take the body out; I
found a dress coat in the box much cut to pieces,
	...</l9>
<d>[Col.6]</d>
<l9>	...
   Here the District Attorney directed Mr. Milli-
ken to bring the box and coat and stock and all to
the Court room to-night.
   Mr. M<small>ILLIKEN</small> said he could not get them to-
night.
   J<small>UDGE</small> K<small>ENT</small> said that as the box, &c., was very
offensive he wished them to be examined the last
thing to-night; that we might adjourn immediate-
ly after, and have the room ventilated.
   Mr. W<small>HITING</small> said, that if the whole box was
brought in, it would make every body sick.
   The Court directed Mr. Milliken to bring the
lid of the box to court about nine o'clock.

   R<small>OBERT</small> H. M<small>ORRIS</small> <i>examined</i>.—Is Mayor of the
city. On Thursday, (the 23d of Sept.) I was first
spoken to in relation to this matter; on that evening
after a statement had been made to me about some-
thing wrong at the Granite Buildings, I went over
there, saw and spoke to several; saw a colored man
and wife, and spoke to them; next day I associated
Judge Taylor with me to make the investigation;
he took down testimony of two gentlemen I had
seen night before and others; and sworn them to it;
and on those affidavits I issued the warrant to <u title="arrest Mr. Colt (in file 0153)">arrest
of Mr. Colt</u>; I thought best to go down with them
to arrest him; A. M. C. Smith and other officers
went with me; Colt's door was locked; there was
a slate on it saying Colt would be back at two
o'clock; an officer was at the foot of the stairs, ano-
ther at the head; we and Justice Taylor<u title=" add I (in file 0153)"> </u>sat in
Wheeler's room; we soon heard persons walking
in the entry, and found it was Mr. Colt and the offi-
cers who had arrested him; I told Mr. Colt who I
was, and we all went into his rooms and closed the
door; I told him then he was arrested, on suspi-
cion of causing the death of Adams; we searched
him, and he assisted us in showing us what he had
with him; I showed him the affidavits, and he read
them, to see what he was charged with<u>; He</u> was
taken to my office, Mr. Selden sent for, and Colt
was committed; that night I sent an advertise-
ment to the papers calling for the carman who took
the box from the Granite Buildings; we found the
carman through Mr. Godrey, as he stated next
day, Saturday; from that carman we found he had
taken the box to the ship Kalamazoo; we went on
board the ship that night; could not find the book
of the packages that night; next day we found the
box; I assisted in getting out the box myself; we
took it to the second <u title="deck">dock</u>, and I was there when
it was opened; I was not sufficiently near to the
box to see any substance like salt, even if it had
been there; I saw the box sent to the dead house.

   Justice T<small>AYLOR</small> <i>examined</i>—On Thursday, 23d
Sept. last, I was sent for by the Mayor; I took
	...
   W<small>ITNESS</small> <i>examined</i>—On the Saturday morning
Mr. Samuel Colt called on me, and told me his bro-
ther lived at 42 some street (thought it was Thomas
street); he then said it was near Franklin <u title="square (in file 0153)">street</u>;
however, from information he gave me, I found he
lived at 42 Monroe street; I went there and asked
for Mrs. Colt; was introduced to a woman as Mrs.
Colt; asked what room she occupied; and from a
recess near the door she drew out a trunk; I asked
her for Mr. Colt's trunk; she gave me his trunk.
   [Here the trunk was brought into Court, and
placed on the table before the jury. It was a plain
square black trunk, about two feet six inches long,
and 16 inches wide, and 18 inches deep.
   Mr. S<small>ELDEN</small> objected to the introduction of the
trunk, because the statements of a third party did
not make this trunk the property of Mr. Colt.
   Mr. S<small>MITH</small> said they had a right to introduce
their testimony when they pleased.
   Mr. S<small>ELDEN</small> said the trunk was not legal evi-
dence as yet; at the best it was only hearsay evi-
dence, and was not admissible. It must be proved
to be testimony in itself, before it could be intro-
duced in evidence. It must be proved to be Mr.
Colt's trunk first. What this woman said to Jus-
tice Taylor cannot be evidence between the people
and the prisoner.
   Judge K<small>ENT</small> said—He should exclude the state-
ments of this woman; but shall Justice Taylor
show that he got this trunk from Mr. Colt's resi-
dence, and show what are the contents of that
trunk. We shall allow him to do so.
   Mr. <u>E<small>MMETT</small></u> said there was nothing to connect
Mr. Colt with 42 Monroe street as yet.
   Mr. W<small>HITING</small> said that if they did not prove
more than that they would let the <u title="trunk">taunk</u> go for no-
thing.
   Witness continued—The trunk was taken from
3d story—front room. Officer Dennison was with
me. The female who drew it out went to the of-
fice with me. Colt was brought into the room,
and saw me and her. He could have seen the trunk
from the position in which he stood. I did not
open it in his presence. It is now as it was then. I
found several books in it. One had a name in it. There
is more in the trunk now than then. [The trunk
was here opened,] a book with a name in it, taken
out, with<u title=" “"> </u>J. Caldwell Colt” written on it. Several
stereotype advertisement heads of “Colt's Book-
keeping,” on them—600 cards with “Colt's Lec-
tures” on them.
   W<small>ITNESS</small>.—I took a watch from the trunk—it is
not now in it.
   The Deputy Coroner here produced a gold
watch with a string and key attached to it.
   W<small>ITNESS</small>.—That is the watch I took out of the
box; the watch passed ultimately to the hands of
the coroner, at the Coroner's inquest.
   <i>Cross-examined</i>.—We first went to Mr. White,
watchmaker in the Bowery, to see who made the
watch; he sent us to Dubois, Fulton street; there
we learned he had turned the case by an engine; he
sent us to a watch case maker in John street, for
whom he made the watch; and he sent us to Platt
& Brothers; Chilton was in Colt's room with us;
he scraped from the wall on the west side
of the room, rather nearer the door than
the centre of the room, and quite high
up; at one time we stood on a chair. The spots
there were larger than elsewhere; it was as high
as a man's head. The spots were not very large
there. On the 21th of September the carpenters
cut a piece out of the floor; it was right opposite
the first folding door towards the entry; it was on
the north east square of the room, if it was divided
into four parts. It was ten inches long and six
inches wide; we took it up there because there
was a darker spot than anywhere else. There was

   C<small>OLT'S</small> T<small>RIAL</small>—D<small>UDLEY</small> S<small>ELDEN</small>.—We have no-
ticed the remarks and the motion made yesterday
by Dudley Selden, in the Court of Oyer and Ter-
miner, relative to an Extra Herald, published on
Thursday evening.
   After the termination of the trial, we shall take
up the point of Mr. Selden's harangue, and show
that he had not the slightest foundation to attribute
to us any desire—any wish—any intention to preju-
dice Colt before the jury or the community. We
are very much astonished at this conduct, on the
part of Mr. <u title="Selden">Seldon</u>, because we have always consid-
ered him a superior man—of great tact—and equal
industry and genius. But we forbear further remark
till this trial is over.

				F<small>OURTH</small> D<small>AY</small>—S<small>ATURDAY</small>.
   The crowd, the interest, and the excitement,
consequent upon this trial increases, with every
succeeding day.
   This (Saturday) morning the Court met at ten
o'clock, and then allowed the Jurors to go home to
their families to change their clothes, &c. in charge
of sworn officers. The Court then adjourned over
for an hour.
		S<small>ECOND</small> S<small>ITTING</small>.
   The Court met again at eleven o'clock. Colt
was occupied all the morning, as usual, in reading
the newspapers, particularly the debates in Con-
gress on the Bankrupt Law.
   Before examining any witnesses, it was found
that the lid, of the box in which Adam's body was
found was missing. This was a most important link
in the testimony; we are told it was left in charge
of the Coroner; but of this we know nothing. It
seems that the lid has either been accidentally or
purposely, stolen, bought, sold, burnt, or otherwise
got rid of. This is worth remembering.
   Judge N<small>OAH</small> made his appearance in Court this
morning, and sat by the side of the counsel for the
prosecution. The crowd in the Court and out of
it, was very great.
   Mr. W<small>HITING</small> first called the Mayor to the stand,
and asked him to produce the articles he found in
Colt's room.
   R<small>OBERT</small> H. M<small>ORRIS</small> <i>examined</i>.—After Mr. Colt's
room was locked up by the officers, I had the key,
	...
   <i>Cross-examined</i>.—I had charge of Colt's room
	...
pocket book was handed to the Mayor,) and he
read the following as an envelope of one of the pa-
pers:
   “Hair of Sarah Colt, mother, and Margaret Colt,
deceased.”
   Here Colt for the first time during the trial
evinced considerable emotion, and at last burst into
tears, covered his face with his hands and wept
bitterly for some time.
   The Mayor also read as follows:—
   “Letters to my little old Aunt, also one to E. B.
Hedman and one to E. W. Carr.”
   Also, several endorsements thus:—
“Little old Aunt, No. 1		“Little old Aunt, No. 5
	“	“	2			“	“		6
	“	“	3			“	“		7
	“	“	4			“	“		8
	 	 	 			“	“		9
   These the Mayor said were found by him in
Colt's room.
   M<small>AYOR</small>.—There were a great many books and
papers found there, and a hatchet found there which
was given to Mr. Chilton; I saw the Assistant Co-
roner have the hatchet.
   <i>Here the hatchet, a small common hatchet, like the Ro-
binson hatchet, was produced</i>.
   M<small>AYOR</small>.—This hatchet was given to Mr. Chilton
in the state I found it.
   By S<small>ELDEN</small>.—I found no rope or pieces of rope
round that trunk.
   D<small>AVID</small> K<small>ELSO</small>, <i>examined</i>.—Is 38 years old; live
at 42 Monroe street; am a pilot; knew John C. Colt;
first saw him middle last May; he came to board at
my sister-in-law's where I boarded; a lady came
with him; she was called Mrs. Colt; they lived
together as man and wife; ate at the same table
with our family; had front room third story; they
brought two black trunks and a carpet bag with
them.
   (<u title="SELDEN">S<small>ELDON</small></u> admitted that the <u title="trunk">trunks</u> produced last
night was one one the trunks.)
	...
   Dr. J. R. C<small>HILTON</small>, <i>examined</i>.—Am a
practical chemist, I was called to Colt's
room in the Granite Buildings on the twenty-
fourth of September. My attention was first di-
rected to a spot on the floor which had been oiled
over on the west side of the wall. I saw some very
small spots of blood about one-eight of an inch in
diameter; I removed these spots for examination.
There were an immense number of spots of blood
on the folding doors, but very minute. I also had
a hatchet given me in charge (hatchet identified)
also a piece of the floor. I applied my chemical
tests to the spots from the wall, and to some spots
I got from the hammer end of the hatchet, and also
from the handle, and they proved to be blood; the
end of the hatchet handle had been covered with
ink. I also examined a piece of the floor, and in
the crack the dust looked red—this also gave an
indication of blood. Under the oil the board had
a reddish appearance, like blood. I also examined
a piece of paper given me by Justice Taylor.
   [Here Mr. Chilton produced a copy of the “New
York Herald,” of June 13, 1841; it was also literal-
ly covered with blood on both sides. The hatchet
and piece of floor was handed to the jurors.]
	...
   Mr. M<small>ILLIKEN</small>.—I have made search <i>for the lid
of the box, but it is lost</i>. It was placed in a cell in
the halls of justice leading from the police office,
or communicating with that office; I have not
seen the lid for two months past; almost every one
of the debtor's side of the prison has access to the
cell; it was put into the cell with the coat, cloths,
&c.
   [Here the witness stated that the box and cloths
were still very offensive; that the coat and stock
were less so; and the shirt; and he was ordered to
bring them at once into Court.]
   <i>Cross-examined</i>—These articles were never re-
moved to any other place in Leonard street. The
box was moved from one part of the city prison
to the other, but not the cover. They were all
placed in a cell with a stone bottom, plastered over
head about four feet wide by 10 or 12 feet long; <u title="it's">its</u>
a perfectly tight cell except the window.
	...
   By <u>E<small>MMET</small></u>—The box was never put into a cell;
it was moved from the hall to the yard; it was af-
terwards moved up to the upper part of the prison;
all those things were put first in the hall of the
Egyptian Tombs, and then taken into that cell in
the debtor's side of the prison; and never removed
thence; the <i>box lid</i> was put there too.
   <u title="Abraham B. Purdy (elsewhere)">A. D. P<small>URDY</small></u> <i>examined</i>—I am a Deputy Keeper
of the Tombs; the box was placed over the grand
jury room; I never saw the cover of the box; never
knew where it was put; knew nothing about it;
	...
   M<small>ALACHI</small> F<small>ALLON</small> <i>examined</i>—Is a deputy
keeper of the prison. Knows nothing about the
cover; never saw it; searched this morning where
Milliken said it was; could not find it. There are
padlocks on all the cells.
   <i>Cross-Examined</i>—Have no recollection of offer-
ing to bet Godfrey. There were bets offered by
half a dozen; can't say if he offered to bet, or I of-
fered to bet.
   C<small>HILTON</small> <i>recalled</i> by S<small>ELDEN</small>—<i>There would be no
new composition or decomposition if salt and chloride
of lime are put in a box together</i>.
   By W<small>HITING</small>—If a dead body were put into a box</l9>
<d>[Col.2]</d>
<l9>there would be no exhumation from it resembling
salt.
   R<small>OBERT</small> W. B<small>OWYER</small> <i>examined</i>.—Was called on
in September last by <u title="Delnoce (elsewhere)">Delnose</u>, to go to the granite
buildings, about some difficulty that had occurred;
he could not tell what it was; it was late in the af-
ternoon; he heard a noise, clashing of foils or
something; I had a young man arrested—with me—
just returned from Yorkville; could not go
then; promised to go in half an hour; asked some
other officers to go, but they did not or would not
go. I was delayed with my prisoner longer than I
expected. The next morning I met the young man
in the street, and asked him what the difficulty was,
he told me it <u>did'nt</u> amount to anything, or some-
thing of that kind.
	...
   By W<small>HITING</small>—I think I may have seen him<u> </u>Bell's
auction-room next day; he didn't find fault with
me, but asked why I didn't come. I told him. He
said it didn't amount to anything.
   Mrs. M<small>ERCY</small> <u>O<small>CTON</small></u> <i>examined</i>—Am the wife of
<u title="Lowe Hockton (elsewhere)">Low Octon</u>. Know the prisoner at the bar. Was
	...
   J<small>AMES</small> E. H<small>YDE</small>, <i>examined</i>—Is keeper of the
city prison; the box and lid was not put under my
charge; the box was put up in the attic part; as the
only part where it could be put under lock and key;
I gave Mr. Milliken a cell to put the things in;
knew nothing of the cover of the box.
   <i>Cross-examined</i>.—I gave the Deputy Coroner a
cell in the watch house corridor to put the things
in, and gave him the key; he's had it ever since;
the locks used to be all alike, but padlocks have
been put on; <i>I presume they are different locks</i>; the
key of that cell will not unlock the two next
to it.
   Capt S<small>WAIN</small>.—Is one of the turnkeys; knows
nothing about the cover of the box; never saw it.
   Mr. A<small>STEN</small>.—Is one of the deputy keepers of the
city prison; knows nothing about “<i>that box or
kiver</i>” or the cell or the key.
   Mr. H. P<small>ATRICK</small> <i>examined</i>—Knows nothing about
	...
   Mr. H<small>UTTON</small> <i>examined</i>—Is deputy keeper of the
	...
   Mr. L<small>UMMERE</small> <i>examined</i>—Is engineer of the pri-
son. Knows the cell the things were put in. Mrs.
Lawrence, who looks after the prisoners, told me
she saw the watchman break the cell open to get
wood out. I locked the cell and gave Mr. <u title="Milliken">Milliner</u>
the key, when he put the things in.
   J<small>OHN</small> D<small>AVIS</small> <i>examined</i>—Is a police officer. Don't
know the box—never see it. I know <i>that</i> cell—
there was a strong smell come from it; I was asked
by the watchman if I'd like to see the box Mr.
Adams was in, or that made the smell; I said no.
The cells along that watch corridor were frequent-
ly left open.
   Mr. M<small>ILLIKEN</small> <i>recalled</i>—Never left that cell door
open; never found it open; this is the key; I have
kept it in my possession. <i>I've no doubt there are a
great many keys to fit that same padlock among the
police officers and watch. It is a very common lock</i>.
   He here produced the coat, stock, and shirt of
Adams.
   Dr. G<small>ILMAN</small> <i>examined</i>—Is a practising physician;
	...</l9>
<d>[Col.3]</d>
<l9>	...
   [A cast of the head was here produced, marked
by the doctor, and shown to the jury. By this it
appeared that all the forehead, right and left, was
beaten in, and the right eyebrow and part of the
cheek, but the left eyebrow was not beaten in.]
	...
   Here the Court adjourned for an hour, at half
past 3.
			<b>Afternoon Session.</b>
   Dr. G<small>ILMAN</small> <i>examined</i>—There was no cleansing
of the body at the time I examined it; we examined
	...
   By a J<small>UROR</small>.—If a body had lain on its face
eight <u>day's</u> would the sail-cloths absorbed much of
the brain?</l9>
<d>[Col.4]</d>
<l9>   Dr. <u title="GILMAN">G<small>ILMIN</small></u>.—No. After death the body appears
moist.
   Dr. <u title="KISSAM">KISSMAN</u> <i>examined</i>.—Was present at examina-
	...
   Dr. A<small>RCHER</small>.—Is coroner, and a physician; was
present at the preliminary part of the post mortem
examination. Heard Dr. <u title="Gilman">Gillman</u> testify; agreed
with him in his description of the injuries on that
scull; don't think I ever knew a scull that had been
pierced by a bullet; don't think this hatchet could
produce that round hole; I took a ring from the
little finger of the right hand, and showed it to
Mrs. Adams.
	...
   Dr. K<small>ISSAM</small> <i>re-called</i>—The body was that of the
ordinary muscular power; about 130 to 140; not a
fat man; the muscles were fully developed.
   Mrs. E<small>MELINE</small> A<small>DAMS</small> <i>examined</i>—(She was in
deep mourning. Her appearance created much
sensation in Court; she was not at all agitated.)
My husband's name was Samuel Adams; he would
have been 30 on the 2d day of October; he was a
printer. His place of business was corner of Gold
and Ann. He had a foreman named Monahan; he
was last home alive the 17th day of Sept. at noon
—between 12 and 1 o'clock. He ate dinner at home.
He left home a little before 1, I think. Don't
know where he intended to go when he left home.
He never returned home again that day. Nor the
next day. The first advertisement was put in the
Tuesday's paper. It appeared in Wednesday's pa-
per. He had on a black coat, buff vest, of a kind
of corded stuff, cotton; and mixed pantaloons,
gambroon; cotton shirt; a black stock round his
neck; he wore a ring on the smallest finger; I
don't know which hand; his name <u title="was not on (in file 0161 - EXTRA HERALD)">was on</u> his shirt.
I did not see the body at the dead house. A ring
was shown to me by the Coroner at the Inquest.—
I think that I can say that that is the ring he wore.
The stock was shown to me; I recognised that;
The coat I saw; it was his. (Here the coat and
stock was produced.) I made the stock myself.—
The body was afterwards buried from my father's
house. He had a watch on when he left home that
day, with a chain and key attached. (Watch shown
to her.) I know the watch and key; wore the key
2 years myself; know it by the dents in it, bit
them myself; he had that watch at dinner that day;
I'd been into the country five or six weeks, and
got home on the 14th September. He hadn't it
when I went away; about the 15th he sat on the
foot of the bed, I took the key off from my watch
and put it on his, and took the pincers and tried to
get the dents out. The day or two before he was
missed (Wednesday or Thursday evening) we
were out visiting at Mr. Concklin's, 90 Chatham
street.
   We never saw a witness evince so little feeling.
   There was no cross-examination.
   H<small>UGH</small> M<small>ONAHAN</small> <i>examined</i>—Is a printer; knew
Adams; was his foreman; at corner of Gold and
Ann st.; was his foreman 14 months; there was
business transactions between him and Colt; I
knew Colt personally, Mr. Adams printed Mr.
Colt's book-keeping; Mr. Sparks, the administrator
has his books; he made his own entries in his
books; Mr. Adams left his office, corner of Gold st.
and Ann st., on Friday, Sept. 17th, at 3 o'clock P. M.;
	...
back. He was missing three days before the ad-
vertisement was published. I wrote the advertise-
ment on Tuesday; first published on Wednesday
morning. Mr. Colt was in Adams' office about a
week before Adams was missing; after this never
saw Colt there till after the advertisement was pub-
lished. When he was missed, Colt's work was
finished. On Tuesday, September 23d, I saw Colt.
He called at Adams' office, and inquired for Mr.
Adams; between 10 and 12 o'clock; the day after
the advertisement was published. He inquired of
me. I was in the second story. He came in rather
suddenly upon me, and asked whether Mr. Adams
was in. I said he was not; he said he'd seen ad-
vertisement in newspapers, saying he was missing;
I told him he'd been missing since the previous
Friday, at 3 o'clock. I don't know as he replied.
I observed if I'd known where his office was,
I should have called <u title="on him to (in file 0161)">on to</u> know when he'd seen
Mr. Adams last. He then said Mr. Adams done his
printing for three years, and had always found
him kind and accommodating to him. A gentle-
man then came in about some work, and Colt in-
troduced himself to him, and they had some con-
versation together. I don't know what it was. I
told Colt his plates, and part of his sheets were in
the office. He desired me to take care of them.
He told me of some work Mr. Adams had done,</l9>
<d>[Col.5]</d>
<l9>and Mr. <u title="Wells (in file 0161)">Willis</u> had bound. I don't know what it
was; I saw it interested Mr. Wells, and referred
him to Mr. Wells. Adams had his watch with
him the day he was missing, and a plain gold
ring; I asked him if he didn't owe Mr. Adams
about $200; he replied that he owed him about $50;
he then left me, and went over to see Mr. Wells;
he was a bookbinder in Gold street, nearly opposite
Mr. Adams; saw Colt no more till his arrest.
	...
   A Juror here expressed a wish for longer ses-
sion. The Court said they'd meet at <u title="nine (in file 0161)">three</u> o'clock
hereafter, and sit later.
   <i>That box</i> was ordered to be brought in. It was
so.
   Judge K<small>ENT</small> again gave his usual instructions to
the Jurors as to how they were cautiously to act
during the interval between Saturday night and
Monday morning. Speak to no one on the trial,
and only move in the custody of officers. He said
the Juror's Room should be provided for their use
on Sunday; and they might go to church in a
body.
   Mr. W<small>HITING</small> was afraid this might give rise to
exceptions hereafter, if they heard a sermon about
this matter, as influencing their verdict.<u title="This line is from file 0161, EXTRA HERALD">
   Judge H<small>UNT</small> said that</u>
   Judge C<small>OWAN</small> had decided on this matter, if the
prisoner consented they might <u title="consent (in file 0161)">conset</u> to this. The
prisoner, Mr. Colt, consented that the jury should
go to church.
   <i>That box</i> was brought in amidst a terrible
commotion, rising from seats, and rattling of
staves. The box was put before the jury.
The quantity of canvass—old sail-cloth—was really
tremendous; as much as would make a large awn-
ing. There were four <u title="nails (in file 0161)">rails</u> projecting in on one
side of the box; projecting into the box about three
quarters of an inch. And three on the other side of
the box. There were two <u title="cleats">cleets</u> on each end of the
box, through which the nails were driven. The end
pieces at one end were three, and at the other were
two. The bottom consisted of two <u title="pieces (in file 0161)">peices</u>, and the
sides of two pieces.
   Mr. M<small>ILLIKEN</small> <i>continued</i>.—The body laid nearer
the top than the bottom of the box. There was a
space of six or eight inches between the head and
feet of the body and the ends of the box; between
these ends and the body there was stuffed some
oakum and a quantity of this sail cloth. The head
was drawn down to nearly the knees, on the
breast.
   By a J<small>UROR</small>.—The body laid on the back.
   The Court directed Mr. M<small>ILLIKEN</small> to examine
the cloths and see if there were any nail holes in
them.
   The Court then adjourned, 'till Monday, at 10
o'clock.
   The smell from the cloths and box was most in-
tolerable.</l9>

	<b>CASE OF BENJAMIN RATHBUN.</b>
				——
   <m9>From the Buffalo Commercial Advertiser and Journal.</m9>
<l9>   By the letter below it will be seen that Governor
S<small>EWARD</small> has again refused to exercise the pardon-
ing power in favor of <i>Benjamin Rathbun</i>.
   No more delicate duty devolves upon the Execu-
tive than that of a just and discriminative exercise
of that power. He holds it as the conservator of
the rights of the community and the convict, and
the responsibility thrown upon him is often immense
and of the most painful character. As the imper-
sonation of the principle of justice in the most ex-
tensive sense, he is bound to suppress all those sym-
pathies in which others feel at liberty to indulge,
or yield to them only so far as they are not incom-
patible with the reverence due to the majesty of the
offended laws. The decision of Gov. S<small>EWARD</small> in
the case of <i>Rathbun</i>, will, we think, upon cool re-
flection, command the approbation of every good
citizen:
				B<small>UFFALO</small>, May 9, 1842.
<i>To the Editors of the Commercial Advertiser</i>:
   G<small>ENT.</small>: I send you the enclosed communication,
just received from Governor S<small>EWARD</small>, without com-
ment, which I think should be made public by an
insertion in your paper.			S. S. CASE.
				E<small>XECUTIVE</small> D<small>EPARTMENT</small>,	}
					Albany, May 5, 1842.	}
   Several respectable citizens, some of whom reside
in Buffalo, and others in Batavia, together with more
than fifty members of the Legislature representing
various parts of the state, have united in expressing
a wish that I would reconsider <a class="l" href="#American-1840-06-05">my decision</a> made in
May, 1840, denying an application for a pardon to
<i>Benjamin Rathbun</i>.

		CITY INTELLIGENCE.
<m9>				——		F<small>RIDAY</small>, May 27.
	...
   In the Supreme Court the case of Madame Restell,
(brought up on a writ of error,) in relation to the death of
Mrs. Purdy, was argued by Mr. Jordan for the accused and
Mr. Whiting for the People. The defence is that the depo-
sition of Mrs. Purdy, taken before Justice Merritt, is illegal,
the counsel for Madame R. not being present. The Court
will render its decision in due course.
   C<small>ASE OF</small> J<small>OHN</small> C. C<small>OLT</small>.—The Bill of Exceptions in this
case was called up. Messrs. Selden and <u>Morrell</u>, counsel for
prisoner, had been in Court during the forenoon, but were
absent on the cause being announced. The Court ordered
a nonsuit, and directed the District Attorney to proceed by
default. The Court of Oyer will probably pass to sentence
at the end of the present term.
   C<small>ASE OF</small> A<small>USTIN</small> R<small>ANKIN</small>.—This young man had been
convicted of a rape on the person of Jane Ann Toole, and
the cause had been brought up on a writ of error. New
trial denied, and the case sent back to the Court below, with
orders to proceed to sentence.</m9>

   Present, Judge Ulshoeffer, President, Judges Ingraham

and the Board of Aldermen.
   Judge Lynch, was also in Court and took a seat.
   Judge Ulshoeffer, said the Court had met pursuant to
adjournment, to test the title of the associate Judges of
the Courts of Sessions to seats in this Court.
   Alderman Davies rose and read a lengthy list of com-
piled legal opinions and sections of statutes, in favor of
Messrs. Lynch and Noah taking their seats as members
	...
   His Honor the Mayor, rose and stated that upon a full
and careful examination into the subject as to the right
of the Associate Judges of the Court of Sessions to sit
in this Court, he had come to the conclusion that the
Court of Common Pleas of the city and county, com-
posed of the County Court of the city and county, there-
fore the question would simply be, have Messrs. Lynch
and Noah, who were appointed by the statute of May,
1840, with power, as Judges, merely to sit in the Court
of Sessions, a right to a seat as Judges or members
of this Court. Certainly they could not. This Consti-
	...
   A motion was then made to recognize the associate
judges as members generally of this court, which was
lost by a tie vote of 11 to 11, the Recorder and the 10
whig Aldermen voting in the affirmative, and the Mayor
and the Judges of the Court of Common Pleas and the 7
democratic Aldermen in the negative.

<d>[Col.3]</d>
		<b>Case of Madame Restell.</b>
<m9><i>To the Public and the Press</i>:
   It will be recollected that, about fifteen months since, the
undersigned was the object of much newspaper vitupera-
tion and abuse; every variety of opprobrious invective the
language afforded, was brought into requisition by which
to stigmatize the atrocious “woman.” No epithet was
considered too gross, too vile, to express the holy horror en-
tertained by the truly pure and purely virtuous writers of
the newspaper anathemas. Had the undersigned been con-
victed of the most foul and atrocious crime, stronger or
more bitter terms than those already lavished upon her,
would have been wanting—the vocabulary being in this par-
ticular, bankrupt.
   A reflecting and impartial mind would naturally inquire
the cause of all this malediction. Was it that the object of
it was tried and convicted, on proper and legal testimony,
of some unheard of and most horrid atrocity!—Of murder,
of manslaughter, of arson, or of some other heinous felony!
No, not so. <i>Worse than all this</i>. She was <i>charged</i> with the
commission of a <i>misdemeanor!</i> It was this charge, unsus-
tained (as the Supreme Court declare) by a particle of legal
testimony, which caused this mighty newspaper volcano to
burst upon her devoted head.
   An <i>exparte</i> affidavit was drawn up by one of the Police
clerks, embellished with the horrid, revolting, and disgust-
ing. This affidavit (which, be it remembered, was all there
was to sustain the charge upon trial) was seized with eager
zeal and greedy avidity, and published, far and near, long
before trial, accompanied with such virtuous outpourings,
as would lead one to suppose the writers to be either the
veriest saints or the veriest hypocrites in Christendom. Long
before trial it was settled that the accused was guilty. Every
person read one or more of the public journals, each of
which deemed it necessary or polite to say something about
the 'woman,' and thus lay claim to a proportion of morality,
since this was an opportunity to gain it cheaply, supposing,
doubtless, that he who prates loudest and longest against
“iniquity,” &c. will be sure to be considered excessively
virtuous.
   After public opinion was thus effectually poisoned, it is
neither reasonable nor probable to expect that the minds of
those individuals composing the Court before whom the
accused was yet to have a hearing, could be in a condition
for that calm, cool, and dispassionate adjudication, without
which, that intended to be safeguard and anchor of our
civil institutions—trial by jury—is an idle ceremony, a
mockery, a deception. Judges are but men—some of them
with minds not the strongest, or most clear, very often with
hankerings after popular favor—who will, in trying emer-
gencies, hesitate between their duty as impartial adminis-
trators of the law, and the possible personal consequences
of displeasing a supposed “public opinion.”
   I do not wish here to intimate that the Court of Sessions
acted from other than correct motives, notwithstanding that
it seems a “remarkably singular coincidence” that through-
out the whole of their proceedings against me, in not <i>one
single</i> particular, (so says the Supreme Court,) did they act
in accordance with the plainest, simplest, and best estab-
lished and most fundamental principles of common law,
statute, or precedent; but, on the contrary, in every in-
stance, doubtless unintentionally, violated the clearest and
dearest rights of every citizen. This is certainly singular;
extremely so. But so it is nevertheless. I intend merely to
suggest the gross impropriety and flagrant injustice of the
public press; thus, in effect, destroying the glorious privi-
lege of a fair, unbiased, and impartial trial by jury contem-
plated by the Constitution, as guaranteed to the veriest
wretch, though he should have the sins of the world to an-
swer for. How can this be attained, if, on the first blush of
a complaint, on an <i>ex parte</i> affidavit, however false, howev-
er unfounded, or however abandoned and wicked the party
by whom made, a simultaneous and savage yell from the
press astounds the public ear; the matter is seized hold of,
exaggerated, perverted, misrepresented, magnified; the
enormity of the <i>supposed</i> offence is freely and unreservedly
commented upon to exhaustion, as though the party, as yet
only accused, and whose innocence or guilt is yet to be tested,
were actually and beyond all <u title="peradventure">peraduenture</u>, guilty?
   But this is not all. This might, perhaps, be tolerated, if, on
finding themselves in the wrong or misled or deceived
they had the manly honesty to acknowledge themselves
premature in their surmises, and forthwith correct, with
the utmost publicity any error of judgement or of fact
into which they may have fallen. But not; not even
this partial act of common justice is scarcely ever ren-
dered. And I will venture to affirm that not one press
in ten, loud-mouthed in my abuse, will even lisp that the
Supreme Court have decided that the evidence upon which
a conviction was obtained against Madame Restell, was
illegal, unauthorized, and inadmissible. No. I expect it
not. I respectfully submit it to the press whether such a
course is not repugnant and dangerous “to the liberty of the
citizen,” certainly not less to be prized than the “liberty of
the press.”
   I take this opportunity to set the public right in relation
to the matter preferred against me, by presenting to their
notice such facts as will enable them to judge how much
credence is to be given to the affidavit of the miserable,
wicked, and abandoned woman, who affixed her signa-
ture to it.
   It will be recollected that in the affidavit, taken in March,
1841, she states that she called upon me, two and a half years
before, viz: in 1839. That on that occasion she gave me a
pledge-ticket, consisting of some articles enumerated. But
on the trial it was discovered that she had made a previous
affidavit, a year before, which was produced in Court,
swearing in that affidavit that she had lost that self-same
ticket, consisting of the same enumeration, by which oath
she succeeded it appeared in obtaining the articles pledged.
Here, then, she must have sworn falsely either in the one
affidavit or in the other. Either she swore false in stating
that she lost the ticket, or else she swore falsely in alleging
that she gave it to me. It did not appear in evidence upon
the trial that I ever had the pledge-ticket, except by her af-
fidavit, which was set aside by her previous affidavit, taken
a year before, in which she swears as having lost it. Had
this woman testified on the stand in open Court, or where
she would have been subjected to cross-examination, she
would have convicted herself of perjury. Such was the
character of the testimony upon which a conviction was ob-
tained, and it would have been surprising indeed if the Su-
preme Court would permit such proceedings to have passed
without administering a quiet, but severe and well-merited
rebuke.
   <a class="l" title="woman of ordinary intellect" href="#Tribune-1841-07-20-Dr-Marvin">Dr. Marvin, her family physician, testified</a> that “she was
a woman of <u>weak intellect, silly</u>, and easily influenced.”—
This being so, it was not to be wondered at that such a wo-
man, in the hands of her notoriously abandoned and despe-
rate husband, should have been prevailed upon to testify
in a manner which would have subjected her to the penal-
ties of the law. I wish the public to bear in mind that this
W. W. Purdy, her husband, testified under oath that he nev-
er made overtures to me, either personally or otherwise, to
compromise; when a gentleman, then one of the Grand
Jurors, came forward and testified as follows:
   “<a class="l" href="#Tribune-1841-07-21">Huron Betts, sworn for the defence</a>, deposed that he
knew W. W. Purdy—that he requested witness two or three
weeks ago to go to Madame Restell and ask her if she
would give him so much money to keep his witnesses away
from the Court. He did not name any particular sum.—
Witness went with Purdy from the Bowery down Chatham-
street, from Chatham-street to Broadway, and from Broad-
way down Cedar to the corner of Cedar and Greenwich-</m9>
<d>[Col.4]</d>
<m9>streets, where Purdy left witness, promising to meet him at
a barber's shop at or near the corner of Courtlandt-street.—
Witness went into the house of Madame Restell and saw a
woman.”
   The immateriality of this Purdy's testimony upon the
main question at issue was all that saved him from an in-
dictment for perjury and attempt to extort. Such was the
prosecution and such the testimony; and I refer with pride
and pleasure to the decision of the Supreme Court as a
shield and protection against injustice and oppression.
   I have, in conclusion, but one other point to broach upon.
The beautiful and high-wrought specimen of a literary com-
position, drawn up by one of the Clerks of the Police, be-
fore alluded to, contained, among other things, intended to
shock alike the moral sense and decency of the community,
the allegation that a “man,” hoodwinked, muffled up, and
wrapped up—doubtless, a very demon—was in attendance
on that special occasion. The composition, as a production
intended to be startingly horrid, would have been incom-
plete without some adjunct equally preposterous, ridiculous
and absurd. The only drawback upon it being that it is
false from beginning to end. I need only add that in no case
do I engage a “man” or physician, for the simple and all-
abundant reason that, whatever I undertake, I feel myself
competent, as well by study, experience and practice, to
carry through properly; and, so far from requiring a physi-
cian in my practice it is not unusual for me to be called for
in preference to a “doctor” in confinements, where a pro-
per delicacy forbids the presence of a male practitioner, and
also in such other cases in which it is more fitting and pro-
per, and more in consonance with our ideas of propriety,
that a lady, provided always she is skilful, should attend in
preference to a gentleman.
   It will be perceived that every one of the exceptions taken
by Mr. Jordan, on account of illegality, are sustained by the
Supreme Court. A sufficient commentary upon that gen-
tleman's legal acquirements, to whom I return my sincere
thanks for the faithful, able and fearless manner in which he
conducted himself throughout, regardless alike of the
frowns and caresses of all.

   <b>Supreme Court—The People <i>v.</i> Restell.</b>
<m9><l9>		O<small>PINION OF THE</small> C<small>OURT</small>.
   B<small>RONSON</small> J. The depositions of Mrs. Purdy, who had
died before the trial, were offered in evidence upon two
grounds—1st, as depositions taken <i>de bene esse</i>, in the Court
of General Sessions; and, 2d, as examinations before Mr.
Merritt, the committing magistrate. There is a difficulty in
the outset in allowing them to be read as depositions taken
in the General Sessions; for at the time they were taken
there was no suit or proceeding against the defendant pend-
ing in that Court. The defendant had just before been com-
mitted to prison by a magistrate on a criminal charge; but
no indictment had been found, and whether she would be
indicted, if at all, in the Sessions or the Oyer and Terminer,
was a question about which nothing could then be known.
I do not see how the Sessions could acquire jurisdiction of
the matter except by indictment found in that Court, or in
the Oyer and Terminer and transmitted to the Sessions for
trial. If the Court had no jurisdiction, the depositions are
extra-judicial, and consequently void. But as this difficulty
was not mentioned at the bar, there may be some legal pro-
vision on the subject which I have overlooked, or there may
have been an understanding between the counsel that the
objection should not be made. It is proper, therefore, to
consider the case upon the broad ground discussed at the
bar.
   Can the public prosecutor have depositions taken <i>de bene
esse</i> in criminal cases, and read them in evidence without
the consent of the defendant? I think he cannot. The gen-
eral rule certainly is, that the witnesses must appear in
Court and be confronted with the accused party. On trials
for homicide the dying declarations of the person murdered
may be given in evidence against the defendant. This is,
I think, the only exception to the general rule which has
been mentioned, except such as are based upon some statute
law. A practice sprung up in this State at an early day, of
taking depositions <i>de bene esse</i> in civil suits, which were af-
terward read in evidence on proof of the death or absence
of the witness. [Mumford v. Church, 1 John. Cas. 147;
Sandford v. Burrell, Anth. N. P. 184; Jackson v. Kent,
Cow. 59; Wait v. Whitney, id. 69; Packard v. Hill, id. 489.]
This practice has since been sanctioned by the Legislature
[<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=OUwwAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA391">2 R. S. 391, Art. 1</a>] But this statute does not, nor does the
prior practice extend to criminal cases.
   We are referred to another statute, which provides that
“the proceedings prescribed by law in civil cases, in respect
to the <u title="impaneling">impanneling</u> of juries, the keeping them together,
and the manner of rendering their verdict, shall be had upon
trials of indictment; and the provisions of law in civil cases
relative to compelling the attendance and testimony of wit-
nesses, their examination, the administration of oaths and af-
firmations, and proceedings as for contempts to enforce the
remedies and protect the rights of parties, shall extend to
trials and other proceedings on indictments, so far as they
may be in their nature applicable thereto, subject to the
provisions contained in any statute.” [<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=OUwwAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA735">2 R. S. 735, sec. 14</a>.]
It was not the object of this section to give new remedies in
criminal cases, but to direct the mode in which existing
remedies should thereafter be applied. “The provisions of
law in civil cases,” in relation to the matters particularly
specified, are extended to like proceedings on indictments;
but it is only “so far as they may be in their nature appli-
cable thereto.” Much stress has been laid upon the words
“their examination,” as applied to witnesses. But those
words must be restricted to cases where the examination
was already provided for by law; and there is ample scope
for their operation. They apply where the witness is pro-
duced in court, when he is examined on commission, and
when examined conditionally at the instance of the defend-
ant. [<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=OUwwAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA731">2. R. S. 731, sec. 73, 75</a>.] The Legislature did not in-
tend by this general provision in relation to the forms and
mode of proceeding in criminal cases to introduce a new
rule into the law of evidence. This is the more evident
from the fact that special provision had already been made
in the same chapter for the examination of witnesses out of
court. After issue joined upon the indictment, the defend-
ant may have a commission to examine witnesses residing
out of the State, and the prosecuting officer may join in the
commission and name witnesses on the part of the people.
[2 R. S. 731, sec. 73.] After having thus especially provided
for particular cases, it is impossible to suppose that the Le-
gislature, in the general provision which follows on page
735, sec. 14, intended to cover an entirely new class of cases,
and provide for the examination of witnesses <i>de bene esse</i> on
the part of the people.
	...</l9></m9>

<m9><l9>	...
   In this case the first and principal deposition was origin-
ally prepared and sworn in the <u title="defendant">defendent</u>'s absence, and
could not therefore be used on the trial, unless the difficulty
was obviated on what took place after the arrest. And here
there are several objections. Although the defendant con-
sented to go with the Justice to the house of Mrs. Purdy
without waiting for the return of her husband with counsel,
she gave the consent on being told by the Justice that the
only object in going was to have the defendant identified by
the witness. When they got to the house, the Justice not
only prepared an affidavit identifying the defendant, but he
proceeded to re-swear the witness to the original deposition,
and did what, as is now said, will make that paper good
evidence against the defendant. Although nothing wrong
was intended, I think this was not a proper course of pro-
ceeding. The husband had gone after counsel for the very
purpose of having assistance on the examination, and if the
defendant had been made to understand how much was to
be done on this visit to Mrs. Purdy, it is highly probable that
she would have declined going there until sufficient time
had been allowed for the return of her husband. There
was no occasion for urging the woman away with so much
haste after she had desired to have counsel, and when the
return of her husband might be expected within fifteen or
twenty minutes. The witness, so far as appears, was not
then dangerously ill, and she did not die until the lapse of
more than a month from that time. The language of the
statute is, “if desired by the person arrested, his counsel
may be present during the examination.” 2 R. S. 703, §14.
A reasonable time after the arrest should be allowed for the
employment of counsel, and I think the Justice misjudged
of his duty in proceeding to an examination before a rea-
sonable time had elapsed for the return of the husband.
   But what was this supposed examination of the witness?
The Justice did not pursue the course which was adopted
in Rex <i>vs.</i> Smith—the case on which the District Attorney
relies. In that case the magistrates in the first place <i>re-
swore</i> the witness in the presence of the prisoner, and then
very distinctly and slowly read over so much of the depo-
sition as had been previously written. The witness was
then asked whether what had been written was true, and
what he meant to say; and he answered, that it was per-
fectly correct. The magistrates then proceeded and com-
pleted the deposition. There was an examination of the
witness <i>on oath</i> and <i>in the presence of the prisoner</i>, and when
the direct examination was through the prisoner was in-
vited to cross-examine. How was it here? The Justice
<i>without swearing</i> the witness to answer questions touching
the complaint, read over the original affidavits, then pre-
pared another and read that; and then swore the witness to
both depositions in the gross. After all had been thus com-
pleted, the defendant was told that she could put questions.
She did put questions; but if the witness had answered
falsely, she could not have ben convicted of perjury. She
had just sworn that the depositions were true; but she had
not sworn to answer questions at all. The whole matter
was accomplished and the parties left the house within
twenty or thirty minutes after they had entered it. It will
never do to hold this, such an examination as will make the
depositions evidence against the accused. The witness was
not examined “on oath, in the presence of the prisoner,” as
the statute requires. <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=OUwwAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA708">2 R. S. 708, §13</a>. In our zeal to punish
crime, great care should be taken not to make precedents
which may prove dangerous to the innocent, and it should
never be forgotten that even the guilty have rights which
should be scrupulously regarded.
   I think the Justice also erred in not giving the answer of
the witness to the questions put by way of cross-examina-
tion. If, as the Justice understands the matter, “there was,
in point of fact, but one question,” and the defendant “put
the same question over and over again,” it is evident that
the defendant thought that a very material inquiry. The
Justice does not deny that the questions and answers were
pertinent, but he thought it was not material to put them
down; and the reason assigned is, that “the answer had
been given before any question was put by Madame Res-
tell, <i>as witness considered</i>, and was already in the affidavit.”
It must be recollected that this was the first time that the
witness had been confronted with the accused, and if the
witness had answered the same question before, it was when
she did not stand face to face with the defendant. The
statute provides that the magistrate shall proceed “to ex-
amine the complainant and the witnesses produced in sup-
port of the prosecution on oath, in the presence of the pris-
oner, in regard to the offence charged, and in regard to any
other matters connected with such charge, which such ma-
gistrate may deem pertinent.” (2 R. S. 708, §13.) <u title="“"> </u>The evi-
dence given by the several witnesses examined shall be re-
duced to writing by the magistrate, or under his direction,
and shall be signed by the witnesses respectively.” (§19)
I see nothing in these provisions to warrant the magistrate
in refusing to take down the answers to pertinent questions
put upon the cross-examination. If the same question is put
more than once and receives a uniform answer, one inser-
tion in the deposition will be enough; but I see no reason
why the answer should be rejected altogether.
   When the examination is produced and the magistrate
swears that it was taken in pursuance of the statute, and
nothing appears to the contrary, it may be presumed that
all the necessary forms were duly observed. (The People
vs. Moore, 15 Wend. 419.) But it may be, and was shown
in this case that the deposition was not duly taken.</l9></m9>
<d>[Col.6]</d>
<m9><l9>   It was thought important on the trial to prove that there
was a subsequent offer by the magistrate to examine the
witnesses for the People in presence of the defendant and
her counsel, and to allow a cross-examination. But this
could not aid the defective depositions which had been
taken ten days before the offer was made. If it was not
then too late, the Justice should have gone on and had an
examination <i>de novo</i>, instead of contenting himself with
making a proposition to that effect.
	...
   The objection is presented in another and a more conclu-
sive form. The principal deposition when offered on the
trial purported to be a deposition in the court of “General
Sessions of the peace in and for the city and county of New
York,” and to have been taken pursuant to an order of that
court. And although the defendant excepted to the evid-
ence, the District Attorney was permitted to prove by parol
that it was a deposition taken before the committing magis-
trate. The case comes plainly within the general rule that
a written document shall not be contradicted or impeached
on parol evidence. And besides, there are decisions going
to the precise point under consideration. The prisoner is
to be examined without being sworn. In the King v. Smith
1 Stark Rep. 242, the examination of the defendant was re-
jected because it purported to have been taken on oath, and
Le Blanc J. refused to receive evidence that no oath had in
fact been administered to the defendant. A like decision
was made in Rex v. Rivers, 7 C. & P. 177. 1 Phil. Er. 113,
114, 370. In Rex v. Walter, 7 C. & P. and 67, the written ex-
amination of the prisoner stated that he had answered, “I
decline to say any thing,” and Lord Abinger would not al-
low the prosecutor to prove that the prisoner had made a
confession of his guilt when under examination, before the
magistrate. After these papers had been turned into deposi-
tions in the court of General Sessions, they could only be
used for what they were worth as depositions taken in that
court. They could not be reformed by parol evidence into
depositions before the committing magistrate. In every
view which I have been able to take of the case, the deposi-
tions were improperly admitted.

		<b>Case of Madame Restell.</b>
<m9><i>To the Public and the Press</i>:
   It will be recollected that, about fifteen months since, the un-
dersigned was the object of much newspaper vituperation and
abuse; every variety of opprobrious invective the language af-
forded, was brought into requisition by which to stigmatize the
atrocious “woman.” No epithet was considered too gross, too
vile, to express the holy horror entertained by the truly pure
and the purely virtuous writers of the newspaper anathemas.—
Had the undersigned been convicted of the most foul and atro-
cious crime, stronger or more bitter terms than those already
lavished upon her, would have been wanting—the vocabulary
being in this particular, bankrupt.
	...
   It will be recollected that in the affidavit, taken in March,
1841, she states that she called upon me, two and a half years be-
fore, viz: in 1839. That on that occasion she gave me a pledge-
ticket, consisting of some articles enumerated. But on the trial
it was discovered that she had made a previous affidavit, a year
before, which was produced in Court, swearing in that affidavit
that she had lost that self-same ticket, consisting of the same
enumeration, by which oath she succeeded, it appeared, in ob-
taining the articles pledged. Here, then, she must have sworn
falsely either in the one affidavit or in the other. Either she
swore false in stating that she lost the ticket, or else she swore
falsely in alleging that she gave it to me. It did not appear in evi-
dence upon the trial that I ever had the pledge-ticket except by
her affidavit, which was set aside by her previous affidavit, taken
a year before, in which she swears as having lost it. Had this
woman testified on the stand in open Court, or where she
would have been subjected to cross-examination, she would
have convicted herself of perjury. Such was the character of
the testimony upon which a conviction was obtained, and it
would have been surprising indeed if the Supreme Court would
permit such proceedings to have passed without administering
a quiet, but severe and well-merited rebuke.
   <a class="l" title="woman of ordinary intellect" href="#Tribune-1841-07-20-Dr-Marvin">Dr. Marvin, her family physician, testified</a> that “she was a
woman of <u>weak intellect, silly</u>, and easily influenced.” This
being so, it was not to be wondered at that such a woman, in
the hands of her notoriously abandoned and desperate husband,
should have been prevailed upon to testify in a manner which
would have subjected her to the penalties of the law. I wish
the public to bear in mind that this W. W. Purdy, her husband,
testified under oath that he never made overtures to me, either
personally or otherwise, to compromise; when a gentleman,
then one of the Grand Jurors, came forward and testified as
follows:—
   “<a class="l" href="#Tribune-1841-07-21">Huron Betts sworn for the defence</a>, deposed that he knew
W. W. Purdy—that he requested witness two or three weeks
ago to go to Madame Restell and ask her if she would give him
so much money to keep his witnesses away from the Court.—
He did not name any particular sum. Witness went with Purdy
from the Bowery down Chatham street, from Chatham street to
Broadway, and from Broadway down Cedar to the corner of
Cedar and Greenwich streets, where Purdy left witness, pro-
mising to meet him at a barber's shop at or near the corner of
Courtlandt street. Witness went into the house of Madame
Restell and saw a woman.”
	...
   It will be perceived that every one of the exceptions taken by
Mr. Jordan, on account of illegality, are sustained by the Su-
preme Court. A sufficient commentary upon that gentleman's
legal acquirements, to whom I return my sincere thanks for the
faithful, able and fearless manner in which he conducted him-
self throughout, regardless alike of the frowns and caresses of
all.		MADAME RESTELL, Female Physician,

   <b>Madame Restell—Virtue and Morality.</b>
   The other day, the newspaper press of this city
with one or two exceptions, was characterised by
the immortal Mike Walsh in the following lan-
guage:—“I know that there isn't a more pitiful,
contemptible, degraded, corrupt, lying, stinking set
of scoundrels than those that are connected with the
public press.” When that sentence was uttered, we
did not know that we should so soon afterwards
have such a striking specimen of its accuracy.
   It is well known, that for some time past, certain
papers laying claim to a large share of morality, if
not all of it in the city, raised a tremendous clamor
against Madame Restell for what they termed her
immoral practices. Yet we have since seen, and,
within a few days, in the “Tribune,” the “Sun”
and other moral papers, the whole of her case stated
as by herself and an elaborate defence of her; the
whole of which we give to-day as a specimen of the
honesty, morality and consistency of these pious
papers.
   This woman, it is very doubtful, has not been
guilty of any thing more in reality than is practised
by many medical men in this country. Yet these
papers have all come down upon her, open-mouth-
ed, ready to destroy her, and abused her in order, as
we now see, to levy black mail upon her in every
conceivable shape. One of the specimens of this
sort of conduct is that of Noah, (who in his little
paper is a sort of <u title="jackal">jackall</u> to Beach,) who lately open-
ed on her with the lowest species of abuse, in order
to compel her to walk up to the Captain's office and
settle. The effect of this abuse of Noah's was to
cause her immediately to go to his principal,
Beach, to get him to insert the defence, which we
have copied from the “Sun.” Beach very kindly
enters into the object of her visit, which he had been
expecting, and tells her that he will insert her de-
fence in his paper for $25, and caused it <i>to be in-
serted in the Union</i>, (<i>Noah's paper</i>) <i>for</i> $10 <i>more</i>.
   Hereafter, therefore, when any one shall see
themselves violently abused in Noah's little paper,
they will understand it as a hint to “step up to the
Captain's office and settle!”

   B<small>OZ ON</small> B<small>ROTHER</small> J<small>ONATHAN</small>.—Boz's work on the
United States will, no doubt, be sharp and caustic.
He and his <i>clique</i> of <i>literateurs</i> are preparing the way
for its reception. The following is an extract of a
letter from a friend of Dickens to one in this
country:—
<m9>   “The Dickens are down on the Kentish coast, and I am
daily expecting to hear of his projects, both literary and
locomotive, for the autumn. I rather think he will not
publish any thing directly about your country; but if he
does, I am sure you will be more irritable and thin-skinned
than becomes your actual and growing greatness, if you
take serious offence at any of the pleasantries with which
so perfectly candid and kind-hearted a man can possibly
visit any of your infirmities. It is too childish to suppose,
either that your are without them, or that they are not to
be laughed at, as well as the <i>ridicules</i> of other nations;
and surely D. has not spared either these, or the <i>vices</i> of
his own countrymen. At all events, as it is, and always
must be, apparent that he has no malice in his heart, you
will only put yourselves egregiously in the wrong, if you
take amiss any playful liberties he may take with your pe-
culiarities, and make indifferent people laugh longer and
louder at you. I know that he was delighted (as he well
might be) with his reception, and has a deep and grateful
sense of the kindness he everywhere met with.”</m9>
   If Dickens cuts up his toadies and <u title="committeemen">committe men</u>,
we have no objection; otherwise—otherwise.

<d>[Col.5]</d>
<m9>   S<small>ODOMY</small>.—A beast in the outward shape of a man, named
James Greigg, was arrested yesterday morning, on the
complaint of one of the most disgusting looking brutes
that ever graced the watch-house, for an attempt to com-
mit this crime. They were both exhibited in the Police
office during the day, and then discharged.
	...
   C<small>OURT OF</small> S<small>ESSIONS</small>.—Assistant Alderman S<small>COLES</small> called
up the resolution which had passed the other board regu-
lating the time for holding courts, and also abolishing
the pay of Aldermen sitting there as judges.
   Assistant Alderman W<small>ATERMAN</small> spoke in favor of the
Aldermen being continued as judges. He thought the
gentlemen taken from among the body of the people are
better qualified to pass upon the subjects presented there
than those not practically acquainted with the minutia
of daily events. The Aldermen had enjoyed the right for
a century, the members of the Supreme Court are divided
in opinion as to the constitutionality of the law tearing it
away from them—and the law will, in all probability,
soon be repealed by the Legislature. He moved that the
report lay on the table, to await the decision of the courts.
   Assistant Alderman S<small>COLES</small> replied. He said that the
Supreme Court had decided that the law is constitutional.
It is useless to be paying gentlemen four dollars a day for
what they have no legal right to receive. How much
benefit the Aldermen are in the Sessions can be seen by
any one visiting the court. We have to pay the Judges,
and it is hard that the city should also be burdened with
the pay of Aldermen claiming to sit as such.
   Assistant Alderman W<small>ATERMAN</small> rejoined. He read the
opinion of Justice Bronson, opposed to the idea of con-
stitutionality and made further remarks.
   Assistant Alderman S<small>COLES</small> alluded to the opinion of the
majority of the Court in favor. He thought this board
had nothing to do, however, with ulterior matters. It is
now the law, and should be obeyed by the Common Coun-
cil.
   Assistant Alderman W. D<small>ODGE</small> supported Mr. Scoles.
He read the opinion of Justice Cowen in favor of the con-
stitutionality of the law, which was approved of by Chief
Justice Nelson. He thought the acts of the Supreme
Court should be looked upon as the acts of a superior
being, until reversed by a higher Court. In paying the
Aldermen, we are supporting them in rebellion against
the laws of the State.

			——————
	<b>COURT OF OYER AND TERMINER.</b>
   For a considerable time before the opening of the Court,
the lobby was filled by a dense crowd, anxious to hear
the dreadful sentence of the law pronounced on the ill-
fated Colt. When the door was opened the crowd, as
usual, rushed in, in a rather <u title="tumultuous">tumultous</u> manner, and in a
few minutes afterwards the Court room was filled.
   About ten minutes past ten o'clock, the prisoner was
led into the court room by officers Colvin and Smith.
The unhappy man looked much worn, although not so
much so as might be expected. His countenance, how-
ever, was very pallid, his step had lost its firm,
elastic tread, and he hurriedly, and with a somewhat
faltering gait, walked towards the usual seat
taken by convicts on receiving their sentence. He
glanced round the room, and then immediately sat
down with his back towards the spectators. After
conversing, in an apparently cheerful manner, for a few
moments, with a young member of the bar named Field,
Colt asked for a morning paper, which was handed to him
by officer Smith, and he occupied himself in reading it,
and conversing with Mr. Morrill, one of his counsel, and
his brother Charles, until Judge Kent, and Aldermen Pur-
dy and Lee, the other members of the Court, (who presi-
ded at the trial) made their appearance.
   At half past ten Judge Kent and the Aldermen entered
the Court.
   Judge Kent had a few words of private conversation
with Mr. Whiting, the District Attorney, and Messrs. Gra-
ham and Morrill, the counsel for the prisoner Colt.
<l9>   Judge K<small>ENT</small>—Place John C. Colt at the bar.
   Colt was then placed at the bar.
   Mr. W<small>HITING</small> read a certified copy of the decision of the
Supreme Court, approving of the finding of this Court.
   Mr. S<small>ELDEN</small> said he had not before seen that document.
   Mr. W<small>HITING</small>—You were served with a copy.
   Mr. S<small>ELDEN</small>—It was that the exceptions be overruled.
The expression there is that a new trial be denied. The
Supreme Court had stated that upon a previous decision
made upon a case coming from the county of Madison, it
was decided that they had not the power of reviewing de-
cisions of the court on the interlocutory question. I sup-
pose from my communication with counsel who argued
that motion, that at the time it was under discussion, it
was a question capable of review.
   Judge K<small>ENT</small>.—What motion do you offer?
   Mr. S<small>ELDEN</small>.—I would be happy to be permitted to ar-
gue that point to which I allude. I am satisfied that the
ruling of this <u title="court">count</u> is not in conformity with the opinion
of the Bar or of the judges.
   Judge K<small>ENT</small>—We cannot give you the permission you
seek.
   S<small>ELDEN</small>—Courts have sometimes consented to have a
question reviewed.
   Judge K<small>ENT</small>—Any thing farther Mr. Selden?
   S<small>ELDEN</small>—Nothing, Sir.
   The Clerk of the Court then desired Colt to stand up,
and addressed him in the usual form—
   “You may remember you have heretofore been indicted
for a murder, on that indictment you were arraigned,
you pleaded not guilty and put yourself on the benefit
of a trial, you were found guilty,—what have you now to
say why judgment should not be pronounced against
you?”
   The P<small>RISONER</small>.—I have prepared a few remarks which I
wish to go to the court.
   Judge K<small>ENT</small>.—Do you wish it read aloud?
   C<small>OLT</small>.—Certainly, sir.
   Judge K<small>ENT</small> then read the following paper handed to
him from the prisoner at the bar.—
   “The position I now hold is to a sentient being the most
agonising possible. It is more painful than the struggle
of death itself. But it is a form of procedure that I am
obliged to pass through before my case reaches the last
tribunal of the State to which it will be carried in accord-
ance with the justice which cannot be denied to the mean-
est of mankind. Most cheerfully will I submit my case
to final examination by the Court of Errors. I fully be-
lieve it will set aside the judgement of the Jury, who were
so far led aside by prejudice and error as to trample on the
evidence—to trample on the law—to trample on the
Judge's charge. Amid the thousand false rumors in cir-
culation at the time of, and before my trial, it may not,
however, be considered surprising that the Jury were
misled from coming to a right conclusion. For it is a
truth, that no man can question, that the most reputable
characters have often been prejudiced, even without
themselves being aware of the fact. How far these pre-
judices affected the Jury, may be inferred from the
<u title="fact">act</u> that one of them, Mr. Husted, remarked before the tri-
al, that “Colt should be hung first and tried afterwards,”
which will be proved by the affidavits of several respecta-
ble witnesses. All that, unfortunately situated as I am, I can
expect is an impartial trial by jury. This is all I desire,
and this the meanest vagrant in the streets has a right to
demand. Misfortune, not crime, has placed me in this po-
sition, and although as low down as possible without be-
ing annihilated, still, rest assured I have not so lost my
self-respect, nor regard for the credit of the species, as to
submit calmly to this injustice. As this consequently is
not to be the end of this business, I desire that the Court
will spare me the pain of all unnecessary powers of sen-
tence, especially the accompanying comments.”
   Judge K<small>ENT</small>—The Court has no desire, I can assure you
to make unnecessary comments. The scene is as painful
to the Court as it can be distressing to you. I only now
refuse to accede to your request by making a few remarks
on the conduct of the Jury. It is due to justice, and it is
due to one of the most intelligent Juries that ever sat in a
Court of Justice, that I should not allow them, in this
their appropriate tribunal, to be traduced (for I must use
that expression), without entering my solemn protest
against it. That Jury was selected out of three hundred
of our most respectable citizens, taken indiscriminately from
the city, selected under a most vigorous exercise of the <u title="peremptory">pe-
remtory</u> challenge by the prisoner; and in <u title="every (Herald-1842-09-28), any (Tribune)">my</u> case when
objections were raised and allowed it was in favor of the
prisoner. Thus selected, their demeanor in court
was such as to entitle them to the highest
consideration of the tribunal in which they ap-
peared. Cut off from intercourse with their fami-
lies, <u title="separated">separrted</u> from their business and the world—enclo-
sed here in a sort of prison for eleven days—I never <u title="saw">seen</u>
one of them exhibit the slightest impatience, on the con-
trary they <u>bore bore</u> with most exemplary patience and
dignity even unnecessary delays in the progress of the
trial; calmly, honestly, unfalteringly, earnest only to dis-
cover the truth from the appalling evidence spread before
them. Had these men been followed to <u title="their (Tribune)">the</u> room, we
<u>would</u> have seen the same quiet, calm, impassive,
honest inquiry attending and characterizing their de-
liberations. In so far, therefore, as this paper expresses
dissatisfaction with, and contempt of the Court and Jury,
it is the conscientious opinion of him who now addresses
you, that it is entirely incorrect and unsupported. If that
Court erred at all I believe it did in too lenient a con-
struction of the circumstances of your offence, and happy
will it be for innocence in all future time to be brought
before a tribunal as willing to hear, as ready to
believe, as humane to forgive. I do not wish to prolong
this distressing scene. You are a man of <u title="education">educatien</u>—a
man of talent. We have had the most striking and im-
pressive evidence that you can calmly contemplate and
coolly meet the most alarming crisis in human life. I will
not therefore address to you any of the common-place—
ordinary topics addressed to criminals on the approach of
death. I leave that to your reflections, simply adding,
that so far as the Court is concerned, they are now about to
appoint the ultimate hour of your existence; and I trust
you will meet that hour, relying not on human means
and that when earth is disappearing from your view, not
on earthly things will your thoughts be placed. It is my
duty to say in addition that it appears to me that you
evince the most total insensibility regarding the crime,
whose commission has brought you to that bar. For be
it remembered, that though lawyers and juries debated
what degree of offence it came to—whether it were tech-
nical murder, or technical manslaughter, no man ever
doubted that it was a crime of the greatest <u title="magnitude">mag-
nitue</u> and enormity, and which has left the stain
of blood-guiltiness on your soul! It is a crime, too,
<u title="whose commission (Tribune)">which</u> has sunk deep in the community. Leaving out
of view all those appalling circumstances which followed
the commission of that homicide, which I will not distress
you nor myself by summing up now—leaving out of view
all but those gaping wounds themselves, no doubt can ex-
ist that the deed was marked by ferocious passion and
sanguinary cruelty.
   C<small>OLT</small> here rose and made an effort to speak. Judge
Kent paused, and the prisoner proceeded in a loud voice
and hurried manner—“I wanted not to convey the idea
that the Jury acted wilfully wrong, but that they were
misled. The Judge's charge is the best argument to prove
that. I do not impugn the motives of the Jury—I only
speak of them as having been in error, which is, I believe,
now the opinion of nine-tenths of the community. As
far as regards my own conscience in this affair, I assure
you, sir, that I would rather trust the whole affair to God
himself than to man. I never committed an act in my life
that I would not have done again under the same circum-
stances. Depend upon it, I am not the man who could
receive an insult without making some retaliation. The
retaliation was not made with any idea of killing the
man, but he made the assault and was responsible for con-
sequences. I think, sir, you have misapprehended en-
tirely the sentiment I meant to convey on that bit of
paper. I am ready for the sentence, as I know it cannot
be avoided.
   Judge K<small>ENT</small>.—The sentence will now be pronounced,
with an expression of the regret with which the Court
have marked such morbid insensibility which you exhi-
bit in your last speech, and which convinces me that any
further remarks would be lost. The sentence of the court
is that you, John C. Colt, on the 18th of Nov. next, be
hanged by the neck until you be dead, and may God have
mercy on your soul! Remove the prisoner.
   The prisoner was then removed and left the court appa-
rently without the least emotion.</l9>

	<b>Sentence of Wiley and Colt.</b>
   In the Court of Oyer and Terminer yesterday
morning considerable interest was excited by the
fact the sentence of the law was to be pronounced
upon W<small>ILLIAM</small> W<small>ILEY</small>, convicted of having re-
ceived $120,000 stolen from Maryland Bank, and
J<small>OHN</small> C. C<small>OLT</small>, convicted of the murder of Samuel
Adams.
   In passing sentence upon Wiley, Judge K<small>ENT</small>
remarked that his original intention of pronouncing
the severest sentence the law would allow had
been changed by the recommendation by the jury
of the prisoner to mercy, by the consideration that
the offender had already suffered much in the
depth of infamy to which his crime had sunk him,
and that his crime was the first of the kind ever
presented in the State. He then sentenced him to
imprisonment in the County Jail for six months,
and to pay a fine of $250. Mr. Blunt stated that
he had an order from Judge Cowen, of the Su-
preme Court, to stay execution of the sentence as
the case would be carried up.
   C<small>OLT</small> was then placed at the bar. Mr. S<small>ELDEN</small>,
Counsel for the prisoner, asked leave to argue a
technicality in the decision of the Supreme Court,
but it was refused. C<small>OLT</small> then rose to receive his
sentence. He was neatly dressed in black, and
though somewhat thinner and more pale his ap-
pearance had not greatly changed since his trial.
He exhibited the same cool indifference and in
reply to the formal question, “what have you to
say why judgement should not be pronounced
against you?” handed to the Court the following
paper which was read by Judge Kent:
<m9>   “The position I now hold is to a sentient being the most
agonising possible. It is more painful than the struggle of
death itself. But it is a form of procedure that I am
obliged to pass through before my case reaches the last tri-
bunal of the State to which it will be carried in accordance
with that justice which cannot be denied to the meanest of
mankind. Most cheerfully will I submit my case to final
examination by the Court of Errors. I fully believe it will
set aside the judgement of the Jury, who were so<u title=" far (in Herald)"> </u>led aside
by prejudice and error as to trample on the evidence—to
trample on the law—to trample on the Judge's charge.—
Amid the thousand false rumors in circulation at the time
of, and before my trial, it may not, however, be considered
surprising that the Jury were misled from coming to a right
conclusion. For it is a truth, that no man can question,
that the most reputable characters have often been pre-
judiced, even without themselves being aware of the fact.
How far these prejudices affected the Jury, may be in-
ferred from the fact that one of them, Mr. Husted, remarked
before the trial, that “Colt should be hung first and tried
afterward,” which will be proved by the affidavits of sev-
eral respectable witnesses. All that, unfortunately situated
as I am, I can expect is an impartial trial by Jury. This is
all I desire, and this the meanest vagrant in the streets has

   Judge K<small>ENT</small> said that the Court had no desire to make
unnecessary comments. The scene, said he, is as painful to
the Court as it can be distressing to you. I only now refuse
to accede to your request for the purpose of making a

intercourse with their families, separated from their business
and the world, enclosed here in a sort of prison for eleven
days, I never saw one of them exhibit the slightest impa-

patience and dignity even unnecessary delays in the pro-
gress of the trial; calmly, honestly, unfalteringly—earnest
only to discover the truth from the appalling evidence
spread before them. Had these men been followed to <u>their</u>

   Colt here manifested a wish to speak, and
Judge K. paused. In a loud voice and with a
greatly excited tone the prisoner said—

   The prisoner was then removed<u title="and left the court apparently without the least emotion (Herald)">, having exhibi-

   The trial of Edwards was set down for the 4th
Monday of the term (Oct. 17.)

   <i>Ladies' Companion</i>.—We believe the November No.
which came out this morning, as it always does on
the first day of the month, is fully equal to its well es-
tablished reputation. Mrs. Embury, always our fa-

fully told tale of the Olden Time. Willis contributes
a characteristic, and therefore a spirited sketch which

told is <i>coincidental</i> with the case of the murder of

We can tell rather, better as to the coincidence, when
the story is completed. It is, however, of itself ro-

<i><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=X6o7AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA471">Es giebt eine Reihe idealischer Begebenheiten</a>, die
   der Wirklichkeit parallel lauft<u>,</u> Selten fallen sie
   <u title="zusammen">Zusammen</u>. Menschen und <u title="Zufalle">zufalle</u> <u>modificiren</u>
   gewohnlich die idealische Begebenheit, so dass sie

There are ideal series of events which run parallel
   with the real ones. They rarely coincide. Men and
   circumstances generally modify the ideal train of
   events, so that it seems imperfect, and its consequen-
   ces are equally imperfect. Thus with the Refor-
   mation; instead of Protestantism came Lutheran-
   ism.—Novalis. Moral Ansichten.</i>

   T<small>HERE</small> are few persons, even among the calmest
thinkers, who have not occasionally been startled into
a vague yet thrilling half-credence in the supernatural,
by <i>coincidences</i> of so seemingly marvellous a character
that, as <i>mere</i> coincidences, the intellect has been unable
to receive them. Such sentiments—for the half-creden-
ces of which I speak have never the full force of <i>thought</i>
—such sentiments are seldom thoroughly stifled unless
by reference to the doctrine of chance, or, as it is tech-
nically termed, the Calculus of Probabilities. Now
this Calculus is, in its essence, purely mathematical;
and thus we have the anomaly of the most rigidly exact
in science applied to the shadow and spirituality of the
most intangible in speculation.
   The extraordinary details which I am now called
upon to make public, will be found to form, as regards
sequence of time, the primary branch of a series of
scarcely intelligible <i>coincidences</i>, whose secondary or
concluding branch will be recognized by all readers in
the late murder of M<small>ARY</small> C<small>ECILIA</small> R<small>OGERS</small>, at New
York.
   When, in an article, entitled “The Murders in the
Rue Morgue,” I endeavored, about a year ago, to de-
pict some very remarkable features in the mental cha-
racter of my friend, the Chevalier C. Auguste Dupin,
it did not occur to me that I should ever resume the
subject. This depicting of character constituted my
design; and this design was thoroughly fulfilled in the
wild train of circumstances brought to instance Dupin's
idiosyncrasy. I might have adduced other examples,
but it should have proven no more. Late events, how-
ever, in their surprising development, have startled me
into some farther details, which will carry with them
the air of extorted confession. Hearing what I have
lately heard, it would be indeed strange should I remain
longer silent in regard to what I both heard and saw so
long ago.
   Upon the winding up of the tragedy involved in the
<d>[Col.2]</d>
deaths of Madame L'Espanaye and her daughter, the
Chevalier dismissed the affair at once from his atten-
tion, and relapsed into his old habits of moody and fan-
tastic reverie. Prone, at all times, to abstraction, I
readily fell in with his humor; and, continuing to
occupy our chamber in the Faubourg Saint Germain,
we gave the Future to the winds, and slumbered tran-
quilly in the Present, weaving the dull world around us
into dreams.
   But these dreams were not altogether uninterrupted.
It may readily be supposed that the part played by my
friend, in the drama, at the Rue Morgue, had not failed
of its impression upon the fancies of the Parisian police.
With its emissaries, the name of Dupin had grown into
a household word. The simple character of those
inductions by which he had disentangled the mystery
never having been explained even to the Prefect, or to
any other individual than myself, of course it is not sur-
prizing that the affair was regarded little less than
miraculous, or that the Chevalier's analytical abilities
acquired for him the credit of intuition. His frankness
would have led him to disabuse every inquirer of such
prejudice; but his indolent humor forbade all farther
agitation on a topic whose interest to himself had long
ceased. It thus happened that he found himself the
cynosure of the policial eyes; and the cases were not
few in which attempt was made to engage his services
at the Prefecture. The only instance, nevertheless, in
which such attempt proved successful, was the instance
to which I have already alluded—that of the murder of
a young girl named Marie Rogêt.
   This event occurred about two years after the atro-
city in the Rue Morgue. Marie, whose Christian and
family name will at once arrest attention from their
resemblance to those of the unfortunate “segar-girl,”
was the only daughter of the widow Estelle Rogêt.
The father had died during the child's infancy, and
from the period of his death, until within eighteen
months before the assassination which forms the sub-
ject of our narrative, the mother and daughter had
dwelt together in the Rue Pavée Saint Andrée;
<a class="l" href="#Sun-1841-06-29">Madame there keeping a <i>pension</i></a>, assisted by Marie.
Affairs went on thus until the latter had attained her
twenty-second year, when her great beauty attracted
the notice of a perfumer, who occupied one of the shops
in the basement of the Palais Royal, and whose custom
lay chiefly among the desperate adventurers infesting
that neighborhood. Monsieur Le Blanc was not una-
ware of the advantages to be derived from the attend-
ance of the fair Marie in his <i>parfumerie;</i> and his libe-
ral proposals were accepted eagerly by the girl, but
with somewhat more hesitation by Madame.
   The anticipations of the shopkeeper were realized,
and his rooms soon became notorious through the
charms of the sprightly <i>grisette</i>. She had been in his
employ about a year, when her admirers were thrown
into <a class="l" href="#Farmer-1841-08-17-Marys-disappearance">confusion</a> <a class="l" href="#Herald-1841-08-03">by her sudden disappearance</a> <a class="l" href="#American-Masonic-Register-1841-08-07">from</a> <a class="l" href="#Sunbury-American-1841-09-04">the
shop.</a> Monsieur Le Blanc was unable to account for
her absence, and Madame Rogêt was distracted with
anxiety and terror. The public papers immediately
<d>[<a class="e" id="Ladies-Companion-1842-11-p16" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=uE1FAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA16">Col.1</a>]</d>
took up the theme, and the police were upon the point
of making serious investigations, when, one fine morn-
ing, after the lapse of a week, Marie, in good health,
but with a somewhat saddened air, made her re-ap-
pearance at her usual counter in the <i>parfumerie</i>. All
inquiry, except that of a private character, was of
course immediately hushed. Monsieur Le Blanc pro-
fessed total ignorance, as before. Marie, with Madame,
replied to all questions, that the last week had been
spent at the house of a relation in the country. Thus
the affair died away, and was generally forgotten; for
the girl, ostensibly to relieve herself from the imperti-
nence of curiosity, soon bade a final adieu to the perfu-
mer, and sought the shelter of her mother's residence
in the Rue Pavée Saint Andrée.
   It was about five months after this return home, that
her friends were alarmed by her sudden disappearance
for the second time. Three days elapsed, and nothing
was heard of her. On the fourth <a class="l" href="#American-1841-07-30">her corpse was found</a>
floating in the Seine, near the shore which is opposite
the Quartier of the Rue Saint Andrée, and at a point
not very far distant from the secluded neighborhood of
the Barrière du Roule.
   The atrocity of this murder, (for it was at once evi-
dent that murder had been committed,) the youth and
beauty of the victim, and, above all, her previous noto-
riety, conspired to produce intense excitement in the
minds of the sensitive Parisians. I can call to mind no
similar occurrence producing so general and so intense
an effect. For several weeks, in the discussing of this
one absorbing theme, even the momentous political
topics of the day were forgotten. The Prefect made
unusual exertions; and the powers of the whole Pari-
sian police were, of course, tasked to the utmost extent.
   Upon the first discovery of the corpse, it was not sup-
posed that the murderer would be able to elude, for
more than a very brief period, the inquisition which
was immediately set on foot. It was not until the
<a class="l" href="#Courier-1841-08-02-will-offer-a-reward">expiration of a week</a> <a class="l" href="#Tribune-1841-09-07">that it was</a> <a class="l" href="#Herald-1841-09-07-Col6">deemed necessary</a> to
offer a reward; and even then this reward was limited
to a thousand francs. In the mean time the investi-
gation proceeded with vigor, if not always with judg-
ment, and <a class="l" href="#Courier-1841-08-05">numerous individuals</a> <a class="l" href="#Courier-1841-08-06">were examined</a> to no
purpose; while, owing to the continual absence of all
clue to the mystery, the popular <a class="l" href="#Courier-1841-08-03">excitement became
greatly increased. At the end of the tenth day</a> it was
thought advisable to double the sum originally pro-
posed; and, at length, the second week having elapsed
without leading to any discoveries, and the <a class="l" href="#Corrector-1841-08-11-Friend-to-reform">prejudice</a>
which always exists in Paris against the police having
given vent to itself in several serious <i>émeutes</i>, the Pre-
fect took it upon himself to offer the sum of twenty
thousand francs “for the conviction of the assassin,” or,
if more than one should prove to have been implicated,
for the conviction of any one of the assassins.” In the
<a class="l" href="#Evening-Post-1841-09-02-Col5">proclamation</a> setting forth this reward, a full <a class="l" href="#American-1841-08-10">pardon</a>
was promised to any accomplice who should come for-
ward in evidence against his fellow; and to the whole
was appended, wherever it appeared, the private pla-
card of a <a class="l" href="#Herald-1841-08-12-PM">committee of citizens</a>, <a class="l" href="#Evening-Post-1841-08-12">offering</a> <a class="l" href="#Herald-1841-08-13-2">ten thousand</a>
francs, in addition to the amount proposed by the Pre-
<d>[Col.2]</d>
fecture. The entire reward thus stood at no less than
thirty thousand francs, which will be regarded as an
extraordinary sum when we consider the humble con-
dition of the girl, and the great frequency in large cities,
of such atrocities as the one described.
   No one doubted now that the mystery of this murder
would be immediately brought to light. But although,
in one or two instances, arrests were made which pro-
mised elucidation, yet nothing was elicited which could
implicate the parties suspected, and they were dis-
charged forthwith. Strange as it may appear, the
third week from the discovery of the body had passed,
and passed without any light being thrown upon the
subject, before even a rumor of the events which had so
agitated the public mind, reached the ears of Dupin
and myself. Engaged in researches which had ab-
sorbed our whole attention, it had been nearly a month
since either of us had gone abroad, or received a visitor,
or more than glanced at the leading political articles in
one of the daily papers. The first intelligence of the
murder was brought us by G——, in person. He
called upon us early in the afternoon of the thirteenth
of July, 18—, and remained with us until late in the
night. He had been piqued by the failure of all his
endeavors to ferret out the assassins. His reputation
—so he said with a peculiarly Parisian air—was at
stake. Even his honor was concerned. The eyes of
the public were upon him; and there was really no
sacrifice which he would not be willing to make for the
development of the mystery. He concluded a some-
what droll speech with a compliment upon which he
was pleased to term the <i>tact</i> of Dupin, and made him a
direct, and certainly a liberal proposition, the precise
nature of which I do not feel myself at liberty to dis-
close, but which has no bearing upon the proper subject
of my narrative.
   The compliment my friend rebutted as best he could,
but the proposition he accepted at once, although its
advantages were altogether provisional. This point
being settled, the Prefect broke forth at once into
explanations of his own views, interspersing them with
long comments upon the evidence; of which latter we
were not yet in possession. He discoursed much, and
beyond doubt, learnedly; while I hazarded an occa-
sional suggestion as the night wore drowsily away.
Dupin, sitting steadily in his accustomed arm-chair,
was the embodiment of respectful attention. He wore
spectacles, during the whole interview; and an occa-
sional glance beneath their green glasses, sufficed to
convince me that he slept not the less soundly, because
silently throughout the seven or eight leaden-footed
hours which immediately preceded the departure of the
Prefect.
   In the morning, I procured, at the Prefecture, a full
report of all the evidence elicited, and, at the various
newspaper offices, a copy of every paper in which, from
first to last, had been published any decisive infor-
mation in regard to this sad affair. Freed from all
that was positively disproved, this mass of information
stood thus:
   Marie Rogêt left the residence of her mother, in the
<d>[<a class="e" id="Ladies-Companion-1842-11-p17" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=uE1FAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA17">Col.1</a>]</d>
Rue Pavée Saint Andrée, about nine o'clock in the morn-
ing of Sunday, June the twenty-second, 18—. In going
out, <a class="l" href="#Tribune-1841-08-12">she gave notice</a> <a class="l" href="#Herald-1841-08-12-Daniel-Payne">to a Monsieur Jacques Eustache</a>,
and to him only, on her intention to spend the day with
an aunt who resided in the Rue des Drômes. The
Rue des Drômes is a short and narrow but populous
thoroughfare, not far from the banks of the river, and at
a distance of some two miles, in the most direct course
possible, from the <i>pension</i> of Madame Rogêt. St.
Eustache was the accepted suitor of Marie, and lodged,
as well as took his meals, at the <i>pension</i>. He was to
have gone for his betrothed at dusk, and to have
escorted her home. In the afternoon, however, it came
on to rain heavily; and, supposing that she would
remain all night at her aunt's, (as she had done under
similar circumstances before,) he did not think it
necessary to keep his promise. As night drew on,
Madame Rogêt (who was an <a class="l" href="#Tribune-1841-08-19">infirm old lady, seventy
years of age</a>,) was heard to <a class="l" title="mother was very much alarmed about her" href="#Evening-Post-1841-08-12-Alarmed-mother">express</a> <a class="l" title="Mrs. R. was very uneasy" href="#Courier-1841-08-12-Daniel-Payne">a fear</a> “that she
should <a class="l" href="#Evening-Post-1841-08-16">never see Marie</a> <a class="l" href="#Herald-1841-08-25">again</a>;” but this observation
attracted little attention at the time.
   On Monday, it was ascertained that the girl had not
been to the Rue des Drômes; and when the day elapsed
without tidings of her, a tardy search was instituted at
several points in the city, and its environs. It was not,
however, until the fourth day from the period of her
disappearance that any thing satisfactory was ascer-
tained respecting her. On this day, (Wednesday, the
twenty-fifth of June,) A Monsieur Beauvais, who with
a friend, had been making inquiries for Marie near the
Barrière du Roule, on the shore of the Seine, which is
opposite the Rue Pavée Saint Andrée, was informed that
a corpse had just been towed ashore by some fishermen,
who had found it floating in the river. Upon seeing the
body, <a class="l" title="recognized the body to be that of Miss Mary" href="#Courier-1841-08-13-Alfred-Crommelin">Beauvais, after some hesitation, identified it as
that of the perfumery girl</a>. His friend recognized it
more promptly.
   <a class="l" title="Her face was swollen" href="#Herald-1841-08-17-2-Dr-Cook">The face was suffused with dark blood</a>, some of which
issued from the mouth. No foam was seen, as in the
case of the merely drowned. There was no discolora-
tion in the cellular tissue. About the throat were
bruises and impressions of fingers. The arms were
bent over on the chest and were rigid. The right hand
was clenched; the left partially open. On the left
wrist were two circular excoriations, apparently the
effect of ropes, or of a rope in more than one volution.
A part of the right wrist, also, was much chafed, as well
as the back throughout its extent, but more especially at
the shoulder-blades. In bringing the body to the shore the
fishermen had attached to it a rope; but none of the
excoriations had been effected by this. The flesh of
the neck was much swollen. There were no cuts
apparent, or bruises which appeared the effect of blows.
A piece of lace was found tied so tightly around the neck
as to be hidden from sight; it was completely buried
in the flesh, and was fastened by a knot which lay just
under the left ear. This alone would have sufficed to
produce death. The medical testimony spoke confi-
dently of the virtuous character of the deceased. She
had been subjected to brutal violence. The corpse was
in such condition when found, that there could have
been no difficulty in its recognition by friends.
<d>[Col.2]</d>
   The dress was much torn and otherwise disordered.
In the outer garment, a slip, about a foot wide, had
been torn upward from the bottom hem to the waist,
but not torn off. It was wound three times around the
waist, and secured by a sort of hitch in the back. The
dress immediately beneath the frock was of fine muslin;
and from this a slip eighteen inches wide had been torn
entirely out—torn very evenly and with great care. It
was found around her neck, fitting loosely, and secured
with a hard knot. Over this muslin slip and the slip of
lace, the strings of a bonnet were attached; the bonnet
being appended. The knot by which the strings of the
bonnet were fastened, was not a lady's, but a slip or
sailor's knot.
   After the recognition of the corpse, it was not, as
usual, taken to the Morgue, (this formality being
superfluous,) but hastily interred not far for the spot
at which it was brought ashore. Through the exertions
of Beauvais, the matter was industriously hushed up, as
far as possible; and several days had elapsed before
any public emotion resulted. A weekly paper, how-
ever, at length took up the theme; the corpse was
disinterred, and a re-examination instituted; and noth-
ing was elicited beyond what has been already noted.
The clothes, however, were now submitted to the
<a class="l" href="#Courier-1841-08-13-Mother">mother and friends</a> of the deceased, and <a class="l" href="#Evening-Post-1841-08-13-Mrs-Rogers">fully identified</a>
as those worn by the girl upon leaving home.
   Meantime, the excitement increased hourly. Several
individuals were arrested and discharged. St. Eus-
tache fell especially under suspicion; and he failed at
first, to give an intelligible account of his whereabouts
during the Sunday on which Marie left home. Subse-
quently, however, he submitted to Monsieur G——,
<a class="l" href="#Herald-1841-08-18-Daniel-Payne-on-fatal-Sunday">affidavits, accounting satisfactorily for every hour</a> of the
day in question. As time passed and no discovery
ensued, a thousand contradictory rumors were circu-
lated, and journalists busied themselves in <i>suggestions</i>.
Among these, the one which attracted the most notice,
was the idea that Marie Rogêt still lived—that the
corpse found in the Seine was that of some other
unfortunate. It will be proper that I submit to the
reader some passages which embody the suggestion
alluded to. These passages are <i>literal</i> translations
from “L'Etoile,” a small daily print conducted, in
general, with much ability.
<m9>   “Mademoiselle Rogêt left her mother's house on Sunday
morning, June the twenty-second, 18—, with the ostensible
purpose of going to see her aunt, or some other connexion, in
the Rue des Drômes. From that hour, nobody is proved to
have seen her. There is no trace or tidings of her at all. * *
* * There has no person, whatever, come forward, so far,
who saw her at all, on that day, after she left her mother's
door. * * * * Now, though we have no evidence that
Marie Rogêt was in the land of the living after nine o'clock on
Sunday, June the twenty-second, we have proof that, up to that
hour, she was alive. On Wednesday noon, at twelve, a female
body was discovered afloat on the shore of the Barrière du
Roule. This was, even if we presume that Marie Rogêt was
thrown into the river within three hours after she left her
mother's house, only three days from the time she left her
home—three days to an hour. But it is folly to suppose that
the murder, if murder was committed on her body, could have
been consummated soon enough to have enabled her murderers
to throw the body into the river before midnight. Those who
are guilty of such horrid crimes, choose darkness rather than
light. * * * * Thus we see that if the body found in the
river <i>was</i> that of Marie Rogêt, it could only have been in the
water two and a half days, or three at the outside. All expe-
rience has shown that drowned bodies, or bodies thrown into
the water immediately after death by violence, require from</m9>
<d>[<a class="e" id="Ladies-Companion-1842-11-p18" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=uE1FAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA18">Col.1</a>]</d>
<m9>six to ten days for sufficient decomposition to take place to
bring them to the top of the water. Even where a cannon is
fired over a corpse, and it rises before at least five or six days'
immersion, it sinks again, if let alone. Now, we ask, what was
there in this case to cause a departure from the ordinary course
of nature? * * * * If the body had been kept in its man-
gled state on shore until Tuesday night, some trace would be
found on shore of the murderers. It is a doubtful point, also,
whether the body would be so soon afloat, even were it thrown
in after having been dead two days. And, furthermore, it is
exceedingly improbable that any villains who had committed
such a murder as is here supposed, would have thrown the
body in without weight to sink it, when such a precaution
could have so easily been taken.”</m9>
   [The editor here proceeds to argue that the body
must have been in the water “not three days merely,
but, at least, <a title="Partly in The Liberator. September 3, 1841" href="http://www.newspapers.com/newspage/34600314">five times three days</a>,” because it was so
far decomposed that Beauvais had great difficulty in
recognizing it. This latter point, however, was fully
disproved. We continue our translation:]
<m9>   “What, then, are the facts on which M. Beauvais says that
he has no doubt the body was that of Marie Rogêt? He ripped
up the gown sleeve, and says he found marks which satisfied
him of the identity. The public generally supposed those
marks to have consisted of some description of scars. He
rubbed the arm and found <i>hair</i> upon it—something as indefinite,
we think, as can readily be imagined—as little conclusive as
finding an arm in the sleeve. M. Beauvais did not return that
night, but sent word to Madame Rogêt, at seven o'clock, on
Wednesday evening, that an investigation was still in progress
respecting her daughter. If we allow that Madame Rogêt,
from her age and grief, could not go over, (which is allowing a
great deal,) there certainly must have been some one who
would have thought it worth while to go over and attend the
investigation, if they thought the body was that of Marie.
Nobody went over. There was nothing said or heard about
the matter in Rue Pavée St. Andrée, that reached even the
occupants of the same building. M. St. Eustache, the lover
and intended husband, of Marie, who boarded in her mother's
house, deposes that he did not hear of discovery of the
body of his intended until the next morning, when M. Beauvais
came into his chamber and told him of it. For an item of news
like this, it strikes us it was very coolly received.”</m9>
   [In this way the journal endeavored to create the
impression of an apathy on the part of the relatives of
Marie, inconsistent with the supposition that these rela-
tives believed the corpse to be her's. Its insinuations
amount to this:—that Marie, with the connivance of
her friends, had absented herself from the city for
reasons involving a charge against her chastity; and
that these friends, upon the discovery of a corpse in the
Seine, somewhat resembling that of the girl, had availed
themselves of the opportunity to impress the public
with the belief of her death. But the “L'Etoile,” was
again over-hasty. It was distinctly proved that no
apathy, such as was imagined, existed; that the old
lady was <a class="l" href="#Herald-1841-08-25-Marys-mother">exceedingly feeble</a>, and so agitated as to be
unable to attend to any duty; that St. Eustache, so far
from receiving the news coolly, was distracted with
grief, and bore himself so frantically, that M. Beauvais
prevailed upon a friend and relative to take charge of
him, and prevent his attending the examination at the
disinterment. Moreover, although it was stated by
“L'Etoile,” that the corpse was re-interred at the
public expense,—that an advantageous offer of private
sepulture was absolutely declined by the family—and
that no member of the family attended the ceremonial:
—although, I say, all this was asserted by “L'Etoile,”
in furtherance of the impression it designed to convey—
yet <i>all</i> this was satisfactorily disproved. In a subse-
quent number of the paper, an attempt was made to
throw suspicion upon Beauvais himself. The editor
says:]
<d>[Col.2]</d>
<m9>   “Now, then, a change comes over the matter. We are told
that, on one occasion, while a Madame B——, was at Madame
Rogêt's house, M. Beauvais, who was going out, told her that
a <i>gendarme</i> was expected there, and that she, Madame B.,
must not say any thing to the <i>gendarme</i> until he returned, but
let the matter be for him. * * * * In the present posture
of affairs, M. Beauvais appears to have the whole matter locked
up in his head. A single step cannot be taken without M.
Beauvais; for, go which way you will, you run against him. * *
* * * For some reason, he determined that nobody shall
have any thing to do with the proceedings but himself, and he has
elbowed the male relatives out of the way, according to their
representations, in a very singular manner. He seems to have
been very much averse to permitting the relatives to see the
body.”</m9>
   [Some color was given to the suspicion thus thrown
upon Beauvais, by the following fact. A visitor at his
office, a few days prior to the girl's disappearance, and
during the absence of its occupant, had observed <a class="l" href="#Tribune-1841-08-13"><i>a rose</i></a>
in the key-hole of the door, and the <a class="l" href="#Sun-1841-08-13-Archibald-Padley">name “<i>Marie</i>,”</a>
inscribed upon a slate which hung near at hand.
   The general impression, so far as we were enabled to
glean it from the newspapers, seemed to be, that Marie
had been the victim of <i>a gang</i> of desperadoes—that by
these she had been borne across the river, maltreated
and murdered. “Le Commerciel,” however, a print of
extensive influence, was earnest in combatting this
popular idea. I quote a passage or two from its
columns:]
<m9>   “<a class="l" href="#Albany-Evening-Journal-1841-08-24">We are persuaded that pursuit</a> <a class="l" href="#Schenectady-Reflector-1841-08-27-false-scent">has hitherto been on a false
scent</a>, so far as it has been directed to the Barrière du Roule.
It is impossible that a person so well known to thousands as
this young woman was, should have passed three blocks without
some one having seen her; and any one who saw her would
have remembered it, for she interested all who knew her. It
was when the streets were full of people, <u title="that (elsewhere)">when</u> she went out.
* * * It is impossible that she should have gone to the
Barrière du Roule, or to the Rue des Drômes, without being
recognized by a dozen persons; yet no one has come forward
who saw her outside of her mother's door, and there is no evi-
dence, except the testimony concerning her <i>expressed <u title="intention (elsewhere)">inten-
tions</u></i>, that she did go out at all. Her gown was torn, bound
round her, and tied; and by that the body was carried as a
bundle. If the murder had been committed at the Barrière du
Roule, there would have been no necessity for any such arrange-
ment. The fact that the body was found floating near the
Barrière, is no proof as to where it was thrown into the water.
* * * * * A piece of one of the unfortunate girl's petti-
coats, two feet long and one foot wide, was torn out and tied
under her <u title="chin and around (elsewhere)">chin around</u> the back of her head, probably to pre-
vent<u title=" her (elsewhere)"> </u>screams. This was done by fellows who had no pocket-
<u title="handkerchiefs (elsewhere)">handkerchief</u>.”</m9>
   <a class="l" href="#Herald-1841-09-06">A day or two before</a> <a class="l" href="#Evening-Post-1841-09-06">the Prefect</a> called upon us, how-
ever, some important information reached the police,
which seemed to overthrow, at least, the chief portion
of Le Commerciel's argument. <a class="l" href="#Herald-1841-09-17-Col4">Two small boys, sons</a>
of a Madame Deluc, while roaming among <a class="l" href="#Sun-1841-08-26-Weehawken">the woods</a>
near the Barrière du Roule, chanced to penetrate a close
thicket, within which were three or four large stones,
forming a kind of seat, with a back and footstool. On
the upper stone lay a white petticoat; on the second a
silk scarf. <a class="l" href="#Evening-Post-1841-08-16-Marys-parasol">A parasol</a>, gloves, and a pocket-handkerchief
were also here found. The handkerchief bore the name
“Marie Rogêt.” Fragments of dress were discovered
on the brambles around. The earth was trampled, the
bushes were broken, and there was every evidence of a
struggle. Between the thicket and the river, the fences
were found taken down and the ground bore evidence
of some heavy burthen having been dragged along it.
   A weekly paper, “Le Soleil,” had the following
comments upon this discovery—comments which
merely echoed the sentiment of the whole Parisian
press:
<d>[<a class="e" id="Ladies-Companion-1842-11-p19" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=uE1FAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA19">Col.1</a>]</d>
<m9>   “<a class="l" href="#Herald-1841-09-17-Col4-Marys-things">The things had all evidently</a> been there at least three or
four weeks; they were all mildewed down hard with the action
of the rain, and stuck together from mildew. The grass had
grown around and over some of them. The silk on the parasol
was strong, but the threads of it were run <u title="together, within the (in Herald)">together within.
The</u> upper part, where it had been doubled and folded, was all
mildewed and rotten, and tore on its being opened. * * * *
The pieces of her frock torn out by the bushes were about
three inches wide and six inches long. One part was the hem
of the frock, and it had been mended; the other piece was part
of the skirt, not the hem. They looked like strips torn off,
and were on the thorn bush, about a foot from the ground.
* * * * * * There can be no doubt, therefore, that the
spot of this appalling outrage has been discovered.”</m9>
   Consequent upon this discovery, new evidence ap-
peared. Madame Deluc testified that she keeps a road-
side inn not far from the bank of the river, opposite the
Barrière du Roule. The neighborhood is secluded—
particularly so. It is the usual Sunday resort of black-
guards from the city, who cross the river in boats.
About three o'clock, in the afternoon of the Sunday in
question, a young girl arrived at the inn, accompanied
by a young man of dark complexion. The two re-
mained here for some time. On their departure, they
took the road to some thick woods in the vicinity.
<a class="l" href="#Herald-1841-09-17-Col3-Marys-dress">Madame Deluc's attention was called to the dress worn</a>
by the girl, on account of its resemblance to one worn
by a deceased relative. A scarf was particularly noticed.
Soon after the departure of the couple, a gang of mis-
creants made their appearance, behaved boisterously,
ate and drank without making payment, followed in the
route of the young man and girl, returned to the inn
about dusk, and re-crossed the river as if in great haste.
   It was soon after dark, upon this same evening, that
Madame Deluc, as well as her eldest son, heard the
screams of a female in the vicinity of the inn. The
screams were violent but brief. Madame D. recog-
nized not only the scarf which was found in the thicket,
but the dress which was discovered upon the corpse.
<a class="l" href="#Herald-1841-09-17-Col3-Adam-stage-driver">An omnibus driver, Valence</a>, now also testified that he
saw Marie Rogêt cross a ferry on the Seine, on the
Sunday in question, in company with a young man of
dark complexion. He, Valence, knew Marie, and
could not be mistaken in her identity. The articles
found in the thicket were fully identified by the rela-
tives of Marie.
   The items of evidence and information thus collected
by myself, from the newspapers, at the suggestion of
Dupin, embraced only one more point—but this was a
point of seemingly vast consequence. It appears that,
<a class="l" title="One month after" href="#Tribune-1841-10-09">immediately after</a> <a class="l" href="#Herald-1841-09-06">the discovery of the clothes</a> as above
described, the lifeless, or nearly lifeless body of St.
Eustache, Marie's betrothed, was found in the vicinity
of what all now supposed the scene of the outrage. A
<a class="l" href="#American-1841-10-09">phial labelled “laudanum,” and emptied, was found</a>
near him. <a class="l" href="#Herald-1841-10-10-Paynes-breath">His breath gave evidence of</a> <a class="l" href="#Herald-1841-10-10-Dr-Cook">the poison</a>.
He died without speaking. Upon his person was found
<a class="l" href="#Tribune-1841-10-11-Payne-to-the-world">a letter</a>, <a class="l" href="#Sun-1841-10-11-Payne-to-the-world">briefly stating</a> his love for Marie, with his de-
sign of self-destruction.
   “I need scarcely tell you,” said Dupin, as he finished
the perusal of my notes,” that this is a far more intri-
cate case than that of the Rue Morgue; from which it
differs in one important respect. This is an <i>ordinary</i>,
although an atrocious instance of crime. There is
nothing peculiarly <i>outré</i> about it. You will observe
<d>[Col.2]</d>
that, for this reason, the mystery has been considered
easy, when, for this reason, it should have been con-
sidered difficult of solution. Thus, at first, it was
thought unnecessary to offer a reward. The myrmi-
dons of G—— were able at once to comprehend how
and why such an atrocity <i>might have been</i> committed.
They would picture to their imaginations a mode—
many modes—and a motive—many motives; and be-
cause it was not impossible that either of these nume-
rous modes and motives <i>could</i> have been the actual
one, they have taken it for granted that one of them
<i>must</i>. But the ease with which these variable fancies
were entertained, and the very plausibility which each
assumed, should have been understood as indicative
rather of the difficulties than of the facilities which must
attend elucidation. I have before observed that it is
by prominences above the plane of the ordinary, that
reason feels her way, if at all, in her search for the true,
and that the proper question in cases such as this, is
not so much 'what has occurred?' as 'what has occur-
red that has never occurred before?' In the investi-
gations at the house of Madame L'Espanage,* the
agents of G—— were discouraged and confounded by
that very <i>unusualness</i> which, to a properly regulated
intellect, would have afforded the sweet omen of suc-
cess; while this same intellect might have been plunged
in despair at the <i>especially</i> ordinary character of all
that met the eye in the case of the perfumery girl, and
told of nothing but easy triumph to the functionaries of
the Prefecture.
   “In the case of Madame L'Espanage and her daugh-
ter, there was, even at the beginning of our investiga-
tion, no doubt that murder had been committed. The
idea of suicide was excluded at once. Here, too, we
are freed, at the commencement, from all supposition
of self-murder. The body found at the Barrière du
Roule, was found under such circumstances as to leave
us no room for embarrassment upon this important
point. But it has been suggested that the corpse dis-
covered, is not that of the Marie Rogêt, for the convic-
tion of whose assassin, or assassins, the reward is
offered, and respecting whom, solely, our agreement
has been arranged with the Prefect. We both know
this gentleman well. It will not do to trust him too
far. If, dating our inquiries from the body found, and
thence tracing a murderer, we yet discover this body to
be that of some other individual than Marie; or, if
starting from the living Marie, we find her, yet find her
unassassinated—in either case we lose our labor; since
it is Monsieur G—— with whom we have to deal.
For our own purpose, therefore, if not for the purpose
of justice, it is indispensable that our first step should
be the determination of the identity of the corpse with
the Marie Rogêt who is missing.
   “I know not what effect the arguments of 'L'Etoile'
may have wrought upon your own understanding.
With the public they have had weight; and that the
Journal itself is convinced of their importance would
appear from the manner in which it commences one of

its essays upon the subject—'Several of the morning
papers of the day,' it says, 'speak of the <i>conclusive</i>
article in Monday's 'Etoile.' To me, this article ap-
pears conclusive of little beyond the zeal of its inditer.
We should bear in mind that, in general, it is the object
of our newspapers rather to create a sensation—to make
a point—than to further the cause of truth. The latter
end is only pursued when it seems coincident with the
former. The print which merely falls in with ordinary
opinion (however well founded this opinion may be)
earns for itself no credit with the mob. The mass of
the people regard as profound only him who suggests
<i>pungent contradictions</i> of the general idea. In ratio-
cination, not less than literature, it is the <i>epigram</i> which
is the most immediately and the most universally ap-
preciated. In both, it is of the lowest order of merit.
   “What I mean to say is, that it is the mingled epi-
gram and melodrame of the idea, that Marie Rogêt
still lives, rather than any true plausibility in this idea,
which has suggested it to 'L'Etoile,' and secured it a
favorable reception with the public. Let us examine
the heads of the argument; endeavoring to avoid the
incoherence with which it is originally set forth.
   “The first aim of the writer is to show, from the
brevity of the interval between Marie's disappearance
and the finding of the floating corpse, that this corpse
cannot be that of Marie. The reduction of this inter-
val to its smallest possible dimension, becomes thus, at
once, an object with the reasoner. In the rash pursuit
of this object, he rushes into mere assumption at the
outset. 'It is folly to suppose,' he says, 'that the mur-
der, if murder was committed on her body, would have
been consummated soon enough to have enabled her
murderers to throw the body into the river before mid-
night.' We demand at once, and very naturally <i>why?</i>
Why is it folly to suppose that the murder was com-
mitted <i>within five minutes</i> after the girl's quitting her
mother's house? Why is it folly to suppose that the
murder was committed at any given period of the day?
There have been assassinations at all hours. But, had
the murder taken place at any moment between nine
o'clock in the morning of Sunday, and a quarter before
midnight, there would still have been time enough 'to
throw the body into the river before midnight.' This
assumption, then, amounts precisely to this—that the
murder was not committed on Sunday at all—and,
if we allow it to assume this, we may permit it any lib-
erties whatever. The paragraph beginning 'It is folly
to suppose that the murder, etc,' however it appears as
printed in L'Etoile, may be imagined to have existed
actually <i>thus</i> in the brain of its inditer—'It is folly to
suppose that the murder, if murder was committed on
the body, could have been committed soon enough to
have enabled her murderers to throw the body into the
river before midnight; it is folly, we say, to suppose
all this, and to suppose at the same time, (as we are
resolved to suppose,) that the body was <i>not</i> thrown in
until <i>after</i> midnight'—a sentence sufficiently inconse-
quential in itself, but not so utterly preposterous as the
one printed.
<d>[Col.2]</d>
   “'Were it my purpose,' continued Dupin 'merely
to <i>make out a case</i> against this passage of L'Etoile's
argument, I might safely leave it where it is. It is not,
however, with L'Etoile that we have to do, but with
the truth. The sentence in question has but one mean-
ing, as it stands; and this meaning I have fairly stated;
but it is material that we go behind the mere words, for
an idea which these words have obviously intended, and
failed to convey. It was the design of the journalist to
say that, at whatever period of the day or night of Sun-
day this murder was committed, it was improbable that
the assassins would have ventured to bear the corpse to
the river before midnight. And herein lies, really, the
assumption of which we complain. It is assumed that
the murder was committed at such a position, and
under such circumstances, that <i>the bearing it</i> to the
river became necessary. Now, the assassination might
have taken place upon the river's brink, or on the river
itself; and, thus, the throwing the corpse in the water
might have been resorted to, at any period of the day
or night, as the most obvious and most immediate mode
of disposal. You will understand that I suggest nothing
here as probable, or as coincident with my own opin-
ion. My design, so far, has no reference to the <i>facts</i>
of the case. I wish merely to caution you against the
whole tone of L'Etoile's <i>suggestion</i>, by calling your
attention to its <i>ex parte</i> character at the outset.
   “Having prescribed thus a limit to suit its own pre-
conceived notions; having assumed that, if this were
the body of Marie, it could have been in the water but
a very brief time; the journal goes on to say:
<m9>   'All experience has shown that drowned bodies, or bodies
thrown into the water immediately after death by violence,
require from six to ten days for decomposition to take place to
bring them to the top of the water. Even when a cannon is
fired over a corpse, and it rises before at least five or six days'
immersion, it sinks again if let alone.'</m9>
   “These assertions have been tacitly received by every
paper in Paris, with the exception of Le Moniteur.
This latter print endeavors to combat that portion of
the paragraph which has reference to 'drowned bodies'
only, by citing some five or six instances in which the
bodies of individuals known to be drowned were found
floating after the lapse of less time than is insisted upon
by 'L'Etoile.' But there is something excessively
unphilosophical in the attempt on the part of 'Le Moni-
teur,' to rebut the general assertion of 'L'Etoile,' by a
citation of particular instances militating against that
assertion. Had it been possible to adduce fifty instead
of five examples of bodies found floating at the end of
two or three days, these fifty examples could still have
been properly regarded as exceptions alone to 'L'-
Etoile's' rule, until such time as the rule itself should
be confuted. Admitting the rule, (and this 'Le Moni-
teur' does not deny, insisting merely upon its excep-
tions,) the argument of L'Etoile is suffered to remain
in full force; for this argument does not pretend to
involve more than a question of the <i>probability</i> of the
body having risen to the surface in less than three days;
and this probability will be in favor of 'L'Etoile's' posi-
tion until the instances so childishly adduced shall be
sufficient in number to establish an antagonistical rule.

	The Day of Judgment Approaching.</b>
<m9>   The undersigned, not having been able to find any cap-
italist in these hard times, in possession of $150,000 in ready
money, the sum required to purchase this establishment,
has come to the resolution to break at once—to take the
benefit of the bankrupt law—to run away with as much
money as he can—and then to carry out the valuable
financial and moral principles of the present enlightened
era of the world, as far and as fast as he can.
   He, therefore, respectfully calls upon all those persons
to whom he is indebted, not to call upon him for any more
money—the honest bankrupt law will pay them all in due
time. There is no use any longer to pay debts, such acts
only create jealousy and dislike among respectable people.
Also, according to the Rev. Mr. Miller, who opens his
tent this day in Newark, the day of judgment is set down
for the 23d of April next. This awful approaching event
is also another motive for the undersigned to become a
highly respectable bankrupt, and to chest as much in as
little time as he can, so as to acquire the esteem and con-
sideration of the financial and fashionable classes of socie-
ty, and also the good will of the newspaper press, who are
generally bankrupt too.
   Yesterday it was reported in Wall street that the paper
of the undersigned was protested by the banks and bro-
kers of that avenue of public and private virtue. This is
too true. The paper of the undersigned has been protest-
ed by these persons and corporations for nearly seven
years—and he has come to the resolution to break and
take the benefit of the act, as the best and wisest thing he
can do in acquiring their esteem and confidence. The
undersigned, like Napoleon, whom he resembles in the
magnitude of his ambition, and the extent of his resources,
has at last been conquered in the field of Waterloo, and
should the Rev. Mr. Miller have made a miscalculation
about the day of judgment, the undersigned has resolved
to retire to Coney Island, and henceforth to make that his
St. Helena for the rest of his natural life.
   In the mean time, until the undersigned shall have got
his certificate of bankruptcy, or positively run away
with $1,2<s title="5 ?">0</s>0,000 of somebody's funds, or till the day of
judgment be set down for certain, he begs to leave to say
that the following periodicals are issued at his office—
viz:—
D<small>AILY</small> H<small>ERALD</small>—Published every day of the year, except
   New Year's Day and Fourth of July—two cents per
   copy—or $7,26 per annum—cash in advance.

   per copy, or $3,12½ per annum—cash in advance.

   12½ cents per copy, or $6,00 per annum—cash in ad-

   Besides these, several other periodicals are in prepara-
tion, which will be announced in due time.
   Advertisers throughout the city and country are also
informed that the aggregate circulation of the H<small>ERALD</small> is
THIRTY THOUSAND, being greater than that of any
other newspaper in the world, and, therefore, it is a better
vehicle for giving publicity to their business notices than
all the others in New York put together. Prices of adver-
tising are also moderate—but invariable cash in advance

   C<small>OLT'S</small> C<small>ASE</small>.—The application for a Writ of
Error, in Colt's case, was denied yesterday by the
Chancellor, he declaring that justice, to be worth
any thing, should be speedy and certain. No further
legal proceedings can take place, and the sentence
of the Judge must either be carried into effect, or
be commuted by the action of the Governor.
   We understand that great efforts are making to
procure a pardon—and that a long petition is now
before the Governor, signed by Dudley Selden,
James Watson Webb, M. M. Noah, Moses Y.
Beach, and such like persons. The probability is that,
from the influence exerted, Colt's punishment will be
changed to imprisonment for life, or for a term of
years. Luck is every thing in such things. When
Murphy, the poor Irishman, took the life of his wife,
in a drunken and insane fit, mourning over the fa-
tality till his death, no mercy was shown him—he
was executed promptly. He humbly acknowledged
his crime—and did not treat the Judge or Jury with
impudence. The petition of clergymen to commute
his punishment had no effect. Colt, however, is al-
together a different character, and no doubt he will
be pardoned to a certain extent. His system of
answering a dun and paying a debt was novel—a
new mode of repudiation with a vengeance—and
deserves special attention and mercy.

   <i>Court of Chancery.—Case of John C. Colt</i>.—In the
case of this very notorious individual, an application
had been made to the Chancellor, under the Revised
Statutes, praying that he would allow a Writ of Er-
ror to the Court of Oyer and Terminer to carry this
case to the Supreme Court or to the Court for the
Correction of Errors, as he should deem proper, and
also for a certificate that there was probable cause
for reversing the Judgment of that Court so that the
Governor might respite the execution of the sentence
until the final decision of the Court of last resort.—
This motion was predicated on the Bill of Exceptions
which was argued before the Supreme Court and the
grounds for the application were:—that the two Al-
dermen were not entitled to sit as Judges of the Court
of Oyer and Terminer—that the Circuit Court Judge
had erred in his decision relative to the empanelling
of the Jury—also in excluding testimony as to the
good character of Caroline Henshaw (Colt's mis-
tress)—and also in admitting testimony to shew that
the death of Adams might have been caused by a
pistol shot. It was also contended that the Court
for Correction of Errors was bound to weigh the tes-
timony in the cae and to decide whether it was suf-
ficient to sustain the verdict that had been rendered.
   The Chancellor having reviewed the objections,
said he was clearly and decidedly of opinion that the
Judge of the Circuit Court was right in his decisions
on the points ruled by him,—that the Court was le-
gally and constitutionally organized, and that the
Court for the Correction of Errors would not review
the question of fact, that being exclusively the prov-
ince of the Jury to judge of and decide upon. On
these grounds he therefore refused to allow the Writ
of Error.
   It will thus be seen that the last resort of the law
<d>[Col.3]</d>
has been had in this case, and there only remains for
the prisoner to have resource to the clemency of the
Governor in order to avoid the execution of the sen-
tence of the law, which unless that clemency is so
exercised must be carried into effect, this day fort-
night.

   <i>The Herald</i>.—A correspondent enquires whether
the advertisement which appeared in our paper a
few days since offering the Herald establishment for
sale, was <i>genuine</i>. Undoubtedly it was, or the Pro-
prietor would not have paid us $9,37 for three in-
sertions.
   Those who are aware that the daily circulation of
the <i>Herald</i>, has fallen off from <i>eleven</i> thousand, its
greatest circulation, to about <i>four</i> thousand; and that
its advertisements are less numerous than those of
any other penny paper in the city, have long been
prepared for its rapidly impending fate. And the fact
of offering it for sale, and at the same time giving
orders for the insertion of the advertisement by all
who exchange with it—besides paying for for its in-
sertion in this and other papers—at a cost of not less
than <i>five hundred dollars</i>, proves sufficiently the des-
perate state of the concern, and the anxiety of the
Editor & Proprietor, or “<i>Head Devil</i>” as he calls
himself, to get rid of it. But this he finds as imprac-
ticable as it is to get rid of the heavy libel suits re-
cently instituted against him by Drs. M<small>OTT</small> and P<small>AT-
TISON</small>, and other members of the University Medical
School.
   The truth is, <i>that</i> ruin which he has so often pre-
dicted as about to overtake what he denominates the
“Wall street Press,” has already overtaken himself.
He finds he has got entirely beyond his depth; and
although he has undoubtedly made money in differ-
ent ways, he begins to feel that it will all be lost un-
less he can get rid of his paper. If as is generally
believed, it is now published at a very heavy daily
loss, we need not be surprised at the extraordinary
announcement made <a class="l" href="#Herald-1842-11-03">in its columns on Thursday</a>
morning, under the following characteristic caption.

BANKRUPTCY AND FINAL EXPLOSION
			OF THE

   The undersigned, not having been able to find any

   The offer of the Herald for sale under the circum-
stances of the case, was conclusive with the public
as regards its future fate; and we have never wit-
nessed more general satisfaction about town than
was created by this admission that the fate of that
infamous sheet was at length sealed; and the an-
nouncement, coupled as it was with a confession that
he who had for years been assailing the peace of fam-
ilies and exposing to the public gaze domestic scenes,
had at length been made to feel in <i>his own person</i> that
misery which he has so constantly meted out to oth-
ers,—inspired a hope at least, that no other and sim-
ilar adventurer, would dare to follow in his footsteps.
   Far be it from us to justify, or even <i>palliate</i> the re-
cent assaults upon the Editor's family or the expo-
sure of his domestic affairs. And although we have
frequently witnessed with disgust and pity the man-
ner in which he has brought forward in his columns
his domestic affairs—the occupations, appearance,
&c. &c. of his wife and child—we do not hold excu-
sable those who seize upon this as a plea for conside-
ring them fair subjects for comment. True, he has
destroyed the peace of many a family, and caused a
greater degree of misery in our city and country,
than the whole thirteen hundred presses of the
Union combined; and if <i>he</i> could be made to feel
without striking through those who are not respon-
sible for his conduct, we should rejoice in his richly
merited punishment. But as this cannot be, the
press canot be held excusable for assailing his
family for transactions with which the public have
no concern; and the instant that they do so, they
place themselves on a par with the individual whose
reckless and unprincipled assaults upon the peace of
families, have so justly rendered him an object of
universal execration.
   The only punishment which can be inflicted upon
such a creature, is through appeals to the law against
his libels, and the refusal of the public to purchase
his filthy sheet. Both of these means have of late
been resorted to; and the result is, the well ascer-
tained fact, that in a very short time our country
will be rid of this moral pestilence. This is a subject
of congratulation to all; and although we fully admit
that he has caused throughout our land a degree of
misery for which the lives of a thousand such as he,
could offer no expiation, we would not <u>that that</u>
misery be increased by striking at him through those
who are not responsible for his conduct, and who
have constantly been brought by him before the pub-
lic in a disgusting and offensive manner, without
their agency, and in hope, against their feelings of
propriety.
   A few brief months will inevitably put an end to his
career, unless a false sympathy is excited in behalf
of those he has so repeatedly and offensively paraded
in his columns; and we therefore call upon the press
to leave him to his fate. His power to do mischief
has measurably ceased; and what is more, is daily
decreasing in consequence of the refusal of the pub-
lic to buy his worthless sheet. Rats, it is said, run
from a sinking ship; and now that he is going down,
even those in his employ help to give him a kick,
and freely expose the real character and extent of
his diminished daily sales. The work is done; the
<i>Herald</i> is virtually dead; and in its death the cause
of good morals and the people of this city and of the
whole Union, have great cause for rejoicing.

			————
   Mr. Dickens made himself so pleasantly familiar
with the public of the British isles, in his monthly
meetings with it under the guise of the facetious and
fine-hearted “Boz,” that his announced departure
for the land of Brother Jonathan, and his consequent
exposure to all the dangers of the sea, was looked
upon as something little short of a national calamity.
There was, however, some consolation entertained
by his clients in the anticipation that, if ever he
came back, it would be with a port-folio replenished
with such sketches from the life of the people at the
other side of what is irreverently styled the herring-
pond as would throw even the Pickwickian fancies
into manifest depreciation—into a perfect clear ob-
scure. From Sam Slick's New England, into the
heart of Old Kentuck, and thence, with an angle
down to Mrs. Trollope's land of promise on the Mis-
sissippi, the hunting grounds for the oddest “criturs”
of game for sportsmen of the Yorick vein, would
have seemed to extend far away; and what shafts
like those feathered by the hand of Boz to take down
these <u title="ferae naturae">feræ naturæ</u>? That they would, moreover,
be dished up with the most pungent sauce, and <u title="consequently">con-
seqeuntly</u> devoured with unspeakable relish, was, no
doubt, also a dream fondly indulged in. Any such
airy fabric must quickly vanish upon the inspection
of the two volumes, which this day make their ap-
pearance in all the bibliopole establishments in the
island.

<b>The New York Herald—Its Position, Pros-
   perity, Circulation and Prospects in two
   Hemispheres.</b>
   We are, beyond the possibility of a doubt, the Na-
poleon of the press in both hemispheres. The New
York Herald is unquestionably the greatest and
mightiest intellectual institution of civilized socie-
ty in the present century. Look a the excitement,
the ferment, the fuss, and the fury which its exis-
tence, progress, power, circulation and influence
cause in both the old and the new world—in Lon-
don and in New York—in the grave quarterly
reviews and in the newspaper press of both conti-
nents.
   It is a phenomenon in the history of civilization.
During the last month, on the other side of the wa-
ter, the “London Foreign Quarterly Review” and
the London newspaper press, have endeavored to
stop our career as they did Napoleon's, by all sorts
of abuse, falsehood and a solitary truth here and
there. On this side of the water, we have an-
nounced our establishment for sale, then withdrew
it—then proposed to take the benefit of the bankrupt
law—then postponed that solemn scene of
whitewashing till doomsday—and straightway the
whole newspaper press, little and great, daily and
weekly, have been in a state of general excitement
and amusing <u title="effervescence">effervesence</u> ever since. They have
stormed, and fumed, and raved, and lied, and puffed,
and sworn, and abused us in all manner of ways.
   This most amusing, most laughable, most absurd,
most silly, most foolish excitement among the co-
temporary newspapers in New York and elsewhere,
have produced one most astounding and curious re-
sult. <i>The circulation of the</i> H<small>ERALD</small>, <i>both in city and
country, has increased so much and so rapidly</i> since
this new war broke out in London, that we have
had to give a large additional order to our paper
manufacturers, for an additional supply of paper, so
as to be able to meet the vast requirements and de-
mands of the community. The following is a copy
of our new contract:—
<m9>		N<small>EW</small> Y<small>ORK</small>, H<small>ERALD</small> O<small>FFICE</small>, Nov. 1, 1842.
M<small>ESSRS</small>. PERSSE & BROOKS:—
	G<small>ENTLEMEN</small>:—
   Please to deliver at the Herald office, New York
   750 reams <i>per week</i> of the small sized paper 23X32—for
the daily Herald.
   Also 60 reams <i>per week</i> of the large sized 32X46 for the
Weekly Herald for one year from this date, to be of quali-
ty equal to this specimen—Payments to be made <i>each week</i>
in cash, in full for that week.
					JAMES G. BENNETT.
   We accept the above order and will deliver it as di-
rected.				PERSSE & BROOKS,
						No. 61 Liberty street.
   J<small>AMES</small> R<small>OWE</small>, } Witnesses.
   S<small>AMUEL</small> B<small>EMAN</small>, }</m9>
   The only paper in this city—we may say in the
world, which requires a supply of paper, or has a
circulation, at all approaching the Herald, is the
New York Sun, a penny paper, circulating only
among the poor people, and through the lanes and
alleys in the city, conducted by one Moses Y. Beach,
a sort of “cod-fish aristocrat.” From his journal
of last Saturday, we extract the following, show-
ing his consumption of paper, and his comparative
circulation:—
<m9>			S<small>UN</small> O<small>FFICE</small>, N. Y., Aug. 29, 1842.
M<small>R.</small> H. V. B<small>UTLER</small>—
   S<small>IR</small>—Please deliver at the Sun Office, N. Y. <i>five hundred
reams of paper per week</i>, for six months from the 15th of
October, 1842, to be of this quality, size, and weight,
the same to be paid for in cash every two weeks.
					M. Y. BEACH.
   I accept the above order, and agree to furnish the paper
accordingly.					H. V. BUTLER.
   Aug. 31, 1842.
   Witness, M. S. BEACH.</m9>
   From these official and authentic documents, it
will be seen that <i>the circulation of the New York
Herald is already nearly double that of the New York
Sun</i>, and as the Sun is acknowledged by all to be
ahead of its cotemporaries, the Herald is ahead of
all, large and small. And, further—without saying
any thing in disparagement of the article manufac-
tured by Mr. H. V. Butler, who is a good paper ma-
ker, we will be permitted to declare that the paper
on which the Herald is printed, is far superior in
quality, in strength, in durability, to that of any
other in the country. For three or four years we
have been supplied by Messrs. Persse & Brooks
having paid them nearly <i>two hundred and fifty thou-
sand dollars in money</i>, during that period—and in all
that time, they have executed our orders with a
promptitude, celerity, integrity and courtesy, with-
out spot or blemish.
   Such are some of the first fruits of the renewal of
the “moral war” against us, and our family, down
to the very babe that cannot yet speak—a moral
war—or rather an immoral war, on a larger scale,
extended to both continents—breaking out simul-
taneously in London and in New York, and set on
foot by <i>cliques</i> of the greatest reprobates and bank-
rupts, that ever disgraced any country, or human
nature itself. With a private life, passed mostly in
New York for nearly <i>twenty-five years</i>, perfectly un-
assailable in every point—perfectly unstained by
any weakness, or any immorality of any kind—
with a public life, open, bold, energetic, industrious
honest, honorable in all our transactions, we have
been assailed by our cotemporaries of the press—and
by <i>cliques</i> of financiers and traders in religion, with
a ferocity and a malignity that makes poor old Sa-
tan, down below, tremble for his laurels in wicked-
ness. We plant ourself on the impregnable rock of
truth, of honor, of humanity, of genius, of decorum,
of pure morals, and of undefiled religion—and we
smile at their puny efforts, and trample in the very
dirt the whole confederacy of Satan, whether in
London or New York—whether in Europe or the
United States—whether in Wall street or its coun-
terpart, the bottomless pit. We possess the sympa-
thy of the age—we are actuated by the true spirit
of civilization, and, armed with the weapons of truth
and virtue, we shall go forth conquering and to con-
quer, until the revolution be complete, and morals,
religion and true philosophy shall triumph.
   Encouraged, therefore, by the vast increase of
our establishment—by its impregnable solidity—by
its great resources, we now announce to the world,
that the N<small>EW</small> Y<small>ORK</small> H<small>ERALD</small> <i>will not be sold</i>—that the
benefit of the bankrupt law shall not be taken—(that
was a sarcasm which they feigned not to under-
stand)—and that the original project of establishing
branches of the Herald in London and Paris, for
the renovation of the old world, and the future
triumph of the new, shall be carried out without
fail, at an early day. We value the whole estab-
lishment of the Herald at $150,000. It is wholly
without encumbrance or debt, except a mortgage of
$20,000 on a building, worth $30,000, given to
Mr. Temegnio, of Fulton street, of whom it was
bought, and who receives his interest regularly.
	...
   The present era is favorable for the advancement
and improvement of the newspaper press, and the
folly, avarice, and malevolence of our rivals, have
made us that master spirit of the age, which in our
most halcyon days we never dreamed of. The
<d>[Col.2]</d>
millennium is begun. These weak men have made
us that Napoleon of the press whom they fear—
and we suppose, willing or unwilling, we must com-
plete the great work of revolution in the civilized
world, which that great and mighty man failed to
carry out. He took the reins of the great move-
ment of the last century, which originated in the
French Revolution, and which, for a few years, he
seemed to understand. But he was lured from his
principles, decoyed from his position, and, leaguing
himself with the old feudal monarchies of Europe,
he lost his <i>prestige</i>, fell into errors, and ended his
days as a solitary outcast on St. Helena.
   The great moral and philosophical revolution was
thus stopped “in mid career,” and since then, except
in this holy land of freedom, the age has stood still
—the pool of Bethsaida has been stagnant—the an-
gel has not descended on its waters. The time has
now come to renew the great work, under more fa-
vorable auspices, with different weapons, and higher
hopes of ultimate success. War has ceased, never
more to be. Steam and the press, applied by skil-
ful engineers, are attaining their legitimate position
	...
   With these brief views we submit our position,
our prospects, our purposes, our case and our char-
acter to an enlightened community, and have no
fears of an unfavorable response. Indeed, we have
already their approbation—their decided approba-
tion in their ample and substantial patronage—in our
wonderfully increasing circulation—in our growing
advertising custom—and in the generous indigna-
tion which is felt among all the honest classes of so-
ciety against the ferocious assaults made upon our
reputation and character by a league of political,
literary, financial, medical, and editorial bankrupts
of all shades and all sizes. If they do not repent, and
that quickly, we may consign them to unutterable
perdition.
   N. B. The following popular periodicals are pub-
lished at this office, Herald Buildings, north west
corner of Fulton and Nassau streets:—
   NEW YORK LANCET, published weekly, price
12½ cents per single copy—8 cens by the quantity.
	...
   ADVERTISERS are informed that the circula-
tion of the Herald is over THIRTY THOUSAND,
and increasing fast. It is, therefore, the best channel
for business men in the city or country. Prices
moderate—cash in advance.

	ARRIVAL OF THE GREAT WESTERN.
	...
   There is nothing better to send by the Great Wes-
tern, than the Notes for general circulation, by Mr.
Charles Dickens—which will reach the United States
by this steam-ship. The work could not be obtained
in time for the Caledonia, and is yet not much be-
fore the public here—but it is thought to be general-
ly a much more sensible and valuable production than
was anticipated from the <i>forte</i> of the writer and the
foolish title under which it was announced. There
is, however, a laboured, stilted and absurd paragraph
against the newspaper press of the United States—
but in which Mr. Dickens must be supposed to be
honest, because the newspaper trumpet was blown
immeasurably too high in his own praise. The re-
marks on the factory girls at Lowell, are very fine
and as this part of the work will go the round of the
kingdom in the weekly papers, Mr. Dickens will
have probably done excellent service to the manu-
facturing population here. To the aristocracy there
is much in these notes which will be gall itself.
	...
			—————
   Boz.—The <i>Great Western</i> has brought out D<small>ICK-
ENS</small>' “American Notes for General Circulation.” In
running our eye over its pages, we find nothing in it
of a very striking character, except that after speak-
ing very disparagingly of the “American Press,” he
<i>endorses</i> in all its length and breadth, the late article
in the “Foreign Quarterly,” for which we doubt not,
he furnished the material, and which he caused to be
written, if he did not write himself.
   The following extract, will satisfy the friends of
Mr. D<small>ICKENS</small> that if he be not the writer of that in-
famous review, he is willing to endorse it and vouch
for its accuracy:
<l9>   “<a title="Vol.2, p.297" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=WQolAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA297">Or let him refer</a> to an <i>able and</i> PERFECTLY

		  ARRIVAL OF THE
	<f12 style="letter-spacing:.2em">GREAT WESTERN.</f12>
		THREE DAYS LATER.
   The Great Western, from Bristol 22d ult., arri-
ved at six o'clock last evening, bringing London
and Liverpool papers to her day of sailing, to-
gether with a large number of passengers, and
Dickens' new book entitled “Notes on Ame-
rica,” for a copy of which we are indebted to our
attentive and enterprising Liverpool correspon-
dents, Messrs. Wilmer and Smith.
   We find no political news of interest in our
ample files. Mr. Dickens' book is largely ex-
tracted from by the London press, and from a
cursory glance over those extracts, we judge that
he has made out a work which the Americans
will have some little reason to find fault with.
   His observations upon the public and charitable
institutions of Boston, including the lunatic asy-
lums and gaols, contain matter not only of ab-
sorbing interest to the philanthropist, but of the
very highest importance to the legislator and
economist.
   He has some pointed and stringent remarks
upon the American representatives, to which we
can now do more than simply refer our readers,
and with an account of his presentation to the
President Mr. Dickens concludes his first volume.
   The London Chronicle thus closes a summary
view of the general character of the work:—
<l9>   “We have here, we believe, an impartial book
on America, so far as it professedly extends, and
for so much as it professedly comprises. The
author praises when he is pleased, and blames
when he is annoyed or disgusted; but his praise
and blame are alike referable to broad principles
of right and wrong, and are not the indiscriminate
outpourings of personal petulance or national pre-
justice.
	...
   “He has not conceived it his bounden duty to
abuse every thing in exact ratio to the extent of
its difference from the “English fashion,” nor,
because he is an ardent lover of liberty, has he
imagined a necessary perfection in every thing
American because it is republican.
   “His volumes have not the air of being manufac-
tured to a publisher's order, because former books
by the same hand have “taken the town,” but are
fresh, stirring and vigorous. He never twaddles—
indeed to Dickens that would be impossible—but,
which is better praise, he never <i>Trollopises</i>.”</l9>

	<b>Dickens' Notes on America.</b>
   We continue to give to-day a few more racy ex-
tracts from the <i>brochure</i> of Boz on the United States.
These passages, including those of yesterday, com-
prehend the principal portions of the “Notes,” and
the results, or the conclusions he draws from the
facts, scenes, incidents and events, with which that
famous penny-a-liner became acquainted in this
country. The rest are all “leather and prunella,”
hardly worth the trouble of perusal, and certainly
not entitled to any further attention from any sensi-
ble man, either American or European.
   The first point that strikes the reader in these last
passages, is the bold endorsement by Charles Dick-
ens, under his own name, of the remarkable article
in the “Foreign Quarterly Review,” which, on its
first appearance here, excited the astonishment of
those who got up <i>fetes</i>, dinners, and balls to his
glorification, and the general wonder of the whole
country, at the audacity and ingratitude of the cock-
ney. We believe that not one in this city, not even
the gentlemen of the committees, with their
badges in their button holes, will doubt now that
Charles Dickens is the author of that Review—or at
least that he furnished all the materials and ideas.
The circumstantial evidence, by comparing the con-
cluding chapter of his <i>brochure</i> with the “Review,”
is so strong, so conclusive, that any honest jury of
twelve men would hang a culprit on such testimony.
	...
   The identity of authorship being established, di-
rectly and indirectly, between the Book and the
Review, we may proceed at once to consider them
as one emanation, divided into two parts, from the
same mind—and that mind, the most coarse, vul-
gar, impudent, and superficial, that ever had the
courage to write about the ideas and institutions of
this original and remarkable country. His view
of the fermenting character of this land, is the
view taken by a narrow-minded, conceited cockney,
without a single spark of philosophical elevation to
separate the dross from the gold, or to take in a
correct general idea of the multitude of principles
and interests that are effervescing in the republic.
	...
   Of all the travellers that ever visited this land,
Dickens appears to have been the most flimsy—
the most childish—the most trashy—the most con-
temptible. He has neither common grammar,
sense, arrangement, nor generalization. He sur-
passes Hamilton, Fiddler, Trollope, Marryatt, and
seems to be the essence of balderdash reduced to
the last drop of silliness and insanity.
	...
   There is every appearance, from this and other
works, that a grand conspiracy has been concerted
by the stock-jobbers, book-jobbers, and government
jobbers of Europe, to depreciate and libel the cha-
racter of the American people, in all the elements of
society and government. The credit of the Gene-
ral Government has just been crushed by such a
combination among their capitalists, on the ostensi-
ble ground that some of the States repudiate, or are
unable to meet their engagements. American
literature, manners, and morals, are to be deprecia-
ted by a like conspiracy among the penny-a-liners
and book-makers. And there are <i>cliques</i> of block-
heads in this city, so recreant to every feeling of
self-respect and patriotism, as to aid and assist such
a detestable movement in order to destroy the in-
fluence of America upon Europe and the world.
   Out upon all such miserable creatures! We shall
now proceed to give a full and real history of Dick-
ens' tour in the United States—with all the amusing
and ridiculous scenes, illustrated with engravings,
done up to the life, just as they took place between
him and his toadying committees in Boston, Hart-
ford, New York, and elsewhere. It will make a much
racier <i>brochure</i> than he has yet written, and will be
interspersed with appropriate philosophical conclu-
sions at the end of every chapter. It will be
“Specie” to the “Notes.”
			———————
   A M<small>ORAL</small> S<small>PECTACLE</small>.—We have every reason to
believe that the election which begins and ends to-
day, will be a moral spectacle of order, decency
and propriety, sufficient to stamp falsehood on the
assertions made by Charles Dickens on the public
manners of this country.
   Let every man vote quietly such a ticket as he
chooses—let all those that hang round the polls be-
have properly—let there be no riots—no disputes—
no rows—no differences. The eyes of the world
are upon you, and you must give an example of the
order which can prevail, during a general election,
in a city of half a million of inhabitants, and voters
over 40,000 freemen. Democracy is not disorder.

principal streets were full of newsboys, bawling out

   Probably more copies of “Boz's Notes” were

   J. C. C<small>OLT'S</small> C<small>ASE</small>.—This is, indeed, an unfor-
tunate young man. Unfortunately, certainly, if
guilty of the awful crime of wilful murder; and
pitifully unfortunate, if executed, yet innocent of
the wicked intent. “<i>When I am satisfied</i>,” said
the generous La Fayette, “<i>of the infallibility of
human testimony and human judgment, I shall be
satisfied of the legalized death of a human being,
but not till then</i>.” Such was the sentiment of one
of the noblest hearts that ever throbbed with hu-
man tenderness. Now that passion has subsided,
and sober reason resumed her sway, candor will
listen to argument, and humanity thirst for truth
in this case. Frail humanity may be enthralled in
inflexible difficulties without seeking them, all
will admit. There is no crime in leaning to the
side of mercy and humanity, for the most for-
giving and merciful said, “It is better that nine-
ty and nine guilty persons should go unpunish-
ed, than that one innocent person should suffer.”

<h2>Indians—Place Them Beyond</h2>

		<b>Sacs and Foxes.</b>
   The Editor of the Iowa Gazette attended the late
treaty-making Council between Gov. Chambers
and the Sacs and Foxes, and in his last paper has
an article on the subject, from which we extract
the following:
<l9>   The Sacs and Foxes are perhaps the finest look-
ing Indians on the globe—of large, athletic and
perfect forms, and most graceful carriage—and a
brave, highminded and honorable set of fellows.
There are few men in this world equal to the cele-
brated Keokuk, whose commanding oratory raised
him even in his youth from the common ranks of
his tribe, and placed him, without hereditary right
and in despite of all competition, at the head of
his nation. Many statesmen in our own govern-
ment might learn useful lessons in diplomacy, and
many of our best orators receive profitable instruc-
tions form this gifted Indian.
   The younger son of Black Hawk is the Adonis
of his tribe, and is probably the handsomest man
in the world. He is six feet three or four inches
high, graceful and elegant in his manners, and al-
though weighing perhaps two hundred, he treads
as lightly as an infant. <i>Kish-ke-kosh</i>, a chief of
much distinction among them, is also a talented
and fine looking man, and though brave as <u title="Caesar">Cæsar</u>,
he is a regular built Brummel exquisite. He usu-
ally sports an ebony cane, with a gloriously large
and bright brass head, which he twirls in his <u title="fingers">fin-
ger</u> in the most elegant style imaginable, and when
sitting rests his chin and lips upon the brilliant or-
nament a la 'the fine old English gentleman.' He
is a smiling chap, and celebrated as a gallant, as
your smiling gentlemen usually are. It was rather
amusing to witness his efforts to come the polite
thing over his brother savages.
   Every night the Indian camp was converted into
a vast ball-room, and every variety of dances
known among them, from the 'clothing of the
dead,' to the flat-boat 'double shuffle,' were per-
formed by them. The squaws have no part in
these amusements, and usually manifest but little
curiosity to witness these performances. It is any
thing but dancing, according to our notions, con-
sisting as it does of violent stamping upon the
ground to the measured beat of a drum—a regular
tearing up of the earth—or, as the Mississippi in-
dictment expresses it, “kicking up a d—d fuss
generally,” though there is a system in it, and we
noticed that the dancers preserved excellent time.
The chiefs and braves are the principal performers
in these scenes.
   In addition to the beating of the drum, the
dances are enlivened by perhaps the wildest and
most hideous yells that ever issued from the
throats of human beings. And although a good
Christian might think that all Pandemonium had
been turned loose upon our prairies yet, strange
to say, there is music in the horrid compound.—
When all things are put into full blast—the drum
beating, the dancers moving, and singers yelling—
hundreds of Indian dogs join in the delightful cho-
rus, and it is then that the air is made redolent
with savage sound, which makes the listener
quake while he laughs at the superlatively ludi-
crous character of the whole scene before him.—
The younger members of the tribe amuse them-
selves, some by aping the dancers at a respectful
distance, and others by wrestling, foot races, &c.
   Most of these young rascals have horses of their
own, and it was laughable while pitiable to see them
abuse the poor animals by running them from morn-
ing till night, sometimes in races, and at others
without any apparent motive but to “cut a
<u title="splurge (elsewhere)">plunge</u>.”
   This is the only thing we have against the Sacs
and Foxes—they have no mercy on horses. The
abuse of these noble animals is the meanest sin
which any one, white, red or black, can commit.—
It is a great mistake that Indians are stoics, mis-
anthropics, or any thing of the kind.
   A more sociable, communicative, happy or laugh-
ing set of fellows then the Sacs and Foxes do not
exist any where. But we believe it not only im-
possible but impolitic to civilize them. They are
happier as they are—and we should regret any at-
tempt to interfere with their domestic policy.—
Place them beyond the corrupting influence of the
white settlements—keep from them that destroyer
of human happiness among all colors, the death-
dealing “fire-water”—and Government will then

   I<small>NDIAN</small> D<small>IFFICULTIES</small>.—Col. Taylor has given
notice to the Seminoles, who have taken posses-
sion of a portion of the Cherokee country, that they
must remove by the 1st instant. Alligator, who is
at the head of that band of Seminoles, has avowed
his determination to remain where he is. He says
there are not United States soldiers enough in the
country to force him off, and he will not leave. It
is, therefore, probable that the war with the Semi-
noles will be renewed on our Western frontier.

with the Sauks and Foxes turns out to be correct.
From ten to fifteen millions of acres of land are
ceded to the U. States, for a little more than a
million of dollars. If the treaty be confirmed, the
Indians are to be moved to White Breast, near
the forks of the Des Moines, by the 1st of May.

   T<small>HE</small> H<small>ARPERS</small> have published in book form Dick-
ens' new work on this country for one shilling. The
price at which his book sells in this country, will
prove not a little annoying to its author. As to its
merits we have not yet had curiosity or leisure
enough to do more than glance at a few extracts,
and from these it is hardly fair to form an opinion of
the whole book.

<d>[Col.3]</d>
		[<i>For the N. Y. American</i>.]
   Mr. E<small>DITOR</small>—The eccentricities and inconsisten-
cies of the law are often made the subject of bitter
denunciation, especially by parties coming fresh from
a conflict within its arena, and with their animosities
excited by defeat. How far these may be just at
times it is not worth while at present to conjecture.
It is sufficient merely to say that where the contro-
versy affects the civil rights only of individuals, if there
be an absurdity in the legal adjudication of the diffi-
culty, the consequences are not fatal and may be said
to be confined to the party in interest; because the
injury, if it arise from any glaring impropriety in the
law, will be sure to be stopped in its further progress
by a speedy adjustment and cure, applied by the pro-
per authorities entrusted with that duty. But it is a
very different thing when a manifest wrong occurs in
a legal adjudication which affects the life of an indi-
vidual. And I am induced to this remark by what I
have seen in the papers respecting the refusal of the
Circuit Judge, the Supreme Court Judges and finally
of the Chancellor, to allow a writ of error in Colt's
case for the purpose of having his trial reviewed by
the Court for the Correction of Errors. The Stat-
ute declares a writ of error to be a writ of right; but
makes it necessary in criminal cases, if a convict
wishes a stay of proceedings for the purpose of ap-
pealing, to apply to certain officers who have power
to grant a stay until the decision of the Supreme
Court.
   The statute is silent as to what may be afterwards
done for a further stay, if the criminal wishes to ap-
peal to the Court of Errors. But as the statute de-
clares there shall be no stay without an order, and
as that stay only continues until the decision of the
Supreme Court, the criminal is in the awkward po-
sition of one entitled by the Law of the Land, as
matter of right to have his case reviewed by the
Court of Errors, who have power to reverse his judg-
ment, and for whom no provision is made to stay the
<u title="execution">executon</u> of his sentence, (which in Colt's case is
death,) until that decision is given. This is an
absurdity, which were it a case of mere property,
which the parties could recover back if the judgment
turned out erroneous, would be endurable; but in the
present case, which is one of life and death, it is too
solemn and serious a defect to be calmly considered.
In Colt's case, it seems application was made to the
Chancellor for a stay of proceedings. By what
authority the Chancellor is invested with power to
grant or not a stay of proceedings in such a case, I
know not. He has no such power. A writ of error
is a writ of right; and what I complain of, is that this
being so, a man who is convicted of a capital of-
fence has no benefit of this writ of right, because the
Law has no provision for the stay of his execution,
after the decision of the Supreme Court—and it
struck me as a solemn farce, that the Chancellor
should sit on the woolsack and gravely deny in effect
the right of a criminal, situated as Colt was,
to have the decision of the Supreme Court;
reviewed by the Court of Errors, or, if admit-
ting the right, that he should seriously announce
from his own mouth, and with his own unaided
judgment, what the decision of that Court must ne-
cessarily be. Have the Court of Errors never re-
versed a decree of the Chancellor? Have they
never reversed a decision of the Supreme Court?—
And with the power now vested in them to reverse
the decision in Colt's case, whereby he might be re-
stored to liberty, or at any rate saved from death,
we find him handed over summarily to the execu-
tioner, before he can have any benefit of this privi-
lege which the law gives him as matter of right.
   There is a sad defect, then, in this, that no pro-
vision is made for such a case. And there being
none, it is somewhat awful to hear the Chancellor, to
whom application was made from the necessity of
the case, in effect, that a man under sentence of
death, was an exception to the whole community,
in respect to the enjoyment of this common privi-
lege, because <i>he</i> thought the Court of Errors ought
not to reverse his judgment.

<d>[Col.3]</d>
   D<small>ICKENS'S</small> B<small>OOK ON</small> A<small>MERICA</small>.—The Harpers,
yesterday, issued Dickens's “American Notes for
General Circulation,” in a pamphlet of ninety-two
pages, for the price of one shilling. It appears
likely to fulfil the promise of its title, and to be
a work for general circulation, at least in this city.
Every body buys it, and every body reads it. It
consists of notes made in a hasty journey through
the country, in which much that is just and true
is mingled with mistaken views and inaccurate
conclusions. Mr. Dickens was but four months in
the United States, and allowing him to make the
best use of his opportunity, must have gone back
without knowing much of the country or its people.
He reprehends many things, it is true, very prop-
erly, and satirizes others amusingly. Of the latter,
what he says of the national abomination of tobacco
chewing and spitting is an example; of the former,
his reprobation of the ferocity and malignity of par-
ty spirit and the licentiousness of the press. In
regard to the newspaper press, however, though its
character is bad enough, he has overcharged his
censures. The journals of several of our principal
cities, Boston, Philadelphia and Charleston, are
quite as decorous, for aught we see, as the best of the
English journals. In this city, the newspaper
press is worse than any where else in the United
States; but the example of two or three presses in
New-York does not prove the general profligacy
with which all the newspapers in the Union are
conducted. It is true that the best of us probably
have something to amend, and it is true also that the
standard both of morality and of decorum, is not
sufficiently high among the greater number of
those who manage our newspapers. Without at-
tempting to justify them by the example of the
London journals, which perhaps would not be dif-
ficult, if comparison were a fair mode of justifica-
tion, we have no objection to see the scourge of
reproof well laid on, and let those wince who feel
the smart.

<l9>   T<small>HE</small> T<small>REATY WITH THE</small> S<small>AC AND</small> F<small>OX</small> I<small>NDIANS</small>.
—We give below the Burlington Gazette account
of this treaty. One of the editors of that paper,
was present at the agency when the treaty was
made, and therefore the account given may be re-
lied upon as correct.
   T<small>HE</small> N<small>EW</small> T<small>REATY</small>.—It is with feelings of sin-
cere pleasure that we announce to our readers, at
home and abroad, the successful result of the re-
cent negotiation with the Sac and Fox nation, for
all their country adjoining our western frontier.—
After a week spent in talks with the Commissioner,
and in anxious councils among themselves, the In-
dians, on Saturday last, agreed to the proposition
which had been made for the purchase of their
country. The principal terms of the treaty are as
follows:
   The Indians relinquish their right to all their
country, embracing some twelve millions of acres,
for the sum of one million of dollars, out of which
they are to pay two hundred thousand dollars of
their debts, the General Government assuming the
balance which it is supposed, will amount to about
sixty thousand dollars more. The remaining eight
hundred thousand dollars are to be invested in five
per cent. stocks, and the interest (forty thousand
dollars) to be paid annually and forever to the In-
dians. The Indians are to give possession on the
first of May next, of all that portion of country
(adjoining our western boundary) which lies east of
a line running due north to the neutral ground and
south to the State line of Missouri, beginning at
the Painted or Red Rocks of the White Breast Fork
of the Des Moines River, which are said to be lo-
cated about eight miles west of the point of junc-
tion of the two streams. The Indians are to be
permitted to occupy the country west of this line
for three years—meantime government is to pro-
vide them a country on the south and west side of
the Missouri River. No reservations were made
for the benefit of half-breeds, although anxiously
desired by the Indians—but a section of land em-
bracing the Agency House and improvements, was
donated to the heirs of the late able and faithful
Indian Agent, Gen. Street—the Indians to pay the
government the estimated value of the house. A
national fund of thirty thousand dollars, is to be
provided from their annuities, and replenished
yearly, for the support of their poor, the employ-
ment of physicians for their sick, &c. &c.
   The scope of country which will be delivered
into our possession by the first of May next, em-
braces from four to six millions of choice farming
lands, abounding in streams and springs of purest
water, lead and iron ore, mill seats and water pow-
er unequalled, with every desirable quantity of tim-
ber and bituminous coal. Altogether, it is the
richest and most desirable country ever purchased,
and better than any now in possession of any other
tribe of Indians. We predict that the rapidity of
its settlement will be without a parallel in the his-
tory of the world.
   It was stated by the Indians, in the course of
their talks with the Commissioner, that in addition
to the coal, lead and iron known to exist in the
country, there was also an abundance of metal un-
derstood to be copper, and a salt lake and numer-
ous salt springs embraced within the limits of the
purchase. Should this be true, (and we have no
reason to doubt it) Iowa will possess more sources
of natural wealth than all the balance of the Union
put together, and can be equalled only by the In-
dies. It will be susceptible of supporting not only
millions upon its surface, but thousand under
ground.
   But with all this magnificent acquisition of <u title="territory">ter-
tory</u>, we are still an hundred miles from the Mis-
sourie, the Pottowattomie reservation of five mil-
lions of acres intervening between our western
boundary and the banks of that noble river. It is
not reasonable to suppose that such a state as Iowa
will soon be numbering hundreds of thousands of
people, and teeming with wealth from every mine
and over every plain and along the banks of every
stream, will halt in her march to greatness untill
she shall have encompassed within her limits eve-
ry foof of land lying between these two great arte-
ries of the commercial world, the Mississippi and
the Missouri. The former already washed the whole
length of our eastern boundary; and it is the uner-
ring decree of destiny that the latter only shall put
limits to our western border.
   A state, bounded on two sides by such rivers as
the Mississippi and the Missouri, and traversed
throughout its width by numerous smaller ones—
some of them navigable and all of them affording
any amount of water-power; a state more than
three hundred miles square, affording a fine farm to
every section, and unequalled in the wealth and in-
exhaustible in the amount of its minerals; what is
there to prevent such a state from speedily taking
the front rank in our confederacy in the matter of
business and population?</l9>

By
	C<small>HARLES</small> D<small>ICKENS</small>.
   By a certain class of American critics this book
has been laid upon the table—a predestined vic-
tim—dedicated to the knife and scorching flame,
in thought, even before it was born, and bodily as
soon as it made its appearance upon our Republi-
can shores. At the hands of its author these men
feel that they have received some deep insult—
some terrible wrong—in return for which they
have vowed to immolate all his luckless offspring
that from this day forth may venture to look out
upon the earth, though they be lovely as their el-
der brethren and plead for mercy with eloquence
like the music of an Angel. Why this should be
so, they are puzzled to tell; they once thought
him 'one of the gods,' and are, beyond all doubt,
not a little chagrined to find that their worship
does not meet as prompt payment as they demand
for all such religious deference. He has ventured
to hint, moreover, in their presence, and without
their fear before his eyes, that he has Rights as
well as the rest of the world; and he makes no
scruple of asking them to recognize and respect
those rights. There is something in this to their
minds superlatively impudent, and their spleen
rises that a <i>foreigner</i> should dream of his rights,
in a land where the rights of <i>all</i> are respected
and secured. Still he perseveres in his proclama-
tion of wrongs unredressed—and they too in their
wrath. Their anger begets fear. They know
	...
   We have read the book very carefully, and are
forced to say, in the face of all this stormy denun-
ciation, that, so far as its tone toward this Coun-
try is concerned, it <i>is one of the very best works
of its class we have ever seen</i>. There is not a
sentence in it which seems to have sprung from ill-
nature or contempt; not a word of censure is ut-
tered for its own sake or in a fault-finding spirit;
the whole is a calm, judicious, gentlemanly, un-
exceptionable record of what the writer saw—and
a candid and <i>correct</i> judgement of its worth and
its defects. How a writer could look upon the
broadly blazoned and applauded slanders of his
own land which abound in this—how he could run
through the pages of L<small>ESTER</small>'s book—filled to the
margin with the grosses, most unfounded and il-
liberal assaults upon all the institutions and the
social phases of Great Britain—and then write so
calmly of this country, with so manifest a freedom
from passion and prejudice as D<small>ICKENS</small> has done,
is to us no slight marvel. That he has done it is
infinitely to his credit, and confirms us in the opin-
ion we had long since formed of the soundness of
his head and the goodness of his heart. So far as
our space will permit we propose to give some
hasty account of the book—though the extent of
its circulation throughout the city has in no slight
degree forestalled our endeavor.
   The first two chapters are entitled 'Going
Away' and 'The Passage Out';—they are mainly
descriptive, and are strongly marked by that mi-
nuteness of detail which always give such exact-
ness and life to his pictures. His description of
sea-sickness is more vivid than any other we have
ever read, and not the most inveterate weeping-
philosopher, at least of modern times, could re-
fuse to laugh—long and heartily—at the state of
things on board the vessel—which in his descrip-
tion, in all their grotesque reality, stand close before
him. Is not this a lively and perfectly accurate
picture of the performances of a vessel in a storm,
and of the ludicrous feeling of confused astonish-
ment with which a passenger on first awaking be-
holds them all?
<l9>   “<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=onI-WL7FpTAC&pg=PA8">It is the third morning</a>. I am awakened out
of my sleep by a dismal shriek from my wife, who
demands to know whether there is any danger. I
rouse myself and look out of bed. The water-jug
is plunging and leaping like a lively dolphin; all
the smaller articles are afloat, except my shoes,
which are stranded on a carpet-bag, high and dry,
like a couple of coal-barges. Suddenly I see them
spring into the air, and behold the looking-glass,
which is nailed to the wall, sticking fast upon the
ceiling. At the same time the door entirely dis-
appears, and a new one opens in the floor. Then
I begin to comprehend that the state-room is stand-
ing on its head.
	...</l9>
   Of Boston—which was the first city he visited—
its citizens and charitable institutions, he speaks in
terms of the warmest admiration. The candor
<d>[Col.2]</d>
with which their high merits are set forth is most
marked and honorable; and the frequency with
which he contrasts the charities of his own land
with those of this, proves that his object in coming
hither was, not to spy out the nakedness of our
land, but to gather motives and means for he im-
provement of his own. He examined carefully the
charitable institutions of all the principal cities
which he visited, and gives the marked preference
in all respects to those of Boston. In the Lunatic
Asylum, the Alms House, the Long Island Jail,
and the Tombs of our own City he saw much to
censure—their uncleanliness, their lack of suitable
ventilation, and above all, the madness with which
their care is made dependent upon the strife of
party politics. Still he does not forget the pecu-
liar difficulties under which New-York, as the
largest Commercial City on the Continent, un-
avoidably labors. The system of solitary impris-
onment practiced in Philadelphia he most elo-
quently condemns. He paints most vividly the
mental horrors which hang around these gloomy
cells, and expresses censure of the system in the
following conclusive paragraph:
<l9>   “<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=onI-WL7FpTAC&pg=PA43">My firm conviction</a> is, that, independent of the
mental anguish it occasions—an anguish so acute
and so tremendous, that all imagination of it must
fall far short of the reality—it wears the mind into
a morbid state, which renders it unfit for the rough
contact and busy action of the world. It is my fixed
opinion that those who have undergone this punish-
ment, <small>MUST</small> pass into society again morally un-
healthy and diseased. There are many instances
on record, of men who have chosen, or have been
condemned, to lives of perfect solitude, but I
scarcely remember one, even among sages of strong
and vigorous intellect, where its effect has not be-
come apparent, in some disordered train of thought,
or some gloomy hallucination. What monstrous
phantoms, bred of despondency and doubt, and
born and reared in solitude, have stalked upon the
earth, making creation ugly, and darkening the
face of Heaven!
   “It seems to me that the objection that nothing
wholesome or good has ever had its growth in such
unnatural solitude, and that even a dog, or any of
the more intelligent among beasts, would pine, and
mope, and rust away beneath its influence, would
be in itself a sufficient argument against this sys-
tem.	...</l9>
  Of Lowell and its manufacturing establishments
he speaks in terms of unqualified admiration. Of
the Lowell Offering, a monthly published by the
factory girls he says, that “putting entirely out
of sight the fact of the articles having been written
after the arduous labors of the day, it will compare
advantageously with a great many English An-
nuals.” The cheerful happiness, the thrift, indus-
try and intelligence which he saw there could not
fail to remind him of similar establishments in his
own land; and of the contrast between the two he
thus speaks:
<l9>   “<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=onI-WL7FpTAC&pg=PA29">The contrast would be a strong one</a>, for it
would be between the Good and Evil, the living
light and deepest shadow. I abstain from it, be-
cause I deem it just to do so. But I only the
more earnestly abjure all those whose eyes may
rest on these pages, to pause and reflect upon the
difference between this town and those great haunts
of desperate misery; to call to mind, if they can
in the midst of party strife and squabble, the efforts
that must be made to purge them of their suffer-
ing and danger; and last and foremost, to remem-
ber how the precious Time is rushing by.”</l9>
   Is this the language of a man who takes delight
only in denouncing all Institutions but his own?—
The defects of Colleges and higher Seminaries of
learning in this Country have been a standing
theme for exaggeration and abuse by foreigners;
how nobly does the following paragraph contrast
with their blind and heedless denunciation:
<l9>   “<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=onI-WL7FpTAC&pg=PA13">There is no doubt</a> that much of the intellectu-
al refinement and superiority of Boston is refera-
ble to the quiet influence of the University of
Cambridge, which is within three or four miles of
the city. The resident professors of that universi-
ty are gentlemen of learning and varied attain-
ments; and are, without one exception that I can
call to mind, men who would shed a grace upon,
and do honor to, any society in the civilized world.
	...</l9>
   We have not space to follow Boz in his travels
through the Country, or even to refer to the many
occasions for applause, or the fewer for censure,
which he found. He does not fail to notice—
nor does any English traveler who has ever been
among us—the universal and most disgusting habit
of tobacco-chewing, with its attendant abomina-
tions, which met his view in every part of the
land. Those addicted to the practice will of
course be indignant at the <i>liberty</i> he takes; but
few can doubt for a moment the propriety of his
censure. The scenes of brutality too often exhib-
ited in the Halls of Congress, the choice epithets
bandied about among 'honorable members,' the
amiable promises to 'cut each others' throats' in
which some of the chosen spirits among them oc-
casionally indulge, and the shameful exhibitions of
party hatred, of personal malignity and all base
passion which are too often witnessed there, are
spoken of <i>precisely as they deserve</i>, and precise-
ly as every man who loves his country and hates
those who stamp upon its character indelible dis-
grace and proclaim its infamy to all the world,
would expect and wish to hear. Does not the
<d>[Col.3]</d>
conscience of every fair-minded man tell him that
the following words, burning as they are, are found-
ed in essential truth?
<l9>   <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=onI-WL7FpTAC&pg=PA46">Where sat the many legislators of coarse threats</a>;
of words and blows such as coal-heavers deal upon
each other, when they forget their breeding? On
every side. Every session had its anecdotes of
that kind, and the actors were all there. Did I
recognize in this assembly, a body of men who,
applying themselves in a new world to correct
some of the falsehoods and vices of the old, puri-
fied the avenues to Public Life, paved the dirty
ways to Place and Power, debated and made
laws for the Common Good, and had no party but
their Country? I saw in them, the wheels that
move the meanest perversion of virtuous Political
Machinery that the worst tools ever wrought.—
Despicable trickery at elections; under-handed
tamperings with public officers; cowardly attacks
upon opponents, with scurrilous newspapers for
shields, and hired pens for daggers; shameful
	...
   That there are, among the Representatives of
the people in both Houses, and among all parties,
some men of high character and great abilities, I
need not say. The foremost among those politi-
cians who are known in Europe, have been already
described, and I see no reason to depart from the
rule I have laid down for my guidance, of abstain-
ing from all mention of individuals. It will be

   Towards Slavery Mr. D<small>ICKENS</small> entertains no
very decided affection; nor could any reasonable
man expect that he should. He might have men-
tioned, however, that the system was entailed
upon the Southern States by England—that it was
sustained and nursed into life by her, and that
for all its enormities, for its very existence,
we are indebted to her 'motherly' care. Nor
does he seem to understand that, had it not been
for the wild efforts of his countrymen, founded
quite as much in patriotic hatred of America as in
love for humanity, tending solely to inflame and alarm
those upon whom they sought to operate, many of
its harshest features would long since have been
destroyed. We presume it is difficult for an Eng-
lishman to feel this truth; it is certainly next to
impossible for the best of them to acknowledge it.
His strictures upon the Press, strange as it may
seem for us to say so, are <i>essentially true</i>. The
Newspaper Press of this country delights to dwell
upon the might of its influence—the absolute om-
nipotence of its sway; nor is exaggeration easy.
The power of the Press here is as great as the
Press itself represents it. But no man seems to
understand, or willing to acknowledge, that its
power for <i>evil</i> is infinitely greater than its power
for <i>good</i>. Where one heart will receive an im-
pulse in favor of truth and goodness and purity
by the most eloquent appeal in their behalf, in a
hundred a single sentence of ribald slander, a soli-
tary paragraph of unprincipled licentiousness,
plants seeds which will bear fruit through the
countless ages of eternity. It is utterly impossi-
ble for any man to exaggerate, or paint in colors
more vivid than the truth, the pestiferous power
of a single press which sets all moral principle
at defiance, and marches on, with unblushing
front, to its work of death. The guilt of murder
is perfect innocence compared with that of those
who direct these great engines of misery and sin.
How could an intelligent foreigner come among
us and open his eyes upon any thing else than
these infamous sheets? From one end of the
year to the other—at every hour of every day—
they are cried in our ears, and their pestilent rot-
tenness pollutes every breath of air we inhale.—
How does it mend the mater to say that they are
conducted by foreigners? W<small>HO SUPPORTS THEM</small>
—and why are not these 'foreigners' themselves
<i>thrust into the dungeons</i> they have helped to fill,
or <i>banished</i> from the land they have blasted and
cursed? It is folly, it is cowardice, it is crime,
to seek to shift upon others the responsibility we
have ourselves incurred. Manliness and honesty
would seek a remedy for the foul plague, instead
of cloaking it with lies and hiding its deformity
from themselves and the world. While we see,
and know, and most deeply <i>feel</i>, these things to
be so, how shall we blame any man for telling the
truth?
   Two things in this work will strike two classes
of persons unpleasantly: the first is the frequency
and apparent <i>gusto</i> with which Boz alludes to
'brandy and water'—and the very unbecoming tone
in which he speaks of what are termed the 'ortho-
dox' professors of religion. To say nothing of
their relation to truth and morality, both these
features of the book are decidedly vulgar and un-
worthy the author, who thus sinks himself much
more nearly to a level with Capt. M<small>ARRYAT</small> than
would please his best and warmest friends. He
speaks with great contempt of Temperance Hotels,
Temperance Societies and the principled hostility
to theatres and kindred amusements which char-
acterizes the religious community especially of
New-England.
   As a literary performance the 'Notes' do not
claim, or reach, any high degree of merit. The
<d>[Col.4]</d>
chapters are hastily and carelessly written, and
contain manifest faults of style and taste. But the
genius of D<small>ICKENS</small> shines through them all, and
they are full of the beauty, the easy power and the
genial humanity which have made his previous
works beloved by all the world. He has caught
and portrayed, with a vivid truth none of his pre-
decessors have equaled, the prominent points of
American character—its virtues and its faults, its
strength and its weakness; and he shows himself
as keenly alive to the former as to the latter. He
has proved himself more truly our friend than
those who preceded him in the path he pursued.
If the vanity and conceit of our sensitive people do
not blind them to the truth, they cannot fail to
profit by his kind and well-founded censure. No
man in his senses can for a moment suppose that
we are destitute of faults—or that others will not
see them; and before we denounce those who
come among us for venturing to speak of them
above their breath, we should call to mind the
treatment England has uniformly received from
American book-makers who have traveled within
her borders. There is far more illiberality, un-
founded prejudice, and uncharitable judgement in
a single chapter of L<small>ESTER</small>'s 'Glory and Shame
of England' than in all that D<small>ICKENS</small> has written
concerning us; and we should do well to call to
mind the shouts of patriotic and national applause
with which his book was hailed upon its first ap-
pearance—though we rejoice to say that reflection
brought saner thoughts and more just judgement to
our people.
   We have little doubt that newspaper critics
throughout the country will deem it not only a
duty, but a high privilege, to abuse this book with-
out stint or measure; but from those who read it
attentively, not for the bare purpose of finding fault
with its statements or carping at its tone, we be-
lieve it will meet a far different reception. Its pre-
vailing spirit is one of kindness, of friendly regard,
of warm sympathy, with all that is excellent in our
character and institutions—and of boldness and
freedom towards what, beyond all doubt, must be
esteemed our faults. We feel quite sure that this
spirit will be met with a feeling of liberality—and
of gratitude, not less for his approval than his cen-
sure; for both are founded alike upon a clear and
discriminating estimate of our merits and our faults.
His closing words indicate the prevailing spirit of
the work, and speak at once the noble feeling of
the author, and the estimate which every consider-
ate man will put upon its worth:
<l9>   “<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=onI-WL7FpTAC&pg=PA92">It is enough for me</a>, to know, that what I have
set down in these pages, cannot cost me a single
friend on the other side of the Atlantic, who is, in
anything, deserving of the name. For the rest, I
put my trust, implicitly, in the spirit in which they
have been conceived and penned; and I can bide
my time. I have made no reference to my recep-
tion, nor have I suffered it to influence me in what
I have written; for in either case, I should have
offered but a sorry acknowledgement, compared
with that I bear within my breast, towards those
partial readers of my former books, across the Wa-
ter, who met me with an open hand, and not with
one that closed upon an iron muzzle.”</l9>

Hasty was present when the box containing the

		THE ASYLUM JOURNAL.
   Our Village has witnessed the past week the ap-
pearance of a new publication under the above title,
and we ascertain by a perusal of it that it is to be
printed and edited by the inmates of the Asylum.
Judging from the first number, it will undoubtedly
not only be a valuable means of imparting informa-
tion relative to the many forms of the disease of in-
sanity, and the various modes of treatment through
the world, but will afford a channel of relief to the
teeming minds that are now suffering from its fearful
visitations. It is asserted by medical authors that
this disease so far from paralyzing or enervating the
mental power, not unfrequently invigorates and
adds brilliancy to the exercise of them; and that a
peculiar fineness of sensibility, almost inseparable
from disease, is the most essential constituent of
Genius. If such be the fact, (and who that has
searched the records of the infirmities of Genius
can doubt it?) we may expect from the Asylum
Journal such emanations as will not merely gratify
an idle curiosity, but regale the intellect, enlist the
best sympathies of our nature, and illustrate the
fact, that where our Heavenly Parent administers
painful discipline, he accompanies the affliction
with more alleviating compensations than we are
led to imagine from a careless survey of the evils
of society.
   We trust this interesting paper may be encourag-
ed by the liberality of our citizens, for we feel the
Hospital to be a benefit to the Village in more ways
than one; as it not only affords us the <i>immediate</i>
means of alleviating a fearful disease, but it provides
a market for much of the substance that might oth-
erwise remain unconsumed. Its humane Physi-
cian is devoting all his energies to its firm estab-
lishment and just administration, and surely when
opportunity occurs, we as a people ought to contri-
bute our portion to the same object, either by kind
effort or liberal subscription. We can give the pa-
per a wide circulation, and the proceeds over and
above the expenses of printing will be devoted to
those of the inmates who are suffering under the
double pressure of poverty and disease. Here, then
we have an opportunity, and by a very trifling ef-
fort, hardly worth the name, of evincing our personal
gratitude for the gift of reason, and our willingness to
alleviate the misfortunes of those who are deprived
of it in imitation of Him who said “All things what-
soever ye would that men should do unto you—do
ye even so to them.”

   <i>Case of John C. Colt</i>.—An application to
the Chancellor, by the counsel of this un-
happy man, for the allowance of a writ of
error, has been denied—as a similar appli-
cation had previously been by the Circuit
Judge and the Supreme Court. The alleged
errors were that Aldermen had no right to
sit as judges of the Court of Oyer and Ter-
miner, and that the Circuit Judge erred in
his decision relative to the <u title="empanelling">empannelling</u> of
the jury, and also erred in excluding testi-
mony of the good character of Caroline
Henshaw, and in admitting testimony tend-
ing to show that Adams might have been
killed by a pistol shot. It was also contend-
ed that the Court of Errors were bound to
weigh the evidence in the case and decide
whether it was sufficient to sustain the ver-
dict.
   The Chancellor held that there was noth-
ing in either of these exceptions, and refused
to allow the writ. The case, therefore, can-
not go before the Court of Errors, and on
the 18th of this month, Colt must die, unless
the Executive shall think his crime a proper
one for commutation or pardon—of the lat-
ter of which, at least, we think, there is no
probability.—<i>N. Y. Com. Adv.</i>

   <i>Impeachment of Police Justices</i>.—Strange indeed
appears to us, the indifference manifested by the peo-
ple to the trial now going on in the County Court,
involving as it does, a question of gross miscon-
duct in a judicial officer, and a flagrant assault on
the elective franchise. The circumstances connected
with it too are such, as we might have supposed
would have excited the greatest interest. The jail
almost emptied of its inmates, before the sentence of
the law on them had taken full effect, these carried
thence on the eve of an election, stealthily by night
in boats, landed in the city, there supplied with lodg-
ing, food and drink—the latter to excess—and on the
following day made to vote the locofoco ticket, con-
taining on it, the names of some of those who were
cognizant of the alleged misdeeds. We say it is
strange, and we may add painful in the extreme, to
witness the apparent apathy with which a proceed-
ing, so pregnant with results bearing on the very
foundation on which our political institutions mainly
repose, is regarded.
   But the strangest of all, on this occasion, is the
conduct of the Mayor of the City, he, who above all
others should exhibit the greatest solicitude to bring
the perpetrators of crimes, such as those in question,
to punishment. At least we might expect from him
the impartiality of a Judge, instead of which we see
him acting the part of a paid advocate of the accused.
There is not a technical objection urged in his favor,
that the Mayor does not support by his voice and
vote. Every impediment that can be thrown in the
way of a fair enquiry, meets his support and encour-
agement. It may be, that this is the way to gather
laurels at the hands of his party, but we cannot
bring ourselves to believe, it will meet with the other,
than the severest condemnation, at the hands of the
people.

<l9>			COUNTY COURT.
		Chief Judge Ulshoeffer presiding.
   <i>Trial of Justice Miln Parker continued</i>—The roll
having been called, this case was proceeded with by
the examination of Peter Collins, another of the dis-
charged vagrants, who gave similar testimony to that
of the others, with the addition that 10 or 12 men
were turned out of bed in the hospital to be dischar-
ged, and one was so ill that he fell down and was put
to bed again and died the next day.
   Philip Mulkerrin, another discharged vagrant of-
fered his vote at the poll at the corner of James and
Water streets, in the 4th ward, but it was refused.
Doyle went with him to the poll and saw him offer
his vote. He saw two or three of those who come
off the island with him vote at the same poll. The
first he knew of his discharge was that Ruckles the
deputy keeper, sent for him and told him to go and
get his clothes and be ready to go with the others.
That was between three and four o'clock in the after-
noon of the 11th April.
   Peter Adams, also one of the vagrants, applied for
his discharge to M. Gallagher two or three times in
the latter end of March, and about 7 or 8 days before
the election he saw Mr. Ruckles and went to him and
asked him if he could get his discharge, and he told
him he would see about it. The next he heard about
it was Mr. Ruckles sent his runner to say Ruckles
and two gentlemen wanted to see him. He went,
and Ruckles told him that perhaps those two gentle-
men could get him his discharge, and they took him
into a room and shut the door, and asked him if he
voted the democratic ticket, and he told them that he
had in the 3d ward, when they said they wanted men
to vote in the 4th and 7th wards, and asked him how
many men he could get to vote in those wards, and
he told him he might 2, or 5, or 10, or 15, or per-
haps 20—he could not tell how many. They said if
he would do so they would get his discharge, and
that of those who might agree to vote as they wished
and he was to go among the men and talk to them,
but must not get more than two or three or so at a
time, as it would look bad to apply at the police of-
fice for too many discharges at once. He went
among the men and got at first two names. He told
them they would get their discharges if they voted
the democratic ticket. The first he told, were na-
med McPeters and Slater, and he gave their names
to the two gentlemen who had asked him to get the
names. Altogether he got 14 persons with himself
whom he told if they voted the democratic ticket
they would be discharged. All the names but the
two first he gave to Ruckles two or three at a time.
They were all discharged with a lot more. This con-
versation took place about 8 days previous to the
election. He voted the democratic ticket. It had
the name of Mr. Morris on for Mayor. He voted in
the 4th ward. Culbertson went with him to vote
and voted after him.
   Andrew McPeters, another vagrant was one of
those who went to Tom Doyle's. He got drunk that
night and was drunk all the next day, so that he did
not know whether he voted or not. He first heard
of his discharge from the last witness, who said he
was sent to get the men for the election and they
were to be discharged. He was asked what ticket
he voted, and the witness said he would vote the
<i>Dimmikratick</i> ticket to get out. He was to vote in
the 4th and 7th Wards.

		<b>Review of the Week.</b>
   A<small>MERICAN</small> N<small>OTES FOR</small> G<small>ENERAL</small> C<small>IRCULATION</small>.
B<small>Y</small> C<small>HARLES</small> D<small>ICKENS</small>. 1 vol. New York: <i>Harper
& Brothers</i>.—A careful perusal of this book con-
firms the impression which all the previous works of
its author had left on our minds—that his heart is
ever open to sympathy with suffering, and bold to
resist oppression and cruelty; that he reverences hu-
manity, without reference to its clothing or social
position; and that he delights in smoothing what is
rugged, and cheering what is sad in the path of
life.
   His Notes on this country, hastily written, and
sometimes founded in misconception, are, never-
theless, such as, in the main, intelligent Ameri-
cans will confess to be just. He enters into no
long disquisitions on our laws or Constitution; nor
does he, in any instance, violate the decencies of
social life, by referring to individuals who received
and entertained him; but, in the <i>Boz</i> vein, takes
the reader out with him in his journeys and in his
city strolls, and thinks out aloud for and with him.
There is nothing very new, and no attempt at be-
ing very profound in his observations on American
habits, institutions, and character; but there is a
spirit of intelligence, of manliness, and fairness,
and a benevolent sympathy with the wants and suf-
ferings of the helpless and miserable, which will
commend the work to impartial readers, in spite of
the sharp truths mingled with the narrative.
   The faults of the book are in occasional strains
of exaggeration in the description of disagreeables,
which really almost disposes one to doubt of the
general truthfulness of the more sober parts. We
mention, as examples, the description of the state
room, and general accommodation of the Britannia
steamer, in which the passage out was made, that of
the motion of the vessel in a storm,—the stage-drive
from Fredericksburg to Richmond, and that from
Columbus to Tiffin—which are in the broadest vein
of caricature, though given as serious.
   We suppose most of our readers will possess
themselves of the work, which is a single volume,
and costs but one shilling, though published in Lon-
don in 2 volumes, for <u title="shillings ?"><b>ß</b></u>5,—and therefore shall make
only such extracts as may afford us some special
cause for remark.
   We take first the trip to Lowell:
<l9>   <i>Visit to Lowell</i>.—I happened to arrive at the first
factory just as the dinner hour was over, and the girls
were returning to their work; indeed the stairs of
the mill were thronged with them as I ascended.
	...</l9>
<d>[Col.2]</d>
	...
   The next extract is nearer home, and refers to
the prison of detention of this city, commonly known
as the Tombs. See how the system there pursued
affected a benevolent stranger:
<l9>   <i>The Tombs</i>.—What is this dismal-fronted pile of
bastard Egyptian, like an enchanter's palace in a me-
lo-drama!—a famous prison, called the Tombs.—
	...</l9>
<d>[Col.3]</d>
	...
   The readers of this paper, may remember that not
many months ago, we commented upon the case of
a poor woman, tossed into one of these horrid cells,
on suspicion of being intoxicated, left there alone,
and unvisited during the night, and in the morning
found dead! Yet no inquiry was ever instituted,
and the same thing may happen any other night.
Surely, surely, this should be cared for.
   There are many other passages we had marked as
texts for comment, but find the space we can afford,
already filled, we must therefore close here for the
present—with the purpose possibly, of making a se-
cond notice of this very readable book.

   T<small>HE</small> S<small>ENTENCE OF</small> C<small>OLT</small>.—The opinion of Gov-
ernor S<small>EWARD</small>, which we publish this day, re-
fusing to commute or in any way disturb the
sentence of Colt, was communicated to the
wretched prisoner yesterday morning. He re-
ceived it at first with apparent coolness and un-
concern; but when he saw his fate was sealed be-
yond all possibility of change, all the audacious
boldness which has marked his bearing since the
day of the commission of his crime, gave way, and
he seemed overcome with grief and dejection. He
sent for his brother who remained with him
through the afternoon; he also desired the atten-
dance of a clergyman. During the first few hours
he wept much, but this emotion afterward gave
way, we learn, to an appearance of wildness bor-
dering on insanity. To prevent his self-destruc-
tion he will be kept shackled until the day of his
execution; and no one will be admitted to see him
except in presence of the Keeper of the Prison.

<d>[Col.3]</d>
		<b>John C. Colt's Case.</b>
   The following is a copy of Governor S<small>EWARD'S</small>
O<small>PINION</small> in the case of J<small>OHN</small> C. C<small>OLT</small>, who was
sentenced to be executed on the 18th November,
instant, for the murder of Samuel Adams:
<m9>				A<small>LBANY</small>, November 11th, 1842.
   John C. Colt was convicted on the 27th day of September
last, at a Court of Oyer and Terminer in the city of New
York, on an indictment for murder, and was sentenced to
suffer death on the eighteenth day of the present month.—
The trial was humanely conducted. Peculiar advantages
of defence were allowed. Every objection raised by the
counsel was deliberately considered; the charge of the
court manifested unusual tenderness towards the accused;
and the jury examined the evidence with extraordinary
patience and attention.
   When the verdict had been rendered, an application for a
new trial on the grounds of alleged prejudice by a juror,
improper conduct by the jury, and other supposed irregu-
larities, was considered by the court of Oyer and Terminer
and justly denied. The presiding judge then allowed a
writ of error, by which the cause was removed to the Sup-
reme Court, and in the mean time the sentence consequent
on the verdict was delayed. That tribunal reviewed and
affirmed all the decisions of the Court of Oyer and Terminer,
which court then performed its remaining duty by render-
ing final judgment. The accused then again demanded a
writ of error, with a view to obtain a reconsideration by the
Supreme Court, and in the event of an adverse adjudication,
then to remove the record for revision to the Court for the
Correction of Errors. Such a writ could only be allowed
by a Circuit Judge, a Justice of the Supreme Court or the
Chancellor. The Circuit Judge who tried the cause; the
Chancellor, and one of the Justices of the Supreme Court,
with the concurrence of his associates, have severally refus-
ed to allow a writ of error, and the accused now appeals to
the Executive authority for its interposition.
   The application is urged with a degree of earnestness and
sustained by an array of influence, unusual even on such
occasions, which never fail to awaken the apprehensions
of the conscientious and the sympathies of the humane.
   The subject is supposed to involve the following in-
quiries:
   1st. Whether any error in law has occurred in the trial
and conviction.
   2dly. Whether the conviction was contrary to evidence.
   3dly. Whether the prisoner is a proper subject for cle-
mency.
   In regard to the first of these questions, the Governor is
by no means prepared to say that he is not bound to abide
by the decision of the Supreme Court. It is the right of
that tribunal to expound the laws, and their expositions are
conclusive upon every other department of Government
until overruled by higher judicial authority. The Govern-
or does not constitute an appellate tribunal to review
the proceedings, correct the errors, and reverse or
modify the judgments of courts of either civil or criminal
jurisdiction. Nevertheless, the pardoning power might
properly be exercised to save a convicted person from the
consequences of a privation of any legal right or form of
defence resulting either from accident or neglect, preju-
dice or misconduct from judicial officers. The accused
complains that a writ of error has been unjustly denied, and
it therefore becomes necessary to examine the grounds on
which it was demanded.
   When proceeding to the trial, the Court of Oyer and Ter-
miner discovered that there was a deficiency of unbiased
jurors, and thereupon ordered that three hundred persons
should be summoned. After the order had been executed,
the accused applied for a list of the three hundred persons,
and also to be allowed two or three days to make inquiries
concerning them. The request was denied. The Govern-
or is not aware that any statute, rule or custom of courts of
justice was violated by the decision.
   The accused then challenged the panel of three hundred
persons on several grounds, all of which were overruled
by the Court, to wit: First—<i>Because the number was too
large</i>. But it was within the discretion of the Court to de-
termine how many should be summoned, and the result
showed that the number selected was not large enough.
Secondly—<i>Because only two days were allowed the Sheriff to
execute the order</i>. It was nevertheless executed. Thirdly—
<i>Because the Sheriff had not furnished the counsel for the ac-
cused with a copy of the list</i>. No such duty was enjoined
on that officer. Fourthly—<i>Because the Sheriff selected the
three hundred persons by taking their names from the roll of
grand and petit jurors of the city and county of New-York</i>.
But the Sheriff was not forbidden by law to choose the
three hundred persons in that manner, and there would
have been just ground of complaint if he had summoned
persons not legally ascertained to be jurors.
   The accused next insists that the ballots for the 45 persons
on the original panel should be drawn and exhausted before
those containing the names of the 300, subsequently sum-
moned, should be put into the box. But the Court directed
otherwise. After drawing all the ballots there was a defi-
ciency of one juror; and when a further person was sum-
moned, the accused required that a ballot containing that
person's name should be put into the box with those of the
45 first summoned who had not appeared when called.
The Court overruled the request. The person so last sum-
moned was found not impartial and was set aside. The
accused then insisted that those among the 45 first sum-
moned who had not appeared should be again called, but
the Court awarded an order to summon another person,
and the individual then summoned, being found impartial,
was received as a juror. No irregularity occurred in these
proceedings.
   A trunk, proved to have been found in the dwelling
of the prisoner, and in which a watch belonging to
the deceased had been discovered, was produced. The
Court overruled an objection, and admitted testimony to
prove the contents of the trunk. The decision seems to
have been reasonable, and in harmony with the rules of ev-
idence.
   It was proved that all the wounds on the person of the
deceased, except one, might have been made with a hatch-
et. The Court admitted testimony designed to show that
the one would might have been effected by the discharge
of a pistol. One count in the indictment charged that death
was produced with a hatchet; another charged that it was
inflicted with some unknown instrument. The evidence,
even if inadmissible under the first count, was unquestiona-
bly proper under the last count.
   The remains of the deceased having been exhumed dur-
ing the trial, the head was produced in Court with a view
to enable the jury to apply the testimony with greater cer-
tainty. The proceeding, although deemed erroneous by
the accused, was necessary and proper, and sanctioned by
the law of evidence.
   Caroline M. Henshaw, a witness for the accused, during
her direct examination testified that she cohabited with
him, and he thereupon offered to prove her good charac-
ter for veracity, so as to rebut an adverse presumption sup-
posed to result from the fact thus disclosed. The District
Attorney objected, but at the same time admitted that the
witness had given her evidence with an intention to testify
only the truth. The Court, thereupon, very properly de-
clined to receive unnecessary evidence of the veracity of a
witness who had not been impeached by the prosecution,
and whose truthfulness had been conceded.
   The 4th Section of Article 1, Title 2, Chapter 1, Part 4
of the Revised Statutes, if in the following words;
   “<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=c0owAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA550">Such homicide is excusable when committed,</a>
   “1. By accident and misfortune, in lawfully correcting a
“child or servant; or in doing any other lawful act by law-
“ful means, with usual and ordinary caution, and without
“any unlawful intent; or
   “2. By accident and misfortune, in the heat of passion,
“upon any sudden and sufficient provocation, or upon a
“sudden combat, without any undue advantage being
“taken, and without any dangerous weapon being used,
“and not done in a cruel or unusual manner.”
   The accused objected to the charge of the Court because
the Judge did not instruct the Jury that the words “<i>By ac-
cident and misfortune</i>,” in the second subdivision of the sec-
tion, were to be rejected as surplusage. But no authority
is found for rejecting the words thus <u>alledged</u> to be neces-
sary.
   The Court also charged that if the Jury believed under
the evidence that the homicide was effected in a cruel and
unusual manner, the case would not fall within the last sub-
division of the section. This portion of the charge was con-
sidered erroneous by the accused, but it seems to have been
in harmony with the spirit as well as the letter of the law.
   The Court also charged the Jury that a homicide, to be
<i>excusable</i>, must be committed without a design to effect
death. The counsel for the accused questioned this posi-
tion. But the law declares that homicide can only be ex-
cusable when it happens <i>by accident and misfortune</i>, and it
cannot so happen if it proceed from <i>design</i>.
   The ground upon which the accused demanded a writ of
error was that several decisions of the Court of Oyer and
Terminer which have been noticed were erroneous. But
he was allowed to present them for the consideration of
the Supreme Court, and they were solemnly considered and
affirmed by that tribunal before the judgement was ren-
dered against the prisoner by the Court of Oyer and Ter-
miner. The Governor not only concurs with the Court of
Oyer and Terminer and with the Supreme Court in the
opinion that the objections raised by the accused were un-
tenable, but he sees no reason to distrust the absolute confi-
dence in the correctness of that decision manifested by the
Circuit Judge, the Chancellor and the Justices of the Su-
preme Court in their refusal to allow a second writ of error.
Therefore the denial of this writ thus demanded does not
seem such a hardship toward the accused as would call for
redress by the exercise of executive power.
   After the cause had been adjudicated by the Supreme
Court and sentence had been pronounced in the Court of
Oyer and Terminer, the accused for the first time assumed
the ground that the two Aldermen who were associated with
the Circuit Judge on the trial were not Judges, because the
laws by virtue of which they acted in that capacity conflict-
ed with the Constitution. That instrument contains a pro-
vision declaring that all judicial officers (with an exception
which has no application to the present question) shall be
appointed by the Governor and Senate. Aldermen are not
so appointed, but are elected by the People. But Alder-
men in the city of New-York have always been recognized
by law as Judges. They were acting as such when the
Constitution came into existence, and since that period their
judicial powers have been confirmed by many statutes.—
The Supreme Court has heretofore decided that those stat-
utes were constitutional; that the Aldermen were Judges
<i>de jure</i>, and that even if they were not Judges <i>de jure</i>, they
were Judges <i>de facto</i>; that their proceedings were valid
until the Aldermen should be removed from the bench by
the judgement of a competent tribunal, and that their judi-
cial powers could not be questioned in collateral prosecu-
tions in which they were not parties. Whatever opinion
the Governor might entertain concerning this decision, he
is bound to acquiesce. He has no power either to oblige
the Supreme Court to reconsider the question or to submit
it for the examination of the Court for the Correction of Er-
rors. Under such circumstances, to grant a pardon to the
prisoner on the ground of the incompetency of his Judges
would be an acknowledgement that every judgement ren-
dered by any Court of Oyer and Terminer in the city of New-
York since the constitution was established with one exception,
was not merely erroneous, but void, and would draw after
it an obligation to pardon all persons who have been, as
well as all who may hereafter be, convicted of crimes in
those courts—the chief tribunals of criminal jurisdiction in
the metropolis. In adopting such a course, the Governor
would necessarily appear in an attitude of resistance to the
laws and defiance of the courts instead of performing his
proper office of executing the laws as expounded by the Ju-
diciary; and the pardoning power, granted only for occa-
sional purposes of justice and humanity, would thus be per-
verted and made an agent of disorder and revolution.
   Was the conviction contrary to the evidence? This im-
portant question has not been and could not be in any form
submitted to the Supreme Court or to the Court for the
Correction of Errors, because in every criminal case, the
Jury have an exclusive right to pass upon the facts submit-
ted to them. Their verdict cannot be reviewed by any
legal tribunal, and the right of the Governor to examine it
is only incidental to the pardoning power.
   Samuel Adams resided in New-York; was about the
age of thirty years, in active business as a printer of books,
and extensively known. He disappeared on Friday the
17th of September, 1841. Inquiries concerning him were
published on the next Wednesday, and on Sunday the 26th,
his remains were found in a rude box, such as is used for</m9>
<d>[Col.4]</d>
<m9>transporting merchandize, in the hold of a vessel about to
sail for New Orleans. The proof on the trial left no doubt
	...
Each of the wounds would have been mortal, and which
ever of them was first inflicted, must have instantly de-
prived the deceased of consciousness and of all power of
resistance.
   Such a homicide could not have been accidental or ne-
cessary for self-defence. It was committed with a deadly
weapon, in a cruel and inhuman manner, upon a defence-
less, powerless man. Reason and law agree that the homi-
cide could not have been innocent, justifiable or excusable.

<d>[Col.5]</d>
<m9>their instructions to set down the whole truth. Yet while
it purports to give an account of an affray following re-
proachful words, it does not state which of the parties used
the words. It states that mutual blows were given before
the prisoner seized the hatchet, but does not inform us how
many blows, nor describe any of them, except one received
by himself more severe than the others, and which he re-
turned with violence. It states that the parties grappled
and he was pushed against the wall while the deceased was
twisting the prisoner's <u title="neckcloth">neckloth</u>, and then the prisoner
seized the hatchet and inflicted one blow—then lost all pow-
er of reason by strangulation, and remembered nothing far-
ther distinctly or coherently until afterward, when he was
roused by a knocking at the door. Since his conviction the
prisoner has submitted a series of letters written by himself
to various friends during his imprisonment. In one of the
letters written after the trial, he says that he did but de-
fend himself against a wanton, vile and unpardonable attack.
That he asked the deceased to be just, who thereupon ac-
cused him of injustice. For calm words, the deceased gave
him insulting language. His peremptory denial was re-
turned by the deceased with blows. In a subsequent letter
he excused himself by haste and want of consideration for
having set down in the statement produced on the trial, that
“he was obliged to stand on the knees of Adams, to crowd
him into the box;” says that the first part of the statement
was quite imperfect, and did not convey the whole truth;
admits that he retorted language of unmeasured reproach,
and gives farther details, so important, if true, that they
could not have been forgotten when preparing his previous
statement; and which cannot now be admitted as true, be-
cause they were not made known by him until that state-
ment had proved insufficient for his defence.*
   The letters of the prisoner furnish other reasons to dis-
trust his veracity. To receive such an ex parte statement,
and permit speculation based upon it to overthrow a ver-
dict, would be subversive of the administration of justice.

inflicted. Penitence and resolutions to amend are indispen-
sable, among other conditions, of pardon. No such condi-
tions are offered in the present case. The prisoner has for-
gotten his victim, heaped insult upon his humbled and be-
reaved family, defied the Court, denounced the Jury and
presented himself before the Executive as an injured, not
as a penitent man.
   In making known to the prisoner that the expectation of
pardon, the last hope of life, must be relinquished, the Gov-
ernor cannot forbear from expressing an earnest wish that
the few days which yet remain to the prisoner may be
spent in preparing to appear before that <u title="dreadful (elsewhere)">dread</u> tribunal ap-
pointed for all men, before which none can offer any other
justification than sincere repentance for every error and
humble yet confiding faith in the R<small>EDEEMER OF</small> M<small>ANKIND</small>.

   * Extract from John C. Colt's letter dated February 15th,
1842: “He almost instantly seized hold of my neckcloth,
which placed me in his power—pressing me to the table
and wall, he struck me three or four times in the breast, and
seized me <i>per privas partes</i>. Every thing seemed to turn
black. I was in agony, and exerting myself for relief, how
I know not. The last distinct recollection I have, before I
was relieved by his fall, was, that of trying to press him off
with my left hand, as I held on his collar, endeavoring with
my right hand, at the same time to raise myself from the
table, as he had me pressed over backwards upon it. It
was in this painful position that I seized that accursed
hatchet and gave him the unfortunate blows that I did.—
When relieved from his horrid grasp, I beheld for the first
time my awful defence. Heaven only knows the number
of blows I struck him. There may have been four or five.
And when I reflect upon the instrument most unfortunately
seized and instantaneously used, it is only to be wondered
that his head not dashed into a thousand pieces.
   † Extract of John C. Colt's letter dated March 8, 1842:—
“My counsel considered my case a perfectly clear one and
believed that I should be acquitted. To produce this result
they conceived that the evidence of Adams' coming to my
office in bad blood, and evidence of the scuffle, and the
evidence of his account being wrong, was quite sufficient
when taking into consideration the fact that this unfortunate
man had before, in several instances, shown himself a
kind of dare-dog and had been consequently turned from
the houses of several citizens for abusive and insulting lan-
guage. Had this not have been the conclusion I could ea-
sily have slipped through the fingers of the law. The body
of that unfortunate, foolish man was never identified, and
the only positive evidence connecting me with the box con-
taining it, was the drayman's. He swore that I was the
man that delivered it to him, consequently it was alone ne-
cessary to prove that I was not about the granite building
that morning, to have been acquitted. But I should forever
despise myself for slipping through the fingers of the law
by such means.”</m9>

<d>[Col.1]</d>
   <i>The case of John C. Colt</i>.—More than an ordinary
degree of interest has been felt by our fellow-citizens
during the past week, to know the result of an ap-
plication to the Executive for the pardon of C<small>OLT</small>,
the convicted murderer of A<small>DAMS</small>, sentenced to be
executed on Friday next.
   We have never entertained a doubt of the justice
of the verdict rendered by the Jury in this case; al-
though we certainly supposed it quite possible that
the very general feeling of the <i>Bar</i> in relation to the
technicalities of the law, might find sympathy in the
breast of the Executive, himself a lawyer. Such how-
ever, it appears from the able and conclusive docu-
ment which we publish this morning, has not been
the case; and C<small>OLT</small> is accordingly apprised that the
sentence of the Law will certainly be executed upon
him at the time designated.
   While we deeply sympathise with the respectable
friends and relatives upon whom this blow will fall
far heavier than upon the criminal himself, and kind
feelings towards whom, have induced us to observe a
studied silence upon the disastrous consequences to
the administration of justice which would have
grown out of his pardon—we must now be permitted
to remark, that the determination of the Governor is
entirely in harmony with public sentiment, and in our
opinion, all-important for the preservation of that re-
spect for the laws which can alone render society se-
cure in the enjoyment of life and property.
   We cannot imagine a more delicate or difficult po-
sition for a man of feeling and a just sense of his re-
ligious and legal responsibilities to be placed in, than
that recently occupied by Governor S<small>EWARD</small>; and
for the fearless and honest discharge of his high and
imperative duty under such circumstances, he is, most
assuredly, entitled to the thanks of all our well dis-
posed and orderly citizens, at the same time that his
motives cannot fail to command the respect of those
who with equally good and pure motives, sought
the interposition of Executive clemency.
   We commend this document to the impartial consi-
deration of all our fellow citizens in every condition of
life, as one honorable alike to the head and the heart
of the writer, and at the same time invaluable to the
cause of law and order in this metropolis, doomed as
it is, to be the refuge of the lawless and unprincipled
from every quarter of the civilized world. No indi-
vidual can rise from a careful perusal of it, without
feeling that the writer has had much to struggle with
in resisting the importunity of friends based upon ap-
parent sound legal claims for a pardon, and backed
by appeals and solicitations which found a ready res-
ponse in his own bosom; but over all which he has
nobly triumphed, because it was right to do, and
because his duties as the Chief Magistrate of the
State, were, in his estimation, paramount to the
claims of private friendship and the pleadings of his
own feelings in behalf of the life of a fellow-being.
   This is probably the last official document which
will issue from the pen of W<small>ILLIAM</small> H. S<small>EWARD</small>, du-
ring the brief period remaining for the exercise of his
official duties; but it is one which adds another leaf
to that civic wreath which four years of faithful and
incessant labour in the service of the state, has secu-
red him, and during which period he has won for
himself a reputation for honesty and abilities of which
even a C<small>LINTON</small> might have been proud, and which
is the more to be appreciated, because freely accord-
ed by men of all parties in every section of our wide-
ly extended country.

   Michael Dollard left in a boat which was under the
charge of Ruckles and Bogert, two of the Deputy
Keepers. They crossed the ferry and got into an
omnibus, stopping and getting out to get some drink
before they got to the end of their journey—at the
Watch-house. Bogert took them from the Watch-
house to a house in Hammersley-street, where they
had crackers and cheese, and drink.
   The next morning they went to another place and
had breakfast, being taken by a man named Preston.
Some then went to vote and some went away. The
witness did not vote. He told Ruckles he had not
been long enough in the state though he had been
in the country, and Ruckles replied that if he had a
vote he had a right to vote somewhere.
   Patrick Butler left the Island on the night of the
11th April, and was taken to Cherry street and
furnished with food, drink and lodging. Did not
vote, as he is not a citizen.

   C<small>OLT'S</small> F<small>ATE</small> S<small>EALED</small>.—All hope for a melio-

nounced against the unfortunate John C. Colt, has
vanished, and he has now no alternative left him
but to resign himself composedly to the embrace
of death, to which on Friday next he must inevi-

sentence of the law, and its execution; and the
hopes entertained by many, and the expectations
of many more, that the exertions which had been
made to obtain an interposition of the execu-

   T<small>HE</small> R<small>EFUSAL OF THE</small> E<small>XECUTIVE</small> to exercise
his pardoning prerogative in the case of Colt, ap-
pears to have excited some little degree of sur-
prise in the minds of a portion of the community.
   It is a principle acknowledged by all, friends as
well foes of capital punishment, that if a shade
of doubt exists of the guilt of a prisoner, his life
should not be taken. This is a feeling implanted
in the breast of every human being, and is one
which does honor to our natures; for <i>life</i> is pre-
cious—precious indeed—and when once taken can
never be restored.
   For our own part, we have no disposition to
censure either judges or jury in the case of Colt.
We believe they acted honestly and conscien-
tiously, and that any attempt to cast odium upon
them is unjust and improper; but the perusal of a
document to be found in another column of our
paper, has strengthened us in the opinion that a
new trial ought to have been granted, and from
what we have seen and heard within the past
few weeks, we believe that a great portion of our
citizens are of the same opinion.

<m9><s>?????????????????????????????????????????????</s>
Adams, during the rencontre <s>??????????????????????</s>
the latter, the undersigned giv<s>???????????????????</s>
which he has arrived, and the facts, exp<s>????????? rea-</s>
sonings by which he has arrived at such conclu<s>sions.</s>
   I. Adams was in an erect position at the time the fatal
blows were inflicted.
   Proof 1. Blood was found on the wall in large spots and
greater abundance at the height of a man's head than else-
where. See testimony of Justice Taylor and Doctor Chil-
ton.
   Proof 2. After the fall of Adams no blow was inflicted.
“About a quarter past 3,” says Asa H. Wheeler (See Bill
of Exceptions) “I heard a noise in the adjoining room
which sounded like the clashing of foils. This was but
momentary. It was followed by a fall on the floor of some-
thing quite heavy. I immediately left my seat, opened the
door, went into the hall to Mr. Colt's door, and listened—
all was still.” Close attention was paid to Colt's room for
many hours after the fall, and not a sound was heard.
   II. One of the parties at least must have firmly grappled
the other while the blows were inflicted.
   Proof. Several blows were received by Adams, any one
of which would have felled him if unsupported—yet he
did not fall till after the infliction of all the blows.
   III. All the blows were inflicted without material
change of position.
   This proposition results from the last, namely that one
of the parties at least firmly grappled the other when the
blows were inflicted. It is strongly supported too by the
facts to which I shall shortly allude.
   IV. There is nothing in the form of the fractures that
gives probability to the notion that any <u>other other</u> weapon
was used by Colt than the hatchet produced at the trial.
   Proof. To this proposition no objection has or can be
raised, except that which arises from the form of the frac-
ture on the left side of the head—to this fracture therefore
we will confine our attention.
   “On the left side of the head, posterior to the ear,” says
Dr. Gilman, (See <u>Bill Exceptions</u>) “there was a small round
hole that you could thrust you fore finger into without
any fissure or cracks. All the injuries about the head might
have been inflicted by such a hatchet except the small
round hole. I confess I cannot see how that wound could
be made with such an instrument, it might however, possi-
bly, by striking obliquely. I stated on my examination be-
fore the coroner's jury that this fracture looked as if it had
been made with a ball.”
   Dr. Kissam said in relation to this fracture, “I don't
know whether the small round hole could have been made
with the hatchet. It was more likely to have been made
with a nail. I have never seen a wound in a skull from a
ball, but I think the edges of the hole were too rough for
a ball to have made it. The back of the hatchet striking
obliquely might, I think, have produced the small hole.—
The skull there is quite thin.”
   Dr. Archer said “I think it very unlikely that a blow
with an instrument like the hatchet would have produced
such a round hole as that on the left side of the head—I
do not mean to say that such a hole might not have been
produced by the hatchet, but I think it very unlikely.”
   Owing to the difficulties felt by the Court in relation to
this fracture, the body of Adams was exhumed and the
skull examined, after which Dr. Gilman testified as fol-
lows:—
   “My opinion has been changed by the examination this
afternoon as to the hole being made by a ball.”
   The undersigned examined the skull, and have not the
slightest doubt that the hole on the left side of the head
was made by the posterior or inner corner of the edge of
the hatchet. He put that part of the hatchet to the frac-
ture, and it fitted exactly. The anterior part of the frac-
ture bearing the impression of the thick posterior edge of
the hatchet, the upper line of the fracture being a straight
cut edge, the posterior part of the fracture corresponding
with the sharp edge of a hatchet, and the inferior part be-
ing a rough broken surface. This exact correspondence
he exhibited to the court and jury. Dr. Mott was equally
positive in regard to this. “I have examined the skull in
connection with the hatchet,” says he; “and it is clear to
me that the small hole was made with the hatchet. I have
tried the hatchet into the hole, and it fits it.” This posi-
tive testimony must, it appears to me, set this question en-
tirely at rest, and remove all doubts as to the correctness of
our fourth conclusion. The weapon produced at the trial,
it may be remarked was both a hatchet and a hammer, be-
ing one of the description very commonly used in stores
and offices.
   V.—Colt and Adams were face to face at the time the
fatal blows were given.
   In considering this proposition, it will be necessary to
take into account the number, situation, form and direc-
tion of the fractures found on the skull of Adams.
   The fractures were five in number, one at the back of
the head, one on the left side of the head, one on the right
side of the head, and two on the forehead.
   1. That on the back part of the head was, as described
by Dr. Gilman, “a fracture of a peculiar character, on
what is called the occipital ridge, a piece was chipped
off.” This fracture was the least dangerous of those in-
flicted.
   2. The fracture on the left side we have already de-
scribed. Its situation is particularly noted by Dr. Kissam
as “above and behind the parietal protuberances,” those
projections of bone which are found on the side of the
head above the ear. The skull there is quite thin. The
direction of this fracture was slightly oblique from below,
upwards and backwards.
   3. The fracture on the right side of the head was, as is
described by Drs. Kissam and Gilman, near the posterior
parietal angle, that is, behind the upper part of the ear.
There was a fracture, “with depression, but not detach-
ment of the bone—the bone was broken and dented it, but
not detached. This fracture was quite small.” The un-
dersigned who examined the skull remarked that the ante-
rior superior part of the indentation was more deeply de-
pressed than the inferior posterior part.
   4 and 5. There were two severe fractures on the fore-
head one on the left, the other on the right side, in causing
which much more force was obviously employed than in
causing the others. The posterior and left fractures were
undoubtedly made by the cutting edge of the hatchet, the
right and two frontal fractures by the blunt end or a ham-
mer.
   In considering the various questions which have arisen
in the course of this part of the investigation, I have been
governed by the following general principles, namely:—
   That there is a discoverable relation between the form
of the weapon employed and the form of the wound inflic-
ted, and also between the position of the attacking party
and direction of his blows, and the situation and direction
of the wound, so that within certain narrow limits of un-
certainty, if the weapon—the position of the attacking
party, and the direction of a blow he given, the form, sit-
uation and direction of the wound may be inferred; and
the form, situation and direction of the wound being giv-
en, the form of the weapon, the relative position of the
attacking party and the direction of the blow may be in-
ferred. By the light of these principles of relation, I
have investigated and experimented. To any one who is
sceptical as to the correctness of their conclusions, the un-
<s>?????????????????????????????????????????????</s></m9>
<d>[Col.7]</d>
<m9>could be given only with the deliberate intention to kill,
it may be fairly inferred that he would have struck a per-
pendicular blow with all his force on the posterior superior
part or crown of the head; this would have been the most
severe and probably the only blow inflicted. Instead of
such a blow the one actually inflicted on the back part of
the head was comparatively slight; “a piece was chipped
off,” to use the language of Dr. Gilman. “This chipping
could not have been occasioned by a blow from behind un-
less Adams had had his head turned on one side sufficiently
far to see what Colt was about.”
   If Colt being behind Adams with intent to kill had con-
cluded to forego the great advantage of a perpendicular
blow for a side blow, his determination may be fairly in-
ferred to have arisen from a belief in the common notion
that a blow on the temple is one which proves the most
severely and quickly fatal. But both the side wounds on
the head of Adams were behind the ear and about as far
from the temple as possible.
   Independently of this consideration however, and that
arising from the difficulty of inflicting a blow on the left
side of the head from behind, it is clear that the fracture
on the left side could not have been produced by a blow
from the position now under consideration. The direction
and form of the fracture leaves no room for doubt concern-
ing this. If the blows of Colt had been given from be-
hind on the side of the head, it may be fairly granted that
as a blow on the right side could be the most easily and
forcibly, so it would have been the first given, and that it
would have been made with the whole force of Colt. But
the fracture on the right side is not of the severe charac-
ter which the employment of much force would occasion.
As Dr. Gilman remarked, there was “depression but not
detachment of bone. This fracture was quite small.”—
The circumstance of the greatest indentation being at the
anterior superior part of the fracture, is also greatly
against the probability of this fracture having been occa-
sioned by a blow from behind.
   That the fractures in front could be occasioned by
blows from behind no one will pretend. It would be
worse than useless therefore to make an argument on the
subject.
   2d. Colt did not inflict the blows on Adams from either
side.
   The proofs of this are many. A blow from the side
could hardly be inflicted unawares. Any unusual move-
ment on the part of Colt would have attracted the atten-
tion of Adams and caused him to confront Colt.
   Had Colt struck a side blow it would most probably
have been about the middle of the head on the lateral part
of the coronal region, but the blows were given on the
posterior part of the side of the head behind the ear.
   Blows on the side of the head inflicted from the side
must have been perpendicular, producing perpendicular
fractures; but neither of the side fractures were of this
description.
   It may be readily ascertained by experiment, that one
standing on the left side of the head and using the right
arm it would be impossible to inflict the right and frontal
wounds, and that standing on the right side of the head it
would be impossible to inflict the left and posterior wounds
found on the head of Adams.
   I have ascertained by experiment that standing on the
left side it is impossible to drive into the left side of <u>the
the</u> skull that corner of the hatchet which is nearest to the
handle, and that standing on the right side it would be ex-
tremely difficult and only by contorting the position of the
body and arm possible to make such a fracture as was
formed on the right side of the head of Adams.
   I have now exhausted the consideration of all the posi-
tions except the frontal. By supposing Colt to have been
in front of Adams during the infliction of the blows all the
fractures can readily be accounted for. It can be shown
too, that from no other single position could all these
wounds have been given. Experiments prove this, and
whoever makes the investigation will become satisfied, I
think, of the truth of another proposition—namely:
   VI. T<small>HAT WHEN THE WOUND ON THE LEFT SIDE
OF THE HEAD WAS INFLICTED</small> C<small>OLT AND</small> A<small>DAMS WERE
WITHIN A FOOT AND A HALF OF EACH OTHER</small>.
   Experiment. Two persons, A and B, were placed op-
posite and fronting each other, at the distance of a foot
and a half. B grasped in his right hand a hatchet similar
to that used by Colt, contracted his arm towards his shoul-
der and then struck forwards and downwards. He found
that he could thus inflict a wound similar in form and <u title="situation">situ-
tion</u> to that described on the left side of the head of
Adams. B. further found that such a wound could not be
inflicted in any other position or by any other movement,
for on keeping the same distance from A, but extending
the arm and then striking, his blow passed beyond the head
of A, and on extending the distance between himself and
A, and when striking he found that the situation or shape
of the wound would be altered.
   Having thus ascertained, as I believed, the relative po-
sition of Colt and Adams during the infliction of the
wound on the left side of the head I wished to ascertain
whether the other wounds could have been inflicted with-
out change of position or distance, I had little difficulty in
coming to a satisfactory conclusion.
   On receiving the blow on the left side the face of
Adams would be instinctively averted and the head thrown
towards the right shoulder, which would bring the back of
the head towards the left shoulder. After this change of
position it was found that a blow similar to the last made
while the parties remained at the same distance would
strike the occiput in the situation of the wound on the back
of the head of Adams and produced such a chipped frac-
ture.
   This second blow would drive the posterior part of the
head backwards, and cause it to reassume its natural posi-
tion, and I found that if the parties retained the same re-
lative distance, and the assailant lifted his arm, extended
it obliquely towards the right side of his antagonist, ro-
tated his hand, and then struck downwards and inwards,
he would bring the head of the hatchet in the precise sit-
uation of the wound on the right side of the head of Ad-
ams, and cause just such an indention.
   The fractures found on the forehead of Adams, could
not have been inflicted in the above mentioned position of
the parties; they required a more extended distance and
freer blows, nearly the length of the arm. The infliction
of the three wounds above mentioned would occasion pros-
tration, or great diminution of strength. If Adams grasp-
ed Colt his grasp would become enfeebled. If he had
been pressing against him he would be unable to continue
the effort; in either case the distance between the parties
would have become extended, and would have afforded
opportunity for the infliction of the last mentioned blows.
   Such are the facts and reasonings which have led me to
the conclusion that Adams and Colt were face to face dur-
ing the whole of the fatal rencontre.
   VII. A<small>DAMS WAS GRAPPLING WITH</small> C<small>OLT AT THE TIME
THE FIRST BLOW WITH THE HATCHET WAS GIVEN, AND WAS
THE FIRST TO CLOSE AND GRAPPLE</small>.
   It would be foreign to any investigation to enter into an
argument on this subject, founded on the improbability of
a predetermined attack on the part of Colt, connected
with time and place of the fatal rencontre or on the great
improbability of a man of acknowledged intellectual quick-
ness and power selecting a mode of attack that could not
but attract the attention of a neighbor separated from him
by a folding door merely, and one in the execution of
which the walls would necessarily be sprinkled, and the
floor almost deluged with blood, but there are a few con-
siderations in proof of our last proposition, on which we
would briefly dwell.
   1. If Colt had been the assailing party he would have se-
lected his position, and that it may be fairly granted would
have been one which would have given to Adams no chance
of outcry and no chance of opposition; he would have ap-
proached from behind, which he evidently did not.
   2. Had Colt commenced the attack and approached
Adams, in front with the hatchet, Adams would doubtless
have made an outcry which would have arrested the atten-
tion of Mr. Wheeler. The cry of alarm is one of the
most piercing and far-reaching.
   3. Had Colt commenced the attack he would have se-
lected his distance, a distance which would have given to
him the full sweep and force of his right arm; but it is
demonstrable, I think, that when the blow which occa-
sioned the fracture on the left side of the head of Adams
was inflicted, the parties were not more than about a foot
and a half asunder. And that blow I do not doubt was the
first inflicted.
   4. Adams was stouter than Colt—Colt was taller than
Adams. The blow on the left side must have been struck
forwardly, with a downward motion of the hand. Colt
must have been in a lower position than Adams on the in-
fliction of that wound. Had he been above him he could
not have struck the posterior corner of the edge of the
hatchet into the side of Adams' head, so as to make
fracture of the form inflicted.
   5. Had not Adams been grappling Colt at the time Colt
struck his first blow, Adams would naturally and instinctive-
ly have protected his face at the expense of his arms. On
a blow being struck at the head or face, the upward move-
ment of the arms is as much a matter of course as the with-
drawal of the head. The annals of the crime and of surgery
prove this in the most conclusive manner. But the arms of
Adams were uninjured. The testimony of Dr. Gilman
shows that the body of Adams was most minutely examined,
yet no injury, not even the slightest on the arms was disco-
vered. Such freedom from injury is incompatible with the
notion that the arms of Adams were disengaged during the
rencontre.				DAVID L. ROGERS, M. D.

		THE CASE OF COLT.
			——
   The murderer of Adams, after conviction and
an unsuccessful effort for a new trial before the
Oyer and Terminer, after having had the benefit
of a review of al the decisions of the court of
Oyer and Terminer, under a writ of error to the
Supreme Court, and after being sentenced to
death, again demanded a writ of error, with a
view to obtain a reconsideration of the case by
the Supreme Court, and ultimately to the court
for the Correction of Errors. This having been
denied by the Circuit Judge who tried the cause,
with the concurrence of the Chancellor and the
Justices of the Supreme Court, the interposition
of the Executive has been at last applied for
and urged with even more than the usual earn-
estness and as unusual an array of influence.
   The opinion of the Executive upon the ap-
plication, appears at length in the Eve. Journal
of Saturday. It is scarcely necessary to say,
that the Governor, after a patient examination
of the whole case, comes to a conclusion adverse
to the application—and that the culprit accord-
ingly expiates his crime by an ignominious
death on Friday next.
   The points presented for the consideration of
the Executive were these,
   1st. Whether any error in law has occurred in

   On all these points, and particularly in its
analysis of the evidence in the case, the opinion
of the Executive is clear, able, and as it seems
to us, conclusive. We shall transfer it to our
columns to-morrow. Meanwhile we copy the
concluding portion of it:—
   “The laws are always to be executed except
	...
the Executive as an injured, not as a penitent
man.”

of circumstances that we believe ever went forth in type.
An old man lived alone, and had forbidden a daughter,

ever to approach his place, on account merely of some
whimsical pique that the old <u title="wretch (elsewhere)">man</u> had taken against his
child. One morning the inhuman being found his grand-
child, under three years of age, climbing upon his gar-
den rail, and he deliberately went for his rifle and shot
the boy dead. The victim fell inside of the fence. The
old man reloaded and sat watching. Not long after the
mother came seeking her child, and the minute she
touched her father's garden rail, as she did with a shriek
the instant she perceived her dead child, the old brute
shot her in the temple and killed her stone dead on the
spot. The hoary maniac (as he is now accounted) shot
the father also when he came, and he is now in prison

thereof has appointed two deputy sheriffs to guard his
cell until the hour of execution. His friends and relatives
are to be allowed to see him, but to prevent any thing
being given him for self-destruction, one of the deputies
is to be present, or within sight, during the interview.
Thousands of applications have been made to the Sheriff
to witness the execution, but he has resolved on the only
proper course, that is, to allow none to be present except
those authorized by law, and a reasonable number of de-
puties to keep proper order, giving the city press one
representative each, and those the regular acknowledged
reporters.
   Several gentlemen who visited Colt yesterday state that
his appearance and manner is much changed since the re-
ception of the letter of Governor Seward, as he had placed
great reliance upon a pardon or commutation of his
sentence. He looked the very picture of wretchedness
yesterday, and talked relatively to his fast approaching fate
in a manner not such as would <u title="emanate">eminate</u> from one disposed
to commit suicide. On being questioned as to such an in-
tention, when his penknife and razors were taken from
him, he said that depriving him of them would not prevent
the accomplishment of such a deed, as he could open a vein
with his teeth if he desired, and thus bleed himself to
death.

<b>The Miller Camp Meeting at Newark—The

				N<small>EWARK</small>, Monday, Nov. 14.
   As far as regards Mr. Miller's connection with
Newark; personally, the long agony is over. Mr.
Miller took his departure to-day for New York
about two o'clock, by the steamboat; and what
further transpires must be chronicled by your do-
mestic crops of reporters.
   The farewell ceremonies took place in the Free
Church. The performances commenced at nine
o'clock in the morning with a hymn, the burthen of
which was:—
<m9>   My old companions fare you well—fare you well.
	Will you go?—will you go?
   I'm not going down to hell,
	Will you go?—will you go?</m9>
   This was set to the tune of:—
<m9>	Will you go?—will you go?
	All for to see the monkey show?
	Will you go?—will you go?</m9>

   M<small>RS.</small> F<small>ARNHAM'S</small> L<small>ECTURE ON</small> W<small>OMAN</small>.—Seeing a
<a class="l" href="#Tribune-1842-11-08-3-Mrs-Farnham-Lectures">notice</a> of a lecture at the Society Library yesterday
at 11 o'clock, A. M., we sent one of our reporters
to attend it. He reached the place at the appointed
hour, but finding only some dozen females present,
and that Mrs. Farnham had not yet arrived, he lin-
gered a few minutes at the door to converse with
the door-keeper, and make a few experiments in
physiology. From the philosophical door-keeper,
he learned much wisdom and logic; he learned
that Mrs. F. is a married woman, but not attended
by her husband—but whether they have been blessed
with children, the door-keeper did not say. This
is the second gratuitous lecture, which this excel-
lent lady has given, preaching for the benefit of the
age; the first was to about twenty-five persons.
The door-keeper further said, that reporters were
to be admitted to this lecture, although it was ad-
dressed to ladies only.
   During this physiological conversation, Mrs.
Farnham arrived at the door. She appeared to be
about thirty-five years old, and many persons per-
haps might think her tolerably good looking—but
as our reporter idolizes the sex, he was in raptures
with her bright eyes, elegant figure, and benevolent
face. After some private conversation with the
door-keeper, she went away to enter by the private
entrance. When our reporter proposed to enter,
the door-keeper asked him what paper he belonged
to? Answer, “the Herald.” He replied that the
orders he had just received were, to admit no
members of the press except from the Tribune, or
some such paper. Never baffled at any difficulty,
our reporter, immediately, though a little late in the
season for butterflies, assumed, through the power
of magnetism, which he possesses in a greater de-
gree than Col. Stone, the shape of a very beautiful
blue and pink fly, with ten legs and forty wings,
flew through the key-hole, and took his position on
the left ringlet of Mrs. Farnham's madonna's face
during the whole of the lecture. Here he heard
unutterable things—the whole secrets of nature de-
veloped—but not a word of cooking or of darning
stockings.
   It seems, therefore, that Mrs. Farnham is tread-
ing in the illustrious footsteps of the learned Mrs.
Gove, who had a husband, but instead of doing the
cooking and washing of her own family, went
through the world, contrary to the doctrine of Saint
Paul, trying to teach philosophy, philology, and
physiology. Now on this important subject—“the
position and duty of woman,” we coincide with the
opinion of Paul the Apostle, who was a pretty sensi-
ble man on many questions, considering that he was
merely a tent maker. Saint Paul thought that wo-
man's true “position and duty” was in confining
herself, it is true to the ologies, but it was cook-
ology—make-the-pudding-ology, darn-the-stocking-
ology—that the private parlor was her natural posi-
tion—not the public desk—that a peep into the
kitchen was more amiable and becoming than a
hop-step-and-skip into the lecture room.
   Instead, therefore, of attempting to deliver public
lectures in the city of New York, if Mrs. Farnham
would return to her home and husband, attend to
the affairs of her family—and mind the philosophy of
her parlor and kitchen, she would be giving a much
better practical lecture on the “position of woman,”
than by the course she is pursuing. Let her study
the following stanzas:—
<m9>				1742.
		Man to the plough,
		Wife to the cow,
		Girl to the yarn,
		Boy to the barn,
		And your rents will be netted.
				1842.
		Man tally ho,
		Miss piano,
		Wife silk and satin,
		Boy Greek and Latin,
		And you'll all be gazetted.</m9>

   C<small>ASE OF</small> J<small>OHN</small> C. C<small>OLT</small>.—This person, sentenced to
be hung on Friday next, is now under deep concern
of mind relative to his future state, produced mainly
from the efforts of the Rev. Dr. Anthon, of St.
Mark's church. The first visit of this gentleman,
which was a few days since, was followed by no
result, but on the second, on Monday, Colt's stub-
born nature gave way, and he expressed the utmost
earnest desire to listen to the consoling aid of this
reverend gentleman. Several others of the clergy
had previously visited him, but without any effect.
He now refuses to see any other except Dr. Anthon,
and was this morning most earnestly engaged in
prayer with this reverend gentleman. He is now a
full and sincere believer in a state of future rewards
and punishments.
   Hundreds were flocking to the city prison this
morning to see him, but no one was admitted except
his friends, or those introduced by them. A deputy
sheriff is present to prevent any instrument being
given to him whereby he might destroy himself,
although he disavows any intention to commit such
an act. His physical appearance is wonderfully
changed since Sunday, and he looks as though he
had been confined to a sick bed for months.
   Until this morning the had given up all hopes of
either pardon or respite, but from the proceedings of
a meeting of a <u title="portion (elsewhere)">party</u> of the members of the Bar of
this city, held in the <u title="Supreme (elsewhere)">Sessions</u> Court room, this morn-
ing, as given below, no doubt that a hope is again
revived in his bosom that he may live over the time
now fixed for his execution. Should such not be the
case, the result will be met with a severer pang than
if these efforts had not been made.
   The meeting was called to order by appointing <u title="Samuel G. (elsewhere)">J.
H.</u> Raymond, Esq. Chairman, and <u title="Thomas W. (elsewhere)">Francis</u> Tucker,
Secretary. There were about two hundred persons
present, and some of the speakers were received by
hisses, and other marks of disapprobation from some
of the audience. Messrs. J. W. Edmonds, E. Paine,
and M. C. <u title="Paterson (elsewhere)">Patterson</u>, Esq. addressed the meeting,
and James T. Brady, Esq. introduced the following
resolutions:—
<m9>   Resolved.—That the right to revise the decision of infe-
rior tribunals in the Court of last resort is a right so es-
sential to the due administration of the laws, that a refu-
sal except in cases free from all doubt amounts to a denial
of justice.
   Resolved.—That the question whether under the Con-
stitution of this State, a Court of Oyer and Terminer can
be held otherwise than by judges appointed by the Gover-
nor and Senate, although discussed, remains undecided in
the Court of Errors, and deserves serious deliberation,</m9>
<d>[<a class="e" id="Herald-1842-11-15-eve-3" href="http://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper%2014/New%20York%20NY%20Herald/New%20York%20NY%20Herald%201842/New%20York%20NY%20Herald%201842%20-%202071.pdf">Col.1</a>]</d>
<m9>the words of the Constitution being “The Governor shall
nominate and with the consent of the Senate shall appoint
all judicial officers except justices of the peace.”
	...
   Resolved.—That the execution of any convict, (what-
ever his crime,) is of no greater importance to the com-
munity than such an administration of the laws as will
produce implicit confidence in the decisions and decrees of
our courts of justice.</m9>
   The resolutions were then adopted, and a com-
mittee of five was appointed to forward copies to
the Governor, Chancellor, and Judges of the Su-
preme Court, to decide upon publishing the same,
and to ask a temporary reprieve of the Governor.
   The chairman appointed Messrs. James T. Brady,
Ward, Griffith, <u title="Patterson (elsewhere)">Paterson</u>, J. W. Edmonds; and on
motion, the Chairman and Secretary were added.
The meeting then adjourned.

   <i>John C. Colt</i>.—The decision of the Governor on
the case of this unhappy man was communicated to
him on Sunday, at about 1 o'clock in the day, by J. L.
Graham. Esq., who was accompanied to his cell by
several gentlemen. At the reading of the paper to
Colt, he shew strong marks of emotion, but it was
not until he had been long urged, that he consented
to allow a Clergyman to visit him. At last he se-
lected for that purpose, the Reverend Mr. Anthon,
who was with him in his cell for some hours yester-
day. His demeanor is now much more suitable to
his unfortunate situation, though we understand he
still expresses no compunction for the commission of
the crime, which he is about to expiate with his life.
He was manacled and chained to the floor on Sun-
day, but yesterday the Sheriff released him from his
irons, and he is now under no more restraint than
he was before.
   It is to be hoped that no ill-judging friends will, by
raising hopes that may not be gratified, prevent him
duly preparing to meet the awful fate, which awaits
him.

MEETING OF THE BAR ON THE CASE OF
		JOHN C. COLT.
   We annex the proceedings of this meeting with-
out comment, other than to say that a wide differ-
ence of opinion exists among the members of the bar
themselves, and that before the adjournment of the
meeting, Mr. Paine rose to ask whether, under the
terms of the call, any one opposed, as he was, to the
course about to be taken, and who approved of the
decision of the Chancellor and the Supreme Court,
could be heard.
   Mr. Raymond, the Chairman, read the call, and
decided that he could <i>not</i>—whereupon Mr. Paine
sat down.
   Friday is the day appointed for the execution.—
We understand the Sheriff has been advised that the
warrant for execution being signed by one of the
Aldermen, is illegal, and therefore should not be
carried into effect. What the result is to be, re-
mains to be seen. Meanwhile, we cannot but hope
the wretched prisoner may be kept in ignorance of
these proceedings, whatever is to be their issue.

   In publishing yesterday Governor Seward's opin-
ion in the case of John C. Colt, we might well
have accompanied it with some notice of the abili-
ty with which it is drawn up. It is clear in the ar-
rangement, full without prolixity, and expressed
with simplicity and directness. As to the conclu-
sion to which he has arrived, we are inclined to
think him right, although in a case involving the
life of a fellow creature, in which the evidence is
of so complicated a nature, no man should express
himself positively, without a most careful consider-

		   <b>The Case of John C. Colt.</b>
<l9>   The Governor has refused to interfere between
this convict and the doom of that law to which he
has made himself amenable. His Excellency's let-
ter, announcing his decision and setting forth the
grounds upon which it is sustained, will be found
on the fist page, and will no doubt be read with
attention by every one into whose hands it may
come. Without expressing any opinion as to the
correctness of the result arrived at—which notwith-
standing the example set us by other journals, we
conceive to be improper while the convict is yet
living, and within the possibility of mercy—we have
no hesitation in saying that the Governor's letter
is one of the ablest—perhaps the very ablest—state
paper he has had occasion to write in the whole
course of his administration. In the becoming gra-
vity of its tone, the acumen of its legal distinctions,
the force of its argumentation and the evidence it
bears in every line of deep, dispassionate and earn-
est thought, we look upon it as a model for Execu-
tive communications of this nature.
   On Friday next, therefore, unless there be an in-
terposition by that power in the sight of which all
human power is but weakness, John C. Colt must
die upon the scaffold. The end, so long and so ve-
hemently resisted, at lat is drawing nigh. The
spectacle is sublime but fearful. For nearly a year
we have seen this unhappy man struggling with des-
perate energy within the coils of that invisible yet
mighty force which to human guilt <u title="awards (in Spectator)">rewards</u> human
retribution. Slow, unimpassioned, alike unsway-
ed by anger, or sympathy, or fear—moving on-
ward to its dread purpose with deliberate yet inevi-
table progress, and grasping the object of its dire
intent with a hold so subtle that it seems not to ex-
ist, yet so tenacious, so terrible, that only death can
shake it loose—the LAW, the invisible, intangible
impersonation of all the force that is in banded mil-
lions, having held within its clutch for so many
months the struggling victim of its justice, endu-
ring calmly, yet not the less irresistibly defeating,
all his efforts to escape, is now about to sweep him
from the face of the earth, the helpless subject of
its mighty power.
   Of his agonies, his hopes, his terrors and his re-
morse, as of the tears and anguish that may be at-
tendant upon his doom, and of the shame and sor-
row that may hereafter be associated with his name
in the memories of kindred—of all these it can take
no heed. Its mission is to do justice upon the guil-
ty; and for this it must have no heart, no affections,
no chord of human feeling to vibrate at the touch of
grief or the frenzied grasp of despairing misery.
   And the fulfilment of its mission is needful—in-
dispensable—to the well-being of society. In its
resistless might, its stern impassibility, its relent-
less execution of its own decrees, lies the safeguard
of our lives and property; and painful as its minis-
tration is to the kindly feelings of our nature, we
must burrow a portion of its own stony-hearted in-
sensibility and approve, if we may not choose but
grieve for, the fulfilment of its terrible awards.</l9>

<l9><b>Gov. Seward's Examination of Colt's Case.</b>
   Among all the able State papers which have pro-
ceeded from Gov. Seward, not one of them, as it
strikes us, does him more credit, by its acute and
sound discrimination, and its compact and well-put
argument, than his examination of Colt's case, as
published in our paper yesterday, on the petition for
pardon. It will, we think, entirely satisfy every

<l9>   Governor Seward refuses to interfere or commute
the sentence of Colt, and he will, in all probability,
suffer the extreme penalty of the law on Friday
next. The opinion of the Governor, as published
in the New York papers of this morning, is a mas-
terly argument, and if doubt existed heretofore as
to the justice of Colt's sentence, a perusal of the
opinion of Gov. Seward will go far to remove it. The
fact of any hope of respite or pardon having ceased,
was yesterday conveyed to Colt, and it is said, that
for the first time he evinced symptoms of dejection.</l9>

   <i>Extraordinary Proceedings</i>.—The <a class="l" href="#American-1842-11-14-Col6">evening papers</a>
of Monday, contained the following anonymous call
for a meeting of a certain portion of the Bar.—
Whence it emanated we know not; but the simple
fact that the authors did not think proper to attach
their signatures to it, is <i>prima facie</i> evidence that
they knew it was an improper and unjustifiable pro-
ceeding.
<l9>   “M<small>EETING OF THE</small> B<small>AR</small>.—A meeting is called for
to-morrow morning, at 9 o'clock, of those members
of the Bar who are opposed to the action taken by
which leave was refused to John C. Colt, to take the
opinion of the Court of Errors, whether the Court
which tried him, was legally constituted or not.”</l9>
   In pursuance of this call at about 11 o'clock yes-
terday, seventeen members of the Bar assembled and
organized a meeting. Subsequently the number was
increased to <i>twenty-eight</i>, and finally the whole num-
ber present amounted to <i>thirty-six!</i> Of this number
our informant and old Practitioner of high standing,
could recognize as members of the Bar but <i>eight</i> in-
dividuals—the others being young men who have re-
cently joined the profession. The Bar of New York
numbers upwards of <i>eleven hundred;</i> and we cannot
but congratulate that highly respectable body, that so
small a portion of them met in pursuance of this
anonymous call.
   We gave in another column the proceedings of the
meeting, copied from the <i><a class="l" title="Not this report is given in Col.2" href="#American-1842-11-15">American</a></i>; and we feel it a
duty to express our decided disapprobation of this
whole proceeding as calculated to bring the adminis-
tration of justice in our city into disrepute, at the
same time that it is cruel and inhuman towards
the unfortunate convict who is so shortly to suffer
the sentence of the law.
   Beyond all question the parties to this meeting,
<i>knew</i> that there is not the shadow of a shade of pro-
bability, that Governor S<small>EWARD</small> will interfere in be-
half of the prisoner, after the full and deliberate
opinion which he has placed before the public of the
justice of his conviction and of the legality of the
proceedings upon his trial. It was therefore, cruel
and inhuman to excite a <i>hope</i> in the breast of the un-
fortunate criminal which cannot possibly be realized;
and it would be an act of mercy to C<small>OLT</small> if some of
his friends would call his attention to that passage of
the Executive's opinion wherein he says:
<l9>   “By a humane provision of law, a full report of
every conviction of a capital case is required to be
made to the Governor, who in considering the same
is entitled to the advice of the Chancellor, the Jus-
tices of the Supreme Court, and the Attorney Gene-
ral. The Justices of the Supreme Court have care-
fully reviewed the report in the present case, and
unanimously certified that the verdict was just. If
the Governor entertained doubts of its correctness,
he might, perhaps, rightfully relinquish them and
confide in the opinions of his learned judicial advi-
sers. But justice to the jury, and a proper regard
for the security of society, as a <i>desire</i> to temper the
administration of the laws with <i>mercy</i>, have <i>induced
an examination of the testimony <u title="independently">independantly</u> <u>of the
of the</u> jury and legal tribunals, and the result is a
conviction,</i> <small>UNDISTURBED BY ANY DOUBT</small>, <i>that the ac-
cused was guilty of the murder of</i> S<small>AMUEL</small> A<small>DAMS</small>.”</l9>
   But say this meeting of the Bar, “the Court was not
legally constituted.” Here again let C<small>OLT</small> be assu-
red that the objection is not a new one and has been
deliberately weighed and finally passed upon by the
executive. That high functionary says in the docu-
ment referred to:
<l9>   “The Supreme Court has heretofore decided that
those statutes were constitutional; and that the Al-
dermen <u title="were">ware</u> judges <i>de jure</i>, and that even if they
were not judges <i>de jure</i>, the were judges <i>de facto</i>;
	...
<i>would thus be perverted and made the agent of disor-
der and revolution</i>.”</l9>
   We make this extract to show how utterly hope-
less is this effort for a reprieve or pardon; and in the
hope that the friends of C<small>OLT</small>, will not permit the
proceedings of this ill-timed, cruel, and in our judg-
ment, highly improper meeting, to inspire him with
a hope of either respite of pardon. In common
with all humane persons, we cannot but <u title="commiserate">commisse-
rate</u> his fate; and it is because we do <u title="commiserate">commisserate</u>
it at the same time that we believe it to be just and
necessary, that we would guard him from the indul-
gence of a <i>hope</i>, which all who know the firmness of
the Executive, are well convinced, can never be re-
alized. The time has passed for all hope in man;
and he should be warned that he must look to his
G<small>OD</small> only, for consolation and comfort in this hour
of need.
   But while we thus condemn the cruelty of this
meeting towards C<small>OLT</small>; let its offensive character
against the peace and good order of this community
not be overlooked. A venerable citizen remarked to
us while this meeting was in session—“Were Colt as
popular as <i><a class="l" href="#Courier-1839-02-14">Ezra White</a></i>, this meeting would be deem-
ed good grounds for a rescue. <a class="l" href="#American-1839-10-14">Thank God</a> the pub-
lic feeling and the <a class="l" href="#Courier-1839-11-25">sentence</a> of the <a class="l" href="#American-1840-12-30">law</a> are in <a class="l" href="#Herald-1841-05-15">harmo-
ny</a>, or I <a class="l" href="#Evening-Post-1841-05-15">should</a> <a class="l" href="#Tribune-1841-05-24">tremble</a> for the <a class="l" href="#Herald-1841-06-01">peace</a> of our City.”
   And this is the general feeling of our fellow citizens,
openly and unequivocally expressed yesterday.—
What? After the law has gravely consigned its vic-
tim to his fate, and after an appeal has been granted to
the Supreme Court, and after the Executive of the
State has calmly and most ably reviewed the whole
proceedings and refused to stay the execution—after
all this, shall a meeting of the Bar convene under an
anonymous call, and attempt to arrest the sentence
of the Law and put at defiance the Jury, the Courts,
the Judges, the Executive and the public? Surely
this is wrong; and what is more, as a precedent,
<i>dangerous</i> to the peace and welfare of this commu-
nity. Never before have we heard any public meet-
ing so universally and so unsparingly condemned as
this has been; and we are proud to know, that of the
eleven hundred members of our Bar, only thirty-six
could be induced for a single moment thus to commit
themselves and permit their feelings for a condemn-
ed fellow-being, to blind them to their duty to them-
selves and to the society of which they are mem-
bers. It is however, we do not doubt, an error
founded on generous impulses, and one which the
reflecting portion of the public may readily for-
give, because reflection will unquestionably induce all
the parties concerned, to see the heinousness of this
proceeding, and deeply to regret their hasty and ill-
advised action. As a general rule, we would
advise all young men never to attend a meeting call-
ed for such questionable purposes that the instigators
of it, dare not append their names to the call. Such
was the meeting of yesterday; and if as reported, a
lawyer of some standing has <u>give</u> a written opin-
ion to induce the Sheriff to omit to execute C<small>OLT</small>
on Friday, we cannot but feel that we have indeed
fallen upon evil times. If this be really so, the soon-
er it is known to the public the better; and the name
of the lawyer should be published in order that all
may know who it is that could presume thus to tam-
per with a public officer. There can be no apology
whatever for such conduct; and it will be condemned
even by those who may honestly doubt the guilt of
the Prisoner.

<d>[Col.2]</d>
   <i>Case of John C. Colt</i>.—Yesterday a meeting of the
Bar was held in the room of the Court of Common
Pleas, to take into consideration the refusal to allow
the case of this prisoner to be carried to the Court
for the Correction of Errors.
<l9>   The meeting having been organized by the ap-
pointment of S. G. R<small>AYMOND</small>, Esq. as President, and
Thomas W. Tucker, Esq. as Secretary.
   Mr. J. T. Brady moved the adoption of the follow-
ing resolution.
   Resolved, That the right to review the decisions of
	...
   Resolved, That the execution of any convict, what-
ever his crime, is of no greater importance to the
community than such an administration of the laws
as will produce implicit public confidence in the de-
cisions and decrees of our Courts of Justice.
   M. C. <u>Paterson</u>, Esq. then briefly addressed the
meeting, arguing that it was the right of every mem-
ber of the community to be allowed to take his cause
before the Court of last resort in the most trifling
cases, and much more ought it to be so in a case
which affected the life of any individual.
   J. W. Edmonds, Esq. followed, arguing against
the impolicy and injustice of the law, if it had been
correctly represented, as in a case respecting the
most trifling amount in value of property, it was the
inalienable right of a citizen to obtain a writ of error
and so procure the decision of the Highest Court in
the State. He thought that if the Chancellor—one
member of the 34 of which the Court of Errors was
composed—had a right to say to his 33 brethren, in
a case touching the life of a citizen, that they should
not decide upon that case at his request, then it was
high time that the community should <u title="know">knaw</u> the posi-
tion in which they stood and be warned in turn.
   Elijah Payne, Esq. then enquired of the Chairman
whether this mas a meeting held for the purpose of
discussion, or whether it was merely of those mem-
bers of the bar who were opposed to the action of the
Judges and Executive, as if the former was the case
he should wish to express his opinions, approving as
he did of all those decisions.
   The Chairman decided that the meeting was called
to consist of those opposed to the action which had
been had.
   Mr. Payne acquiesced in the decision and left the
room.
   The resolutions were then unanimously adopted,
and on motion, they were referred to a Committee to
consist of the Chairman, Secretary, Mr. Brady, R.
R. Ward, H. W. Griffith, M. C. <u>Paterson</u>, and J. W.
Edmonds, with directions to print them and have
copies forwarded to the Governor, the Chancellor,
and the Members of the Supreme Court.
   On motion of Mr. Scoles, the Committee was also
directed to endeavor to obtain a reprieve for Colt, to
enable the case to<u title=" be"> </u>carried before the Court for the
Correction of Errors.
   The meeting then adjourned.</l9>

<d>[Col.2]</d>
   F<small>ATHER</small> M<small>ILLER, AND HIS</small> E<small>NEMIES</small>—Seven of
our cotemporaries are making themselves marvel-
lously savage upon Father Miller and his men call-
ing them “ignorant, superstitious and credulous”—
a “corps of illiterate and besotted disciples”—
“preposterous nonsense”<u title="—“">—</u>infernal orgies”—“idi-
otic proselytes”—“illiterate quacks”—“idiots and
knaves,” &c. &c.
   We are not surprised at this disgusting and extra-
ordinary language. History furnishes us with a
thousand examples of similar intolerance during the
progress of civilization. Miller, with the Bible in
his hand, and pointing to the Book of Daniel, be-
lieves and preaches that the world will end next
year—and with this belief he unites morals and pu-
rity of life and conduct. We do not believe as Mil-
ler believes—but we doubt whether it is manly or
candid to call him bad names, and impute crimes to
him, merely on account of his opinions. We be-
	...
rash-lights? Old Miller is a very moral, pious, good
sort of a man—and if his calculations are wrong, as
we believe he has missed a figure or two, a few
months will set him right. After a great deal of re-
flection we have come to this conclusion—that it is
best to encourage and promulgate all views on eve-
ry subject, as the best method to reach the truth in
the end. This is the true ground. Every sect in
religion or philosophy has some gold in the midst of
much dross. Pick out the gold, and let the dross fly
away with the next wind of forgetfulness.

   C<small>ASE OF</small> J<small>OHN</small> C. C<small>OLT</small>.—This person, sentenced to
be hung on Friday next, is now under deep concern
	...
Until yesterday he had given up all hopes of
either pardon or respite, but from the proceedings of
a meeting of a <u title="party (elsewhere)">portion</u> of the members of the Bar of
this city, held in the Sessions Court room, yester-
day, as given below, no doubt that a hope is again
revived in his bosom that he may yet live over the
time now fixed for his execution. Should such not
be the case, the result will be met with a severer
pang than if these efforts had not been made.<a id="Herald-1842-11-16-Colts-Counsel-to-Sheriff"></a>
   We also understand that David Graham, Esqr.,
has intimated, or given notice to Sheriff Hart, that
if he proceeds to execute Colt under the warrant of
the Court of Oyer and Terminer, he will be liable
to a prosecution for homicide, as the Court is not, in
his opinion, constitutionally organized, with the Al-
dermen acting as Judges! This is, altogether, in-
cluding the meeting yesterday morning, a queer and
strange proceeding, and particularly so when it is
considered that the attempt is made to retard and
defeat the due administration of the laws by the pas-
sage of a set of resolutions! This is a strange coun-
try, and we are a strange people truly.
   The meeting was called to order by appointing <u title="Samuel G. (elsewhere)">J.

<m9>   Resolved, That the execution of any convict, (what-

immense audience last evening at the large church
corner of Madison and Catherine streets. The
building was crowded to overflowing at a very
early hour, and before the sermon had commenced,
every avenue of entrance was closed. His sermon
was similar to one previously reported. He will
preach again this evening at the same place, but the
house will not be large enough to hold half who
wish to hear him.

		<b>Boz's New Work.</b>
   Charles Dickens's long looked for Book on the
United States, has at last made its appearance in
this country. It was received in New York the
beginning of last week, and 60,000 copies at 12½
cents a piece, were sold in <i>two days</i>. We have
not yet had an opportunity of reading the whole
of it; but if we may form an opinion form the nu-
merous extracts which we have met with in the
newspapers, it is a mixture of <i>good</i> and <i>bad</i>. Some
of his reflections and suggestions upon our insti-
tutions and national manners are just, and worthy
of consideration and adoption. Whilst others are
as unjust and libellous as the very worst passa-
ges in Mrs. Trollop or Captain Marryatt. The
extracts are written in a blundering manner, and
will add nothing to Boz's reputation either as an
<i>author</i> or a <i>man</i>! We are glad to see our coun-
trymen beginning to place a proper estimate upon
such books as this. They laugh at their misrep-
resentations, and treat their slanders with proper
contempt.

		<b>A Tale of Horror.</b>
   In the <u title="Kuninsas, Runinsas (elsewhere)">Runisas</u> (Iowa) Gazette, we find the
most extraordinary and cruel relation of circum-
stances that we believe ever went forth in type.
An old man lived alone, and had forbidden a
daughter, who lived near, and her husband, or
even their children, ever to approach his place,
on account merely of some whimsical pique
that the old <u title="man (elsewhere)">wretch</u> had taken against his child.

		<a class="l" href="#Herald-1842-11-03-Col6"><b>Colt's Case.</b></a>
   The application for a Writ of Error, in Colt's
case, was denied last week, by the Chancellor,
he declaring that justice, to be worth any thing,
should be speedy and certain. No further le-
gal proceedings can take place, and the sen-
tence of the Judge must either be carried into
effect, or be commuted by the action of the Gov-
ernor. It is stated that great efforts are ma-
king to procure a pardon—and that a long pe-
tition is now before the Governor, signed by
Dudley Selden, James Watson Webb, M. M.
Noah, Moses Y. Beach, and many others.

<b>A Man may marry his Wife's Sister.</b>
   The Presbyterian Synod of New Jersey,
which convened last week at Elizabethtown,
decided that it was not incestuous for a man to
marry the sister of his deceased wife, and the
Synod calls upon the General Assembly to re-
scind the rule forbidding such marriages.

<f12>   Gov. Seward, of New York, having
refused to pardon or commute the
sentence of this wretched man, he
will therefore, expiate his crime upon
the gallows on Friday next, the 18th
instant. Great efforts have been made
in his behalf to influence the Gover-
nor to mitigate his sentence, but that
functionary under the solemn convic-
tion of his guilt, fears that the execu-
tive interference in his case would be
a violation of public justice, and an
act of clemency entirely uncalled for,
and at variance with a full and im-
partial administration of the laws.

   P<small>REACHING VS.</small> P<small>RACTICE</small>.—It ap-
pears that Parson Miller is coming
the “humbug” strong over his deluded
followers, and does not seriously think
the world is so near a close as he
wishes them to believe. He is put-
ting up a solid brick wall around his
farm, near White Hall, New York,
which will probably endure for a
thousand years. A person offered
him $2,000 for the farm, and not to
take possession till after 1843; the
prudent prophet refused, alleging that
such an offer, depending as it does,
upon a future event, is nothing more
than gambling.

<l9>   A<small>LBANY</small> P<small>OLICE</small>.—A C<small>URIOUS</small> C<small>ASE OF</small> F<small>EMALE</small>
D<small>ECEPTION</small>.—One of those strange and almost un-
accountable cases of deception which we hear of
once or twice in an age, was developed at the po-
lice office Saturday afternoon. A person who has
for the last four years followed the business of a
tinker and teamster alternately in this city, and
who is well known to many of our citizens, was
brought up before Justice Osborn, charged with
hanging out false signals—being not exactly what
outward appearances would lead honest and un-
suspecting persons to believe—sailing under false
colors.
   About two weeks since this person was married
to a very respectable and hard working girl, who
by her industry had laid up a considerable sum of
money. The poor girl found out in a few days
that all is not gold that glitters—that appearances
are deceitful—in short, that her dear <i>husband</i> was
a <i>woman</i>! This fact being fully established to
the satisfaction of all parties, the faithless swain
—or rather deceitful jade—was arrested, examin-
ed at the police, and sent to jail. A crowd of the
curios followed her ladyship to her new lodgings
making many original and spirited remarks, called
out by the novelty of the <u title="scene (elsewhere)">case</u>.
   No other reason can be assigned for this strange
marriage alliance, except the desire on the part of
the <i>husband</i> to posses <i>himself</i> of the money which
the object of <i>his</i> affections had saved up from her
hard earnings and unwearied industry.

shown the interesting collections and productions

every thing as far as possible, and thwarted only
in that which might be hurtful to him. Employ-

solitary confinement, and ennui, are the principal
engines employed to excite and to encourage, to
soothe and to tame. Next day, therefore, the
new comer is conducted to the work-rooms of the
patients, where they are engaged in <u title="carpenter's">carpenters'</u>
and pasteboard work, spinning, knitting, sewing,
embroidery, &c., and asked whether he likes any
of those occupations. If he takes a fancy to one

tion<u title="—">, </u>intellectual employment, reading in the se-

only who are far advanced towards<u title=" "> a </u>cure, he is
led out of the work-rooms, lest as it is observed,
the industrious gentlemen there should be dis-
turbed, and taken to a solitary apartment, where
sometimes he is attacked ere long by ennui. If
he complains of it, he is led back to the work-<u title="rooms">room</u>,

rations going forward there, with a promise that
he shall then join in the pleasant tea-parties also.

small sum is allowed him, that the insane see-

<u title="employ">employed</u> themselves with pasteboard work, a
trade which is easily learned, and the products
of which, as they speedily lead to some results,
are not long in affording pleasure and profit. Of
the 130 patients in the house, in 1835, fifty were
dismissed, half of them cured, and the other half,
as incurable, delivered up to their friends, at the
desire of the latter; and twenty-four died in the
course of the year.

		<m9>For the Evening Post.</m9>
   M<small>RS.</small> F<small>ARNHAM'S</small> L<small>ECTURES</small>.—Having by acci-
dent seen some <a class="l" href="#Herald-1842-11-15-2-Col4">remarks</a>, in an infamous morn-
ing paper, in disparagement of Mrs. Farn-
ham's lectures on the appropriate duties of the fe-
male sex, I consider it an act of justice to that lady
to take off, so far as truth may, any thing of the
ridiculous, which the reporter for that print en-
deavors to attach to them.
   Mrs. Farnham believes that the exposition of
certain duties, peculiarly feminine, may dispose
her own sex to allow more importance to those
duties; and that thus their peculiar work of self-
culture, as well as the right discharge of sex-like
duty, may be promoted. She invites those ladies
who are concerned in the welfare of society, and
who may be desirous to know if they can be better
enabled to bear their part in its great interests, to
hear what she has to say that may enlighten their
minds.
<l95>   She invites none of the other sex—not because
she has any thing to announce that those modest
creatures would blush to hear—but because female
diffidence revolts at speaking, in their presence, of
matters which essentially concern the female sex,
and moreover do not principally concern the other.
To men belong great public responsibilities, which
rational females never desire to interfere with; but
it does not follow that they are not desirous to be
instructed in the best means of doing and gaining
good for themselves, in their own distinctive walk
of life, and that they are not at liberty to choose
the mode of giving and receiving such instruction.
The appropriate sphere of woman is undoubtedly
in the care of herself, her household, and her chil-
dren. But what sort of care is demanded of her?
—that of her own body and theirs, or the super-
added care of her own mind, her own moral nature,
and theirs besides? Mrs. Farnham's notion of a
woman's moral power is, that her influence, good
or bad, leads to great issues; and that as “they,”
(man or woman either,) “are best, who best know
why,” it would be well for women to learn wherein
they fail and come short, and how they may fulfil
their whole function in life. This is her honest
purpose. If it appear to any matter of indifference
—to any unlikely that she can afford them instruc-
tion—it is unquestionably well for such persons to
stay at home from her lectures. But if other fe-
males are curious, from any fair and just motive, of
hearing what she has to say, as one of her hearers,
the writer is disposed to prevent false impressions
from deterring them.
   The prospectus issued by Mrs. Farnham an-
nounces that she will give some instructions in
those laws of nature that must be regarded for the
preservation of personal health, the successful
treatment of children, and the mitigation of dis-
ease. Men are not so fond of paying doctor's bills,
that they are afraid of that knowledge in the other
sex which may avert illness, foster the sound mind
in the sound body of the rising race, and guide the
compassionate heart of woman to skilful effort for
sick and disabled man. To such ends tend Mrs.
Farnham's physiological details. If there is no
need of such instructions—if there are no ignorant,
prejudiced and inexperienced women in the world,
that do harm and might do good—then instructions
of this sort can be of no use.
   Mrs. Farnham, proposes, also, to illustrate the
moral functions of women—to show that if much
good has been done by some of them, much good
still remains to be done, which the indolent, or the
untaught, under authority of better information,
might effect.
   She looks abroad upon the sin and misery that
abound in our great half-taught, and wholly
neglected classes, and enquires, if these frivolous
and profligate among the opulent, these paupers
and felons among the indigent, had had wise and
good mothers, or wise and good counsel of those
who might have acted a mother's part, where
mothers were not,—at that age when the human
soul “is wax to receive and marble to retain,”—
whether other fruits would not have grown out of
other culture? And she further asks, if more than
have yet exerted themselves to advance human
virtue and happiness might not exalt themselves
to the whole work given to be done, if they knew
and felt the whole of their ability and obligations?
The eight hours of so many successive lectures
that she proposes to give, are not likely to be un-
profitably employed in speculations upon an in-
creased cultivation of the mind—the diminution of
needless expense—the enlargement of useful
charity—the prevention of superinduced crime—
the preparation of youth for the services of matu-
rity, and the defences of wisdom against the rivalry,
vanity, and prodigality which form the daily lessons
and example of the world—to women, old and
young, in the present day.
   Mrs. Farnham's first lecture, was written ex-
tremely well—with good sense, and reason, and in
good style, and taste.				A HEARER.</l95>

			<b>John C. Colt's case.</b>
<l9>   We have seldom read a more talented and learned
opinion than that given by Governor Seward in the
case of this unfortunate man, and which we publish-
ed yesterday. It is a summing up of the whole
case, by a most masterly hand. It is alike touching,
feeling and dignified, and the conclusion his Excel-
lency has arrived at, although painful, and most fa-
tal to the last lingering hope of the prisoner, is ne-
vertheless just, and one that will be approved of by
nineteen-twentieths, at least of this community.—
Governor Seward is now about to retire from his
present elevated station. It is therefore a fitting
occasion to speak of him, in his exercise of the par-
doning power—a power which has been in former
times most shamefully abused. In years past it has
been too frequently the case, that after all the trou-
ble, vexation, and expense that has been incurred
in convicting offenders, it was found exceedingly
easy to obtain a pardon, and criminals that had been
a terror to the public, were found after a short de-
tention, committing new depredations. Governor
Seward has pursued a course of a high and com-
manding order, and which ought to be a model for
those that may come after him. The pardoning
power in him has been safely lodged. It has rarely
been exercised, but when it has, it has been under
circumstances when every man who was at all ac-
quainted with the facts, was perfectly satisfied with
the justice of the mercy extended. In most cases,
when even family, political, and benevolent interest
has been made, as was the <a class="l" href="#American-1840-06-05">case with Rathbun</a>, <a class="l" href="#Tribune-1842-05-13-Benjamin-Rathbun">it
has been denied</a>. We believe all parties will unite
in one expression of approbation of the Governor's
conduct in regard to his exercise of the pardoning
power.</l9>

   F<small>EMALE</small> L<small>ECTURING</small>.—Some exquisite booby, who
calls himself a “<a class="l" href="#Evening-Post-1842-11-16">Hearer</a>,” but who does not say
whether he wears petticoats, is very savage upon
our reporter, because he <a class="l" href="#Herald-1842-11-15-2-Col4">advised</a> Mrs. Farnham,
who is giving <a class="l" href="#Tribune-1842-11-08-3-Mrs-Farnham-Lectures">lectures</a> here in the style of Mr. Gove,
to go home to her husband, and mind her family
affairs, instead of attempting to deliver lectures.
   The propriety of this advice may be seen in the
very “hearer” himself. Mrs. Farnham professes,
we suppose, to teach her auditors how to behave
with decency, propriety and decorum. These les-
sons have had very little effect upon her hearers,
when we see one of them coming out in the news-
papers, and denouncing another person who only
gave good advice, with all the vehemence and viru-
lence of a regular Xantippe.
   Mrs. Farnham, by this example, would seem to
succeed better in teaching her hearers how to scold,
than any thing else. Women lecturing! Oh! fie!
The only kind they should indulge in, is curtain-
lecturing.

   F<small>ATHER</small> M<small>ILLER AND</small> H<small>IS</small> D<small>OINGS</small>.—At the recent
Camp Meeting at Newark, Father Miller made about
100 converts; one man is about to sell his property
and join them; and one man in Patterson has sold
his to the amount of $17,000. At Newark, the con-
cern lost $100, which had to be made up by the con-
verts there. He has preached three days in this city
on the prophecies of Daniel, similar to the reports
we gave last week. The church at the corner of
Catherine and Madison streets has been crowded
to suffocation all the time. We are sorry to
hear that on Tuesday night some ruffians threw
stones at the window; and that last night when Fa-
ther Miller left the church a mob surrounded and
followed him down to Pearl street, shouting and
hooting, although he had a lady on his arm. This
is the worst way in the world to attempt to put him
down.

   A<small>MERICAN</small> C<small>RITICISM ON</small> D<small>ICKENS'</small> N<small>OTES</small>.—With
some very few and very silly exceptions, the whole
American newspaper press is out, hot and heavy, on
“Charles Dickens, Esq.” for the ignorance, bad
grammar, bad logic, and bad heart, exhibited in his
<i>brochure</i> on this country. Mr. Ritchie, one of the
oldest and most amiable and kind hearted of Ameri-
can editors, speaks as follows:—
<m9>   We have read the work with disappointment, regret,
much disgust, and we must add, some indignation. We
expected from Mr. Dickens's talents, and the professions
of gratitude he evinced, a much better production—more
just in its views of American society—more liberal in its
temper—more worthy of him and of ourselves. We had
admired many of his works—and we confess, liked the
man. But the present production will lose him friends in
America. It will circumscribe the range of his future
productions. It will nearly cut off the whole region of
the south, once his most ardent admirers, from the circle
of his readers. It will weaken the moral force of all his
	...
other subjects. We agree with “Nile's Register,” that
“the work will sadly lower the estimate in which the
author was held—both as a writer and a man—although
there are many well written and some wholesome para-
graphs in it.” There are some spirited sketches in it, of

He had leisure and bad taste enough to witness <a title="young negro, who is the wit of the assembly, and the greatest dancer known" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=onI-WL7FpTAC&pg=PA36">a negro
dance at the Five Points</a>. He had condescended to give a
full and silly account of it. He can stoop to the low and pro-
tracted dialogue with a negro stage driver who drove him
from the Potomac to Fredericksburg. He has found time
to describe <i>con amore</i> the hogs of New York and of Louis-
ville—the coarser manners of his <u title="fellow">follow</u> passengers on
canal boats and steamers. And yet he had no taste for de-
scribing the distinguished men whom he saw at Washing-
ton and in the north. Let any one read his whole western
tour, from his leaving Richmond to his arrival at Niagara,
being one fourth of his book, and then say how many
grains of wheat he can collect in all this bushel of chaff.—
Except a very few facts which he has given us in his ac-
count of Cincinnati and St. Louis, almost the whole pas-
sage might be spared, without the slightest loss to the
beauty or the value of his “Notes.”</m9>

visited him in the morning, and remained some time in
earnest conversation and prayer. The result of the mis-
sion of the gentlemen of the Bar who went to Albany on
Tuesday afternoon, with the proceedings of the meeting,
will probably be made known this morning, as they must
have left Albany in yesterday afternoon's boat. There is
but one expression relative to the <u>imprecedented</u> course of
those concerned in this meeting, and that is astonishment
and surprise that such proceedings could be countenanced

			<b>Case of Colt.</b>
   We present below the official opinion of Govern-
or Seward, refusing to grant a respite to Colt on the
application of the members of the New York bar,
who took part in the meeting in the Superior Court
Room on Tuesday. It is addressed to Sheriff
Hart, and will be found conclusive.
   We understand that a second application has been
made to the Chancellor, by the prisoner's counsel,
to grant a writ of error, backed by the opinion of
Benjamin F. Butler, Esq. and Joseph C. Hart, the
counsel of the sheriff.
   The answer of the Chancellor will be received by
the Albany boat that arrives to-morrow morning, at
about day light. This is the only hope left the pri-
soner for the stay of execution.
   He was quite cheerful this morning, until his mis-
tress, Caroline Henshaw, visited him for the first
time since his sentence, when the recollections of
past and anticipations of future appeared to pros-
trate all his physical faculties.

   James T. Brady, Richard R. Ward, <u title="H. Wharton (elsewhere)">R. Wharten</u> Griffith,
and Samuel G. Raymond, Esqrs, counsellors <u title="at (elsewhere)">of</u> law, have
submitted to the Governor resolutions passed yesterday at
a meeting of members of the legal profession in the city
of New York, asserting that the right to review the de-
cisions of inferior tribunals in the Court of last resort is a
right so essential to the due administration of the laws,

   The Governor is informed by a communication which
accompanies the resolutions that the meeting was nume-
rous and was convened to take into consideration the case
	...
   Samuel Adams, a citizen of this State, was found dead
	...
   The presiding Judge then allowed a writ of error, not
from any distrust of the <u title="decision (elsewhere)">decisions</u> which the Court
had pronounced, but from solicitude to avoid every possi-
ble error in so grave a case, and from a becoming deference
to higher tribunals; and in the mean time the judgment le-
gally consequent on the verdict was delayed. The record
was submitted to the Supreme Court and after a careful
examination of the case, and hearing counsel who main-
tained the objections of the accused, that high tribunal
unanimously declared that no error had been committed
by the Court of Oyer and Terminer and that the objec-
tions were not merely groundless but <i>frivolous</i>. The re-
	...
   Writs of error in capital cases are not writs of right, but
are writs of grace, and they are rendered so for the obvi-
ous reason that crime would flourish over the community,
and society be shaken to its foundations if every offender
was allowed to procrastinate the punishment denounced
against his crime, by appeals without grounds and without
reason from court to court until final judgment should be
rendered in the <u title="Court for the Correction of Errors (elsewhere)">court for the correction of errors</u>—a tribu-
nal constituted not to hinder justice by drawing all the
proceedings of all other courts, whether probably right

   The sentiments expressed in the resolutions of the mem-
bers of the Bar and the address of their Committee, have
been considered with the respect justly due to those who
united in the meeting as members of an enlightened pro-
fession, and as patriotic and enlightened citizens; and it
remains only to announce that the Governor is still of the
opinion that the course of legal proceedings in regard to
the offender, has been regular and humane; that exposi-
tions of the Constitution and laws by the Supreme Court
are binding on the Executive and all other authorities, if
not <u title="inconsistent">inconvenient</u> with adjudications of the Court for the
Correction of Errors; that no abuse of power or discretion
has been committed by the judicial officers in the case of
John C. Colt, and that to put forth the pardoning power
under the circumstances in which it is now solicited,
would be not only inconsistent with the equality which
ought always to govern its exercise, but would be subver-
sive of law and public order.

<l9>			——
OPINION OF THE CHANCELLOR UPON THE AP-

   ERROR.		——
		John C. Colt,			}
			vs.				} Nov. 3, 1842.
The People of the State of New-York.	}
   T<small>HE</small> C<small>HANCELLOR</small>. This is an application on
the part of John C. Colt, who has been convicted
of the crime of murder, for the allowance of a
writ of error to the Court of Oyer and Terminer
	...
testimony of Dr. Rogers, however, is that the</l9>
<d>[Col.3]</d>
<l9>corner of the hatchet's edge, if held by a person
standing in front of the deceased while he was on
his feet, exactly fitted the hole in the skull. And
as the skull and the hatchet were placed together
before the jury, they could, of course, see wheth-
er he was correct; as it required no surgical skill
to see that the corner of the hatchet filled the
hole with the handle towards the face.
   As the statute uses the words “by accident and
misfortune, and not done in a cruel or unusual
manner,” in defining excusable homicide, I do
not see how any one can doubt the correctness of
the judge's charge in telling the jury that those
expressions were not to be rejected as <u title="surplusage">surplussage</u>

gether. Having therefore arrived at the conclu-
sion that there is no probable cause for supposing
that there is any error in the judgment in this
case, nor any reason to doubt that the prisoner
has been properly convicted, if the jury came to
a correct conclusion upon the question of fact
which it belonged to them exclusively to decide,
I must do, as the Justices of the Supreme Court
have done, refuse to allow this writ of error.</l9>

<d>[Col.4]</d>
		CASE OF COLT.
			——
   We are enabled to give to-day, the opinion
of Chancellor W<small>ALWORTH</small>, on the application
on the part of Colt, for the allowance of a writ
of error to the court of oyer and terminer in
the city of New-York, to remove the record
into the Supreme Court, and ultimately into the
Court of Errors. The opinion is in the usual
able manner of that distinguished jurist, and
will be read with much interest. This, and the
able opinion of gov. S<small>EWARD</small>, cover the whole
ground, and it may be supposed would have
disposed of the question. But we understand
that a committee of the bar of the city of New-
York, appointed at a meeting in that city on
Tuesday morning, waited upon the Governor
yesterday, and urged a review of his opinion,
and a reprieve of Colt until his case could be
reviewed by the Court of Errors. We can ap-
preciate the delicacy of the Governor's position,
and the regret which he may well experience
in being called to the discharge of this most un-
pleasant and responsible duty. But it is due to
him to say, that thus far he has brought to the
task a most commendable firmness, along with
a proper appreciation of the condition of the
prisoner, the appeals of his friends, and the due
administration of justice.

   <i>American Notes for General Circulation, by Charles
Dickens</i>.—We did intend to write a review of this
book; but upon a second reading of it, cannot resist
the conclusion that both book and author, are alike
unworthy of serious notice.
   Mr. D<small>ICKENS</small> is a young man who knows nothing
of the world, of society, or of Government, but what
he picked up in his capacity of a “flash Reporter”
and penny-a-liner when connected with some of the
most <u title="scurrilous">scurrillous</u> of the vile Presses with which Lon-
don abounds; and no person of ordinary intelligence
can get up from the perusal of these “Notes,” with-
out feeling that the great aim of the writer is to pro-
duce the impression among English readers, that he
is really <i>somebody</i>, and possesses all those niceties of
feeling and sensitiveness of contact with the vulgar
mass, so frequently assumed by the low-bred scul-
lion unexpectedly advanced from the kitchen to the
parlour.
   That Mr. D<small>ICKENS</small> has written of late years
much to admire, we freely admit; but we deny
that he is in any way conversant with the habits,
thoughts, feelings, or intercourse of gentlemen.—
Of this he is himself conscious; and therefore it
is, that we find every page of his “Notes” filled
with commentaries upon the manner—the disgust-
ing manner, in which our people eat, drink and
sleep! With the exception of the few individuals
who did no honor to themselves or this country by
honoring him, we are all described as a dirty, filthy,
gormandizing race, almost beneath the contempt of
<i>such</i> and Englishman as C<small>HARLES</small> D<small>ICKENS</small>. That
same <i>Charles Dickens</i> who for more than half his life
has lived in the stews of London and eaten his daily
bred at “cold wittal” shops supplied from the re-
fuge garbage of hotels and the tables of gentlemen,
finds faults forsooth, with the humble fare and plain
but frugal habits and manner of hour industrial
classes. He who came among us on an impudent
speculative trip in relation to the Law of Copy-right,
complains that our people are fond of money! and
he whose love of dollars and cents prevented his
availing himself of the usual comfortable means of
travelling through our country, and forced him into
canal boats to be caged up for days in succession
among the starving emigrants from his own land,
sends forth <u title="piteous">pitious</u> cries of our want of comforts
in travelling, and complains of the associates among
whom his natural tastes and his niggardly penu-
riousness, prompted him to seek companionship!
   From Washington he went to Richmond via Fre-
dericksburg; and from this specimen of stage coach
travelling he presumes to form an opinion of that
mode of travelling throughout the country. In jour-
neying West he reaches <i>Harrisburg</i>; and here he
has three different modes presented to him of reach-
ing <i>Pittsburg</i>. First, he might have taken a Post
coach for himself, wife and servant, and been accom-
modated with continual relays of better horses than
he could find in similar employ in England. Then
again, there was the usual line of post and mail
coaches; and finally the <i>Canal Packet</i> crowded with
the honest but humble emigrants to the <i>far west</i>. Like
a true English penny-a-liner, he consulted his purse
instead of his comfort; and having discovered that
his ignorance and disregard of the common courte-
sies of life, had in all probability, ruined the <i>specula-
tion</i> which brought him to our shores, he very pru-
dently determined to take the <i>cheapest</i> mode of
travelling through the country; and of course, em-
barked on board a Canal Boat! There he was ne-
cessarily doomed to meet with a class of persons and
a description of fare and attendance, graduated to
the mode of travelling and the price paid; and from
what he then saw and experienced, he makes up his
“notes!”
   Now it so happened that we visited England in
1838, and on our arrival at <i>Bristol</i> found <i>three</i> differ-
ent modes presented to us of going to London—the
Rail-road being not then completed. The first was,
to <i>Post</i> it; the second, to go by the mail coaches,
and the third, to crawl inside of what is well known
to all who have ever travelled in England, as a V<small>AN</small>.
Let us suppose that we had taken the latter convey-
ance because it was the <i>cheapest</i>, and with a full
knowledge that we would have had for associates
beggars, thieves, and <i>vermin</i>, such as no foreigner
ever met with on board of an American Canal Boat,
and that from this company and this mode of con-
veyance, we had written an account of this as the
usual mode of travelling between Bristol and Lon-
don! We ask of the intelligent Englishmen among
us, what <i>they</i> would have said of our fairness or ve-
racity, if we had thus travelled, and from what we
thus saw and experienced, presumed to slander
a whole people?
   Yet this is precisely what Mr. D<small>ICKENS</small> has done in
relation to the United States; and to those who have
a taste for reviewing or meddling with such a pic-
ture of our people, we leave Mr. Boz—the inimitable
Boz—the glorious Boz—and his “notes for general
circulation.”
   His affected horror at American manners; his con-
tinual recurrence to his refined tastes and his supe-
rior cleanliness; and his repeated assurances that to
this day he cannot sleep without dreaming of the
shocks his too sensitive nerves experienced in this
country; might be excused or only laughed at, in a
young and effeminate scion of nobility who from the
cradle had experienced nothing but the most gentle
nurture, and who had never known a want but it
was anticipated by his countless servants in livery;
but for C<small>HARLES</small> D<small>ICKENS</small> to assume such airs—that
identical D<small>ICKENS</small> who for more than half his life
has been the daily associate and boon companion of
the poorest of the poor, and who has lived upon “the
crumbs which fall from the rich man's table”—is
disgusting and contemptible in the extreme.
   We therefore turn him over to the tender mercies
of his especial admirers, with the single remark that
his Book is the most <i>trashy</i> of all the publications
ever issued in relation to the United States, unadorn-
ed by a solitary evidence of the talent of those wri-
ters who have abused us with a hearty good will,
but who at the same time were capable of apprecia-
<d>[Col.2]</d>
ting what they saw, even when it was not their <i>in-
terest</i> fairly to represent it.

<d>[Col.4]</d>
   We find the following horrid details in an Iowa
paper, and it strikes us as it does one of our contem-
poraries, as the “most extraordinary and cruel rela-
tion of circumstances that ever went forth in type.”
<l9>   An old man lived alone, and had forbidden a daugh-

Griffith, and Samuel G. Raymond, Esq's, counsel-
lors <u title="of (elsewhere)">at</u> law, have submitted to the Governor reso-
	...</l9>

<l9>	...
   (<small>L. S.</small>			WILLIAM H. SEWARD.
   By the Governor,
   Henry Underwood, Private Secretary.</l9>
   We are apprized, of the persevering and un-
paralleled influence which, from all parts of the
State—nay, as we have heard, from almost <u>eve-</u>
State in the Union—has been brought to bear on the
Executive, in order to induce him to respite or par-
don Colt; and we can well conceive, that a more
painful duty could not be imposed upon a humane
man, than that of deciding, in such a case, for justice
rather than mercy, for the law and safety of so-
ciety, against the earnest arguments, entreaties, and
prayers of petitioners for the convict's life.
   But the Governor has decided, deliberately de-
cided, and we confess our opinion goes with him en-
tirely.
   In connection with this subject, we publish the
following communication; so far as it pur-
ports to state the fact connected with the meeting,
we believe it to be correct. But when it ascribes as
the motive for the interference of these members of
the bar “a desire to let loose on society a blood-
stained murderer,” it does great injustice to the gen-
tlemen who attended the meeting. Some of them
are our personal friends, and we <i>know</i> that their ac-
tion in the matter sprang from the conviction that
the legal rights of the convict had been denied, and
that, without any sympathy whatever with the crime
or the criminal, they felt it due to the character of the
profession, and as they conceived, to the common
interests of all, for all are interested in maintaining in-
violate the rights and privileges secured by the law
to every man, to make the effort they did to arouse
public attention to what they deemed so great a
wrong.
   We differ in opinion from them, but for their mo-
tives we have the highest respect, while we condemn
the meeting.
   It may not be amiss to add, that neither D. Gra-
ham, Esq, nor as far as we have heard, any other of
the Counsel of Colt, took part in the meeting. Mr.
Graham, we know, was not present.
<m9>   Mr. Editor—As a member of the bar, I must protest
against the profession's being held, in the slightest de-
gree, responsible for the proceedings of the meeting
lately held in reference to John C. Colt.
   That meeting was summoned by a call, not of the Bar,
but of those members of it who were opposed to certain
proceedings of the Courts in Colt's case.
   At the meeting no one was allowed to speak in sup-
port of those proceedings.
   There were present at the hour of meeting <i>eight</i> per-
sons, half an hour afterwards <i>twenty-eight</i>, and one hour
after <i>thirty-six</i>, who constituted the meeting, and passed
the resolutions “<i>unanimously</i>,”—unanimity not being of
very difficult attainment, when all opposition is silenced.
   These facts show that it is a gross libel <u title="on">as</u> the pro-
fession to call the meeting referred to, a meeting of the
bar; and that not the Bar, but those who got up the
meeting, and the thirty-six individuals (out of some ten
or eleven hundred,) who voted for the resolutions, are
responsible for this attempt to check the course of jus-
tice, by a recourse to popular excitement.
   For the laudable purpose of letting loose on society a
convicted murderer, with blood-stained hatched in hand,
they are willing to give whatever influence their profes-
sional standing may have, to the support of a proposi-
tion which would make every execution that has occur-
red in our city a murder under the forms of law, and re-
lease from our State Prisons every pest of society, who
is now suffering the well deserved penalty of the law,
through the agency of the Court of Oyer and Terminer.
   The humanity of these benevolent gentlemen is of
course too expanded to be confined to the solitary case
of Colt. While redressing the wrongs of the “victims
of society”, they will not forget much injured Mun-
roe Edwards, who, despoiled of his whiskers, and de-
graded to a base mechanical occupation, is now suffer-
ing the pangs of imprisonment through a sentence of the
same court. A meeting of those opposed to his righte-
ous sentence will no doubt be called, which will be quite
as well attended, and quite as much approved by the legal
profession as that which has been misnamed a meeting
of the									B<small>AR</small>.</m9>

   We understand the Counsel of Colt, have drawn
up their objections to the Chancellor's refusal to per-
mit the case to be carried up to the Court of Errors,
setting forth the law of the case as they view it—
that <i>Mr. B. F. Butler</i> has concurred in this opinion,
and written a letter to the Chancellor, advising him
to reconsider his decision.
   A messenger went up last evening to the Chan-
cellor at Albany, and will be back here tomorrow
morning.
   If the Chancellor yields—of course the Governor
will grant a reprieve.

   THE CASE OF COLT.—The Bar Meeting cal-
led in the city of New York, to make further efforts
to avert the sentence of law upon John C. Colt, was
attended by less than forty gentlemen, by whom a
committee was appointed to ask a respite from the
Governor, who has not, we understand, felt at lib-
erty to grant this request.

		<b>The case of John C. Colt.</b>
<l9>   This wretched man, the murderer of Samuel Ad-
ams, is to expiate his bloody crime upon the gallows
in the city of New York, to-morrow. Every con-
ceivable effort has been made, to turn aside the un-
relenting sword of justice. Appeals have been made
to every tribunal without success. A weak and
morbid sympathy has manifested itself in some
quarters from which better things should have been
expected. As a last resort, a powerful influence
was arrayed and brought to bear upon the Govern-
or, to induce him to pardon the culprit, or com-
mute his sentence. This the Governor has after
calm and deliberate investigation refused to do;
and he assigns the reasons for his decision in the
ablest paper that we ever have seen from his pen.</l9>

		<b>Case of John C. Colt.</b>
   The Committee appointed at a <a class="l" href="#American-1842-11-15">meeting</a> of mem-
bers of the Bar on Tuesday to proceed to Albany
and solicit the Governor to grant a reprieve to
Colt, for the purpose of giving him another chance
for a new trial, have done their errand, but with
no success. They waited on the Governor
on Wednesday, but could not move him. The
following in his answer to their representations:
<m9>				E<small>XECUTIVE</small> D<small>EPARTMENT</small>, }
					Albany, Nov. 16, 1842. }
   James T. Brady, Richard R. Ward, <u title="H. Wharton (elsewhere)">R. Wharten</u> Griffith,
and Samuel G. Raymond, Esqrs., counsellors <u title="at (elsewhere)">of</u> law, have
submitted to the Governor resolutions passed yesterday at
	...
   The sentiments expressed in the resolutions of the mem-
bers of the Bar and the Address of their Committee, have
been considered with the respect justly due to those who
united in the meeting as members of an enlightened pro-
fession, and as patriotic and enlightened citizens; and it re-
mains only to announce that the Governor is still of the
opinion that the course of legal proceedings in regard to
the offender has been regular and humane; that exposi-
tions of the Constitution and laws by the Supreme Court
are binding on the Executive and all other authorities, if
not inconsistent with adjudications of the Court for the Cor-
rection of Errors; that no abuse of power or discretion has
been committed by the judicial officers in the case of John
C. Colt, and that to put forth the pardoning power under
the circumstances in which it is now solicited, would be not
only inconsistent with the equality which ought always to
govern its exercise, but would be subversive of law and
public order.				WILLIAM H. SEWARD.

D<small>UDLEY</small> S<small>ELDEN</small> and R<small>OBERT</small> E<small>MMETT</small>, Esqrs., a
day or two since, prepared a long and elaborate
P<small>ROTEST</small> against the Execution of C<small>OLT</small>, addressed
to the Sheriff of the County. It was handed to us
for publication, and some 3,000 copies were struck
off; but it was finally suppressed through fear that
it might wear the semblance of an attempt to over-
awe the Sheriff in the discharge of his duty. These
copies were therefore sent to our country subscri-
bers, which will account for its having returned to
this city reprinted in other papers. We publish

		<b>The Execution of Colt.</b>
   This is the day appointed for the execution of
the wretched murderer of Samuel Adams. More
strenuous and persevering exertions to rescue him
from this fate than we have ever known in any
similar case have utterly failed of their intended
effect, and only serve to show the impotence of
all individual resistance to the power and majesty
of the Law. Colt, we understand, has requested
that the sentence may not be carried into effect
until sunset to-day; and as the Sheriff is disposed
to acquiesce so far as he can, consistently with a
strict discharge of his duty, in all reasonable re-
quests of the prisoner, we presume the execution
will not take place until that hour. An answer to
the application to the Chancellor to review his
former decision, and to grant a hearing of the case
before the Court of Errors, is expected from Al-
bany this morning; but of course no one expects a
reversal of his former opinion on the part of the
Chancellor. Colt appears subdued, and to some
degree penitent. He has steadily refused the at-
tendance of any clergyman except Dr. Anthon.
   Miss Henshaw, his former mistress, has visited
Colt several times during the past week; and a
consultation was held as to the propriety of their
being married—for the purpose, of course, of se-
curing the legal rights of herself and child. The
result is not well known outside the prison, though
it is most likely the ceremony was performed; it
is certain that it has been contemplated.

   <b>The Mary Rogers Mystery Explained.</b>
   The terrible mystery which for more than a
year has hung over the fate of Mary Rogers,
whose body was found, as our readers will well
<a class="l" href="#Tribune-1841-08-02">remember</a>, in the North River, under circum-
stances such as convinced every one that she was
the victim of hellish lust and then of murder, is at
last explained—to the satisfaction, we doubt not
of all. It may be recollected that associated with
the tale of her disappearance was the name of <a class="l" href="#Courier-1841-09-13">Mrs.
Loss</a>, the woman who kept the refreshment house
nearest the scene of her death. About a fortnight
since—<u title="When?">as we have already stated</u>—this woman
was accidentally wounded by the premature dis-
charge of a gun in the hands of her son; the wound
proved fatal; but before she died she sent for Jus-
tice Merritt, of New-Jersey, and told him the fol-
lowing facts. On the Sunday of Miss Rogers's dis-
appearance she came to her house from this city
in company with a young physician, who under-
took to procure for her a premature delivery.—
While in the hands of the physician she died and
a consultation was then held as to the disposal of
her body. It was finally taken at night by the son
of Mrs. Loss and sunk in the river where it was
found. Her clothes were first tied up in a bun-
dle and sunk in a pond on the land of Mr. James
G. King in that neighborhood; but it was after-
ward thought they were not safe there, and they
were accordingly taken and scattered through the
woods as they were found. The name of the phy-
sician is unknown to us, nor do we know whether
it was divulged or not. The Mayor has been made
acquainted with these facts by Mr. Merritt, and
we doubt not an immediate inquiry after the guilty
wretch will be made. The son of Mrs. Loss, as
an accessary after the fact, we suppose will be—if
he has not already been—arrested. No doubt, we
apprehend, can be entertained of the truth of this
confession. It explains many things connected
with the affair which before were wrapped in mys-
tery—especially the apathy of the mother of Miss
Rogers upon the discovery of her body. It will
be remembered that she did not even go to iden-
tify it and made no enquiries concerning the affair.
   Thus has this fearful mystery, which has struck
fear and terror to so many hearts, been at last ex-
plained by circumstances in which no one can fail to
perceive a Providential agency. Besides the guilty
murderer, the secret rested with two persons.
One of these, through the involuntary agency of the
other, is laid upon her death bed—and then Con-
science, no longer able to keep silence, breathes
its accusation into the ear of Justice. We rejoice
most deeply at this revelation, and that the scene
of the unhappy victim's death is relieved of some
of the horrors with which conjecture, apparently
well-founded, had surrounded it. If we recollect
aright <a class="l" href="#Herald-1841-08-17-2-Dr-Cook">some physicians</a> of this city testified with
great professional confidence as to the manner of her
death—describing very minutely the kind and de-
gree of personal violence to which she had been
subjected. <u title="These">There</u> statements are now shown to
be baseless. Should not this tend to diminish
somewhat the implicit reliance often placed upon
the testimony of physicians in similar cases?

notwithstanding the weather. Fair or foul the performance

<l9>			<b id="Tribune-1842-11-18-4-Afghanistan">Affghanistan.</b>
   We believe that Affghanistan has been but par-
tially known to the English themselves, till within
the last eight or ten years. Though the seat of
many great events in ancient periods of history,
it is now said to be inhabited by a wild and unciv-
ilized race. The mountain passes are filled <u title="with (elsewhere)">by</u>
robbers, and the mass of the population are fierce
and treacherous. The country that bears the gen-
eral name of Affghanistan is quite extensive, occu-
pying the greater part of the space between Hin-
dostan and Persia; being about eight or nine hun-
dred miles in length east and west, and five or six
hundred in breadth north and south. It is watered
by the Indus and its branches. The northern por-
tion is mountainous, and exhibits the variety of
climate within a small compass which is peculiar
to mountain regions. Caubul, or Cabool, or Ca-
bul, as it is differently spelled, and Jellalabad, or
Julalabad, between which the destruction of the
British army was effected, are near the northern
boundary. They are about ninety miles apart, al-
most in a line east and west upon Cabul river;
Cabul being farthest west and most elevated. Be-
tween the two, and about twenty-five miles west of
Jellalabad, is the boundary between the hot and
cold regions; the country thence becomes rough
and hazardous along the mountain passes, from
frost and snow during half the year, and from the
lawless and ferocious character of the population
at all times.
   Cabul is a noisy and bustling city, situated at an
elevation of 6,000 feet, or 11,000 as another au-
thority has it, above the level of the sea. It is a
place of great trade, and contains 60,000 inhabit-
ants. The natives say it is 6,000 years old, and
the popular belief is that when Satan was cast out
of Heaven he fell in Cabul. The snow lasts for
five months of the year, but the remainder of the
season is delightful, and the fruits and flowers are
abundant. The passes between this city and Jel-
lalabad are occupied by predatory bands of moun-
taineers.
   Jellalabad is a dirty town, with a regular popu-
lation of 2,000 residents; but in the cold season
the people flock to it from the surrounding villa-
ges. Between that town and Cabul is the mount
of Noorgill, or Kooner, covered with perpetual
snow, on which the <u title="Affghans (elsewhere)">Affghanistans</u> believe the ark
of Noah to have rested after the deluge. Not ma-
ny miles distant the natives point out the tomb of
Lamech, the father of Noah.
   The Affghans call themselves “Beni Israel,”
children of Israel, yet consider the term Jew to
be one of reproach. They say they were <u title="transplanted (elsewhere)">transla-
ted</u> by <u title="Nebuchadnezzar (elsewhere)">Nebadhadnezzar</u>, after the overthrow of
the temple, to the neighborhood of <u title="Bameean (elsewhere)">Bemeean</u> a
town west of Cabul, and lived as Jews till they
were converted to <u title="Mahommedanism (elsewhere)">Mohammedism</u>. They have
all the appearance of Jews, and retain the Hebrew
custom of the younger brother marrying the widow
of the elder. The question of their descent is,
however, considered a doubtful one.
   Shah Shooja, whose name is conspicuously men-
tioned in the newspaper accounts of the massa-
cre, is the uncle of Shah Kamraun, an Affghan
monarch, having his capital at Herat, nearer the
borders of Khorassan. This Kamraun, some years
since, put to death his Vizier, Futteh Khan, in a
fit of jealousy. Upon this the brothers of the Vi-
zier rebelled, and succeeded in gaining possession
of <u title="the greater (elsewhere)">a great</u> part of the Affghan empire. British
troops were now introduced into the country.—
Their alliance was courted by Shah Kamraun, a
prince as weak as cruel, or by his uncle Shah
Shooja, and the proposed object has been to resist
the just indignation of the brothers of the Vizier
and to reinstate the authority of the ancient mon-
arch. Candahar, a city with about 60,000 inhab-
itants, situated southeast from Herat and south-
west from Cabul, and about equally distant from
each city, is one of the principal places posses-
ed by the brothers. Cabul was another of their
cities.
   In 1828 this country was penetrated by a Brit-
ish gentleman named Stirling, who gave it as his
opinion that a European army would meet with in-
superable difficulties in attempting to invade the
Affghan territories. Our facts chiefly gained
from the notes of <u title="Lieutenant Burnes (elsewhere)">Lieut. Burns</u>, who made a sim-
ilar journey two or three years afterward.

	<f12>THE CASE OF JOHN C. COLT.</f12>
    The annexed able, calm and dispassionate com-
munication is given to the public by Governor Se-
ward, in reply to the recent extraordinary applica-
tion from certain lawyers of this city, for a suspen-
sion of the execution of the sentence of John C. Colt
	...
   One only chance yet remains for him. We under-
stand the counsel of Colt have drawn up their ob-
jections to the Chancellor's refusal to permit the
case to be carried up to the Court of Errors, and
that these objections are supported in writing by
the opinions of Mr. B. F. Butler and the counsel
of the Sheriff. The whole was sent by a special
messenger on Wednesday to the Chancellor; this
messenger will no doubt return by the boat which
arrives this morning. We shall endeavor to ascer-
tain what tidings he brings and give their purport in
a postscript. If the Chancellor should yield, it is
probable the Governor will grant a reprieve.
   Colt himself we understand is tolerably calm and
collected. Caroline Henshaw, the female with whom
he cohabited, visited him yesterday and he was much
agitated by her presence, but afterwards regained his
apparent fortitude. The Rev. Mr. Anthon has con-
tinued to visit him.
   We also copy below from the Newark Daily Ad-
vertiser, some extracts from the protest, which the
Counsel of Colt have served on the Sheriff, against
executing the sentence of the Court.
   Colt has expressed a wish to the Sheriff that the
execution of his sentence should be delayed to the
last possible moment, before the setting of the sun.

				——<a id="Courier-1842-11-18-Colts-Counsel-to-Sheriff"></a>
Protest of his counsel against the legal competency
   of the Court before which he was convicted, and
   of the warrant under which he is held subject to
   execution.
<l9>M<small>ONMOUTH</small> B. H<small>ART</small>, Esq., Sheriff of the City and
   County of New York:
   S<small>IR</small>—As the counsel of John C. Colt, who is now
lying under sentence of death for the alleged murder
of Samuel Adams, the undersigned would feel that
they had failed in the full performance of their duty to
their unfortunate client, were they to omit to call
your attention to the grave and more than doubtful
questions connected with the legality of the warrant
requiring you to execute the sentence upon the priso-
ner. In making this communication we design dis-
tincltly to confine it to the question of legal duty and
responsibility on your part in the premises, disclaim-
ing on the one hand any intention to deter you from
the performance of your painful duty, if you are le-
gally bound to perform it, and resolved on the other
to afford the prisoner the benefit of every right which
may yet remain to him.
   The warrant by which you are directed to execute
the prisoner is as follows:
   [After reciting the warrant, signed by Judge Kent,
and Ald. Purdy and Lee, they proceed to reason the
case through what would occupy three columns, and
conclude as follows:]
   The whole case, then, resolves itself into this—that
the sheriff is justifiable in inflicting the punishment
of death only in obedience to the judgment of a com-
petent Court, and under a warrant to be signed by the
members of such Court; that the warrant in the pre-
sent case has been issued by an unconstitutional and
illegal, or at the most, very doubtful authority, and
that if its legality cannot be sustained upon its face,
it will afford no protection to the sheriff in its execu-
tion.
   The undersigned regret that, by what they believe
to be the unwise, if not illegal refusal to the prisoner,
of an opportunity to present the grave questions here
discussed to the judicial tribunals of the country,
whose decision would have protected the rights of the
prisoner on the one hand, and of the sheriff on the
other, a refusal for which they were not prepared in
a case presenting questions so grave and doubtful,
and involving consequences so awful as the present,
they have been constrained by an imperious sense of
duty to their client, to present to the sheriff the views
which they deliberately entertain of the solemn re-
sponsibility he is called upon to assume.
   If, under any circumstances, they could have hesi-
tated in the performance of this duty, they are re-
lieved from embarrassment, in the present instance,
by the fact that, if the necessary time for the exami-
nation of the question by the sheriff or his legal ad-
visers, should carry the execution of the warrant <u>be
yond</u> the day fixed for that purpose, the ends of pub-
lic justice if they require a victim in the person of the
prisoner, cannot be defeated by the delay. It is pro-
vided by the revised statutes that “<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=c0owAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA548">whenever</a>, for
any reason, any convict sentenced to the punish-
ment of death shall not have been executed pursuant
to such sentence, and the same shall stand in full
force, the Supreme Court, on the application of the
Attorney General, or of the district attorney of the
county where the conviction was had, shall issue a
writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, to bring such convict before
such Court, or, if he be at large, a warrant may be is-

   <i>Murder of Mary C. Rogers</i>.—Reports have been in
circulation for some days past, that discoveries have
been made as to the manner in which this unfortu-
nate female came to her death. They rest on the
following circumstances. On Saturday last we
gave a <a class="l" href="#Courier-1842-11-12-Col6">report of an inquest</a> which had been held
by Justice Gilbert Merritt, of Hudson county, act-
ing Coroner, on the body of Mrs. Frederica Loss,
who has for some years past been keeper of the
Nick Moore House, at the foot of Weehawken
Hill, and who came to her death by the accidental
discharge of a gun held in the hands of one of
her sons. This woman—who, it will be recol-
lected was examined at the time of finding the
corpse, as to any information she might possess of
the causes of the poor girl's death—it is said, before
she died, charged her two sons to make known the
circumstances attending the death of Mary Rogers,
which she had before concealed. These two sons,
we are informed were yesterday arrested at Hacken-
sack. We give these reports without vouching for
their accuracy, although we are inclined to believe they
are not without foundation.

on board either of the Boats from Albany this morn-

   T<small>HE</small> E<small>XECUTION OF</small> C<small>OLT</small>.—This day, between
the hours of 10 and 12 M., is the time appointed
for the execution of the unfortunate J. C. Colt.—
Every obstacle that has been raised by the inde-
fatigable exertions of his friends to avert the
consummation of the dread sentence of the law,
has been swept away by the firmness and inflexi-
ble decisions of the Chief Magistrate of the State,
	...
   Notwithstanding all this, however, there is a
broad and strong current of feeling, in this com-
munity, against taking the life of Colt, by hang-
ing, at this time, and under existing circumstan-
ces. A large share of this feeling arises from the
very general and growing repugnance to capital
punishment which exists among our fellow citi-
zens, and which is fast extending itself through-
out the land. The possibility that the death of
Adams was the result of a violent encounter in
which the victim might have been equally to
blame with his unhappy victor, strengthened as
that possibility is—(till it almost amounts to a
<i>probability</i> in the minds of many)—by the elabo-
rate opinion of many of our most eminent medi-
cal and surgical practitioners, <a class="l" href="#Sun-1842-11-14-Col6">published in our co-
lumns</a> a few days since, and by other known facts
and reasonable presumptions, has also added
greatly to the originally very limited number who
<s>????????????????????????????????????????</s>
this feeling, that we are morally certain that
should some circumstance yet arise which would
at least for a time delay the awful consummation
of sentence, and afford the unfortunate man fur-
ther time and opportunity to vindicate himself
from the imputation of <i>wilful murder</i>, and avert
the doom attached to that imputation, the pub-
lic mind in this city would experience a
most welcome relief. With a view to obtain for
him such respite and opportunity, his counsel,
we learn, on Wednesday evening despatched a
messenger to the Chancellor, at Albany, with an
able and learned series of objections to the Chan-
cellor's refusal to permit the case to be carried <u>up
the</u> Court of Errors, setting forth the law of the
case as they view it; and that <i>Mr. B. F. Butler</i>
has concurred in this opinion, and written a letter
to the Chancellor, advising him to reconsider his
decision. The return of the messenger is expect-
ed by this morning's boat from Albany. If the
Chancellor yields, of course the Governor will
grant a reprieve.
   In the mean time, Colt has, we are informed,
applied himself diligently to a spiritual prepara-
tion for the expected close, with him, of all things
temporal, to-day; and to a resignation to his im-
pending fate.

Yesterday morning's mail from Albany brought
Gov. Seward's Reply to the resolutions passed at
a meeting of some of the members of the Bar of
this city, a few days since; and the importance of
the document as an exposition of the legal conside-
rations involved in the subject of the reply, as well
as the intense and all-absorbing interest which per-
vades all classes of the community on the subject, re-
quires its general publication. Whatever diver-
sity of opinion may exist in the public mind as to
the righteousness of the sacrifice to be made to-
day to the outraged laws, we think none will deny
that both in his decision upon the application
made to him for an interposition to executive
clemency in behalf of Colt, and in this Reply,
Gov. Seward has exhibited himself in a light, both
as a magistrate and a lawyer, which does him
infinite credit. It is impossible for an unprejudiced
and candid mind to arrive at any other conclusion
upon a perusal of these documents.

			CASE OF COLT.
   The opinion of Gov. Seward, refusing to reprieve
or respite John C. Colt, who is sentenced to be exe-
cuted in New York, <i>to-day</i>, for the murder of Sam-
uel Adams, is too long for insertion in our paper.—
In another column, however, will be found a brief
extract from the concluding portion of it, and which
we commend to the reader. The opinion of the
Governor is a dispassionate, able, and to our mind,
conclusive argument on the merits of the case.—
We appreciate fully the responsibility and delicacy
of the Governor's position, and we are not disposed
to withhold the expression of our approbation, of the
integrity and firmness with which he has discharged
his duty. We are not able to call to mind an in-
stance of any importance, in which we are disposed
to find fault with Gov. Seward in the disposition of
the cases submitted to him for the exercise of the par-
doning power. Whatever opinion may be enter-
tained of his political conduct and measures, he is
nevertheless, entitled to the approbation of the Peo-
ple for the tender regard for the efficacy and suprem-
acy of the Laws, and the firmness with which he has
exercised the executive power of pardon.
   After the refusal of the reprieve to Colt, a meeting
of a small and not very distinguished portion of the
Bar of New York, met, and among other things
deputed a committee to wait upon Gov. Seward, and
ask for a reprieve of Colt until the Court of Errors
might decide as to the legal competency of the
Court that tried him: it being alleged that the Court
was illegally constituted inasmuch as two <i>Aldermen</i>
were associated with the Circuit Judge during the
trial. It is understood the reprieve was denied by
the Governor, and, we think, very properly.

   P<small>REPARATIONS FOR</small> E<small>XECUTION</small>.—H<small>IS INTENDED</small>
M<small>ARRIAGE</small>.—A<small>TTEMPTED</small> B<small>RIBERY</small>.—The execution
of Colt will in all probability take place this day.
The only prospect or hope of respite is, that the
Chancellor, who is now at Albany, will grant a
writ of error on the second application of prisoner's
counsel, backed by the opinion of Benjamin F.
Butler, Esq., and the Sheriff's counsel, Joseph C.
Hart, Esq. A messenger was sent to Albany on
Wednesday evening for that purpose, who will re-
turn by the boat this morning. It is supposed, that
if the Chancellor consents, which is not very proba-
ble, that Governor Seward will grant a reprieve, in
order to allow the case to come before the Court of
Errors.
   The counsel of prisoner have presented to Sheriff
Hart a protest against the legal competence of the
Court of Oyer and Terminer, in which they deny
the constitutional power of the Court with an Alder-
man sitting as one of the Judges. The Sheriff is a
ministerial officer only, and must obey the order of
the Court, without any discretion on his part as to
consequences.
   Colt's mistress, Caroline Henshaw, visited him in
his cell yesterday for the first time since his sen-
tence, and on Colt's proposition, they were to have
been married during the morning, but owing to the
interposition of some of his friends, the ceremony
was not performed, although it is expected that it
will take place this morning. Their child was not
with her, and we believe Colt has never seen it.
She has recently resided in Philadelphia, where
the child now remains.
   From rumors that have been quietly in circulation
in certain circles for the past few weeks, we have
had reason to believe that a most extended system
of bribery had been in operation to effect the escape
of Colt, and last evening ascertained that the sum
of $1000 had been offered to each of three of the
deputy keepers of the City prison, provided
they would connive at the escape of Colt by allow-
ing him to dress himself in the clothes of Caroline
Henshaw, his mistress, who would be sent into his
cell for that purpose. It was this disclosure that
prompted Col. Jones to place Colt in irons, and
which, on their being removed, induced the sheriff
to put him in charge of two of his deputies. The
deputy keepers of the prison communicated the
proposition made them to the principal keeper as
soon as the corrupt motive was made apparent.—
The whole affair, together with the authors of the
bribery, will be exposed after the execution.
   It has been supposed by many that Colt would
commit suicide before the day of execution, and a
few day since he sent for Dr. <u title="McComb">Macomb</u>, physician
of the prison, and requested to borrow some medi-
cal work on anatomy, which was refused. He then
made a number of serious enquiries as to the loca-
tion of the large veins and arteries of the body, evin-
cing a disposition to ascertain at which particular
point death would be the most easy and effectually
produced.
   Since the decision of the Governor, as read to him
on Sunday, he has not evinced any of that dare-
devil recklessness of spirit that existed before, and
under the influence and counsel of the Rev. Dr.
Anthon, has appeared to have been partially re-
signed to his fate, and given demonstrations of pre-
parations for the future.
   The answer of Governor Seward to the applica-
tion of a portion of the members of the New York
Bar, was first communicated to him yesterday mor-
ning, by Dr. Anthon, and afterwards confirmed by
the sheriff, accompanied by his counsel, Joseph C.
Hart, Esq. He evinced much feeling on the recep-
tion of the final decision of the Governor, and
wept most bitterly. The last application of counsel
for a writ of error, the result of which will be made
known this morning, has not been communicated to
him, and he therefore gave up all hopes of pardon or
respite when the decision of the Governor was com-
municated to him yesterday morning.
   The gallows was taken into the prison yard last
evening, and will be erected early this morning in
the rear avenue, and immediately opposite the
window of the cell in which he is confined.
   He made a request yesterday, that the execution
might be postponed until the last hour of day, as
Judge Kent had not specified any precise hours be-
tween which it should be carried into effect. Should
the Sheriff comply with this request, he will not be
executed until four o'clock in the afternoon.
   Deputy Sheriff Vultee, was selected by the Sheriff
to guard his cell last evening, in company with
deputy keeper Pierce. He remained in his cell
alone, his brother leaving him about dusk.
   The preparations to preserve order and quiet about
the city prison during the day, have been made by
that vigilant officer A. M. C. Smith, Esq., who has
selected under the direction of the Sheriff, thirty
officers to aid him in this arduous duty.
   The following is the official opinion of Governor
Seward addressed to Sheriff Hart, in reply to the
application for respite of the members of the New
York Bar, convened in the Superior Court Room on
Tuesday last:—

opinion that the course of legal proceedings in regard to

are binding on the Executive and all other authorities, if
not inconsistent with adjudications of the Court for the
Correction of Errors; that no abuse of power or discretion
has been committed by the judicial officers in the case of
John C. Colt, and that to put forth the pardoning power
under the circumstances in which it is now solicited,
would be not only inconsistent with the equality which
ought always to govern its exercise, but would be subver-
sive of law and public order.

			<b>Colt's Execution.</b>
   The preparations for the execution of John C. Colt
were all made at an early hour this morning.
   The messenger sent to Albany returned this morn-
ing, with the information that the Chancellor had
peremptorily refused to grant a writ of Error on the
second application of the counsel of Colt. Senator
Verplanck has also replied to a letter of Colt's coun-
sel in which he agrees with the position taken by
Benjamin F. Butler, Esq. counsel of the Sheriff,
who backed the last application to the Chancellor,
for the purpose of having the question of Aldermen
setting as Judges of the Court of Oyer and Terminer,
constitutionally decided.
   Colt was engaged in writing nearly all night, pre-
paring, as we understand, a full confession of all ap-
pertaining to the murder of Adams. He was under
the charge of Deputy Sheriff Vultee and Green, du-
ring the night. And upon being asked during the
evening if he wanted anything, he desired a cup of
coffee, and then told the Deputy that he wished to
see all the keepers of the prison between 12 and 1
o'clock this day, when he would bid them adieu
forever. He also stated that the Sheriff had com-
plied with his request, and postponed the hour of
execution until the last of the day, as published in
the Herald this morning. It will not take place
therefore before four o'clock, which will be too late
for our second edition.
   Colt's brother was at the prison door as soon as it
was opened in the morning, and remained with him
about a quarter of an hour.
   The Rev. Dr. Anthon had not visited him at ten
o'clock this morning.
   He afterward dressed himself and was shaved by
Bill <u title="Dolsen, Dolson (elsewhere)">Dolsens</u>, of Centre street, commonly called Deaf
Bill.
   At early dawn persons began to assemble around
the City Prison, and at about 8 o'clock, the avenues
and entrances began to be blocked up with anxious
enquirers, who were asking—“Will he be hung?”
—“Can't you let us in?” &c. The gates to the en-
trance of the prison were closed about eight o'clock,
and officers stationed under the charge of A. M. C.
Smith, to prevent the ingress of any except those
who had tickets of admission.
   The position of the gallows was in the rear court
yard of the prison, and the noise of the workmen in
its erection could be distinctly heard through the
massive walls of the prison.
   The gallows was erected early in the morn-
ing. It consisted merely of two upright posts,
and one <u title="transversely">transversly</u> placed. Through the centre of
the transverse piece, over a <u title="pulley">pully</u> wheel, the rope
was passed, and to the opposite end weights of about
230 pounds were suspended by additional blocks
and tackle. It was placed in the centre of the yard,
and immediately opposite the rear window of the
cell in which Colt was confined.
   At 9 o'clock the outer door of his cell was opened
and the usual breakfast of the prisoners served up in
the different cells to the prisoners. The sliding of
locks, bolts and bars, and the chit chat and excite-
ment among the inmates of the prison as well as the
spectators that had been admitted, all tended to add
a peculiarity to the scene within the walls of the
Tombs that must be ever remembered to all who
were present. Nothing was talked of, hinted at or
thought about but the execution, the execution,
which to the ears of Colt, if he could catch the
sound, must have been aught but agreeable.
   The excitement about the prison was intense at
about 11 o'clock, and the doors of the Police Office
were closed in order to prevent the intrusion of the
crowd.
   Franklin street was filled with the multitude
as well as the vestibule of the city prison on Centre
street, and the street in front.
   Dr. Anthon visited the cell of Colt at about 11
o'clock, in company with Colt's brother, for the
purpose of making preparation for his marriage with
Caroline Henshaw.
   At about half past 11 o'clock Messrs. Graham and
<u title="Emmet">Emmitt</u>, his counsel, visited his cell and remained
about half an hour. A little before 12 o'clock, Caro-
line Henshaw made her appearance in company
with the brother of Colt and John Howard Payne,
who entered the cell with her. They were then
married by the Rev. Dr. Anthon, in presence of Da-
vid Graham, Robert Emmett, Justice Merritt, the
Sheriff, John Howard Payne, and <u title="Colt's (in Herald-1842-11-19)">his</u> brother. She
was dressed with a straw bonnet, green shawl, a
claret colored cloak trimmed with red cord, and a
muff. Her appearance denoted much anxiety, and
she was much thinner than when a witness on the
trial.
   After their marriage, Dr. Anthon remained in the
cell with them a few minutes and then left them
alone, she remaining for nearly an hour.
   There was considerable excitement among the
prisoners in the various cells, and Sears, who is
confined for the murder of McDonough, was ex-
ceedingly inquisitive as to all the preparations for
the execution. It may be his turn next. The pri-
soners in the upper cells, the windows of which
overlook the rear court yard, where the gallows
was erected, contrived to get a view of the scene by
holding a piece of looking glass out of the small
apertures in the side of the cell, the reflection of
which brought it to their sight. From every cell an
arm could be seen with a piece of glass in the fingers,
evincing that the holder was anxiously waiting for
the hour of execution, which will take place at
about half past three o'clock. It is now half past
twelve, and, in accordance with his request, the
keepers of the prison will take a last farewell.
   His wife, Caroline Henshaw, now Caroline Colt,
is still in the cell alone with him.
   Dudley Selden, one of his counsel, has just entered
the prison.
   Colt has been engaged for the past two days in
writing a reply to the letter of Gov. Seward.
   It is now one o'clock, and Colt has just ordered a
quart of hot coffee, which has been brought in and
himself and wife are drinking it.
   The following is the letter of the Chancellor in
reply to the second application of Colt's counsel for
a writ of error. It is addressed to Joseph C. Hart,
Esq., the counsel of the sheriff, and we present an
exclusive copy:—
<m9 id="Herald-1842-11-18-2-eve-Chancellor">					A<small>LBANY</small>, Nov. 17, 1842.
D<small>EAR</small> S<small>IR</small>—
   I heard the questions upon the writ of error in Colt's
case, argued at great length at New-York, and came to the
deliberate determination that there was none of them on
which there was any room to doubt, as you will see from
my written opinion, which I left in the hands of Colt's
counsel when I left New-York, and which is now pub-
lished in the Argus of this morning. You will therefore
see that it is out of my power to violate my oath of office
by allowing a writ of error in the case, even if the appli-
cation was now regularly before me on an application up-
on notice to the Attorney General. Neither would the al-
lowance of the writ stay the execution of the sentence, as
I could not certify that there was a probable cause for
staying the proceedings, and the Governor would not in-
terfere without such certificate.
   I have never heard any lawyer, except the counsel for
the prisoner, express any doubt as to the legality of the
conviction before the court which tried him. Nor have I
been able to find any member of the Court of Errors who
would have voted to reverse the judgment on the ground
of the organization of the court. It is perfectly natural
that the friends of this unhappy man should endeavor if
possible to stay his execution, but their anxiety to pre-
serve his life cannot excuse the officers of justice in ma-
king the laws bend to their wishes; although the course
which has been pursued in this case has placed, not only
those officers, but the Governor, in most painful and try-
ing situations. The prisoner's counsel had the right to
apply to the Chancellor, the three justices of the Supreme
Court, or to any of the eight circuit judges, for the allow-
ance of a writ of error, and if any one of those twelve of-

   The preparations for the execution of John C. Colt

	...
   It is now one o'clock, and Colt has just ordered a
quart of hot coffee, which has been brought in and
himself and wife are drinking it.

   At this period of the eventful day, the scene was
exciting and thrilling in the extreme. Within that
narrow cell were the husband and wife, but just mar-
ried, yet bidding each other farewell for the last
time on earth, with the awful certainty that one
would be a lifeless corpse, and the other a widow,
before the setting of the sun that was then throw-
ing its rays into the otherwise cheerless place. At
the door stood Vultee, the deputy sheriff, one hand
on the sliding bolt of the cell door, and the other
holding the padlock and key. On the corridor, con-
nected with his cell, was the sheriff, pacing up and
down on one side, evidently deeply affected with
the contemplation of the shocking ceremony he
was about to perform. Pacing up and down on the
other side of the corridor, might be seen a small
made man, with a highly intellectual countenance,
the natural brilliancy of which was overshadowed
by deep solemnity, his hands behind him, and his
whole mental energies evidently absorbed in profound
reflection on the things of another world; this was
Dr. Anthon the spiritual adviser of the prisoner.
Close by the little bridge which united the two cor-
ridors, stood two friends of the prisoner, in conver-
sation on his unfortunate career—these were John
Howard Payne, and Lewis Gaylord Clarke. In the
corridor below were about thirty persons, principally
those connected in some way or other with the ad-
ministration of justice; and on the faces of the
whole there was a most extraordinary aspect of so-
lemnity, altogether different from what has usually
been seen in that building, even just previous to an
execution. It appeared as if a terrible event was
about to happen that they could not avert, and that
would plunge them all in profound regret. At last,
about one o'clock, Colt's brother, Samuel, again
arrived, and entered his cell; he was still engaged
in conversation with his wife, who was sit-
ting on the foot of the bed, <u title="convulsed and in tears (in Tribune)">convulsed
with his tears</u>. At Colt's request, John Howard
Payne and Lewis Gaylord Clarke then went into
his cell to take their leave of him. Colt appeared
exceedingly pleased to see them; shook them cor-
dially by the hand, and conversed with apparent
cheerfulness with them for five minutes, when they
bid him farewell, both of them in tears. Colt's bro-
ther, Samuel, and his wife, remained in the cell
about ten minutes longer, when both left. His bro-
ther was deeply affected, and looked more ghastly
even than Colt himself. His wife could scarcely
support herself, so violent were her feelings and
acute her sufferings. She stood at the door of the
cell for a minute—Colt kissed her passionately—
strained her to his bosom, and watched her rece-
ding form as she passed into the corridor. Here she
stood and sobbed convulsively as though her heart
would break, for five minutes. At last she was led
away by Colt's brother, and his friends followed.—
He then desired to see the Sheriff, who went into
his cell. Colt then told him emphatically that he
was innocent of the murder of Adams, and that he
never intended to kill him; he also told him that he
still had hopes that something would intervene to
save him from being hung, and begged him not to
execute the sentence of the law upon him. The
Sheriff told him to banish all hope of that kind, for
that he must die at 4 o'clock. He then requested to
see the Sheriff's watch, and set his own by it to a
minute. He then asked to see Dr. Anthon, and
the latter went into his cell, and remained in
prayer with him for about ten minutes. At the close
of this, Colt again sent for the Sheriff, and said to
him, “If there are any gentlemen present who
wish to see me, and take their leave of me, I shall
be happy to see them.”
   This was announced by the Sheriff, and all pre-
sent with one or two exceptions passed up to his cell
door, shook him by the hand, and took their leave
of him. To one gentleman connected with the press
he said, “I've spoken <u title="harshly">harshlyly</u> of some of the
press, but I do not blame you at all; it was all my
own fault; there were things that ought to have
been explained<u title=", which were left unexplained; (in Herald-1842-11-19)">; </u>I know you have a good heart;
and I forgive you from my soul freely; may God
bless you and may you prosper.”
   He then requested his keeper, Mr. <u>Greene</u>, to let
him be left alone until the last moment. This was
about 2 P. M. His cell was closed and he was left
alone till 20 minutes to 3, when some friends of the
Sheriff <u title="apprehending (elsewhere)">apprehended</u> that he might attempt to com-
mit suicide, one of the Deputy <u title="Sheriffs (elsewhere)">Sheriff's</u>, Hillyer,
went to his cell door<u title=", and requested (in Herald-1842-11-19)">; I requested</u> to wish him “good
bye.” Colt was then walking up and down
his cell, but turned round on the door opening, smiled
on Hillyer, shook him by the hand, and kissed him,
as he did several of those who had just previously
bid him farewell in this life. He said to Hillyer—
“God bless you, and may you prosper in this life,
<d>[Col.5]</d>
which is soon to close on me.” From this time to
three o'clock, the excitement around the prison in-
creased tremendously; and the feelings of those in
the prison were also worked up to a pitch of great
intensity. Several eminent surgeons came into the
prison a little before three, and the universal topic of
discussion, all round, among the little knots of spec-
tators, was, whether he had been furnished with the
means, and whether he would commit suicide or
not. Many <u title="prophesied">prophecied</u> that “by four o'clock
there would be a dead man without hanging.”
			——
<f15 id="Herald-1842-11-18-extra-Colt-Suicide">SUICIDE OF JOHN C. COLT.</f15>
				Five minutes past 4, P. M.
   We had written the whole of the above at a ¼ to 3
P. M. this afternoon. At that time Colt was alive.
No one entered his cell till precisely 5 minutes to
four o'clock, at which time Sheriff Hart and Wes-
tervelt dressed in uniform with Dr. Anthon proceed-
ed to the cell, on the keeper opening the
door, Dr. Anthon who was first, drew back, threw
up his hands and eyes to Heaven, and uttering a
faint ejaculation, turned pale as death, and retired.
“As I thought,” said the keeper. “As I thought,”
said we. And going into the cell, there lay Colt
on his back, stretched out at full length
on the bed, quite dead, but not cold.
A clasp knife, like a small dirk knife, with a broken
handle, was sticking in his heart. He had stabbed
himself about the fifth rib on the left side. We felt
his temples, and they were warm. His vest was
open, the blood had flowed freely, and his hands,
which were placed across his belly, were very
bloody; he had evidently worked and turned
the knife round and round in his heart after he had
stabbed himself, until he made quite a large gash.—
His body was laid out quite straight on the bed as if
laid out for a funeral by others. His mouths was
open, and his eyes partly open. Dr. Hosack and
others went into his cell, and pronounced him dead.
   The Coroner was ready at hand, took charge of
the body, and locked the cell.
   Most strange to say, just at this moment, the large
cupola of the Tombs was discovered to be on fire;
and burned furiously; so that, if he had not killed
himself, in consequence of the execution being post-
poned to the last moment, it is very probable,
that in the confusion arising from the fire, and the
mob breaking into the Tombs, Colt would either
have made his escape, or he would not have been
hung.
   The conduct of those concerned needs no com-
mentary. The public will pass judgment on them!
We have more to say about his visitors hereafter.

   J. C. C<small>OLT</small>.—The boat from Albany this morning
brought no intelligence of the Chancellor's consenting
to reconsider his opinion. We learn that ano-
ther delegation waited upon the Governor yesterday,
urging a pardon; and that when he courteously but
firmly declined, they manifested rude and unbecom-
ing behaviour. We could not ascertain who and from
where these parties were.
   It is therefore a settled point that Colt will be ex-
ecuted today about 4 o'clock.
   The rumor that Colt was yesterday married to
Caroline Henshaw is unfounded, though it is re-
ported the ceremony was performed this morning.
   The Rev. Mr. Anthon, of the Episcopal Church,
is in attendance upon the prisoner.

   McD<small>ONALD</small> C<small>LARKE</small>.—The death of this poor wan-
derer along the high-ways and <u title="by-ways">bye-ways</u> of an un-
sympathizing world, and the melancholy circumstan-
ces by which it was attended, must be fresh in the
remembrance of our readers. It may be borne in
mind, too, that a private subscription was set on foot,
among a few of those kind-hearted friends who, while
he lived, were not wont to pass him by with cold in-
difference, for the purpose of erecting a modest tomb-
stone over his lonely grave. This monument is now
completed and in its place.
   The remains of poor Clarke were buried in the
Greenwood cemetery, some distance beyond Mount
Washington; but the trustees of the property having
<u title="generously given a resting place (Post-1842-11-19)">a generously given resting-place</u> for his mouldering
body, with permission to select the spot, it was exhum-
ed last week, and removed to a lovely little knoll, just
on the margin of the Sylvan Lake, and not far from the
“stranger's vault.” Here Clarke now lies, in the
midst of rural beauty such as would have called forth
the most rapturous strains of his distempered muse.
   The monument is simple, chaste and elegant. It
consists of a single block, square, resting upon a slab,
and supporting a truncated pyramid—the whole in
white marble, and having for its foundation a square
platform of granite.
   On the side of the block which meets the ap-
proaching spectator is a profile medallion of “the
mad poet,” in high relief—not a perfect likeness,
but yet a very good one. Beneath it are inscribed
the dates of his birth and death—June 18th, 1798,
and March 5th, 1842.
   On the next side is this inscription:—
<m9>		(Epitaph written by himself.)
			   SACRED
			To the Memory
				of
		POOR McDONALD CLARKE.
	Let silence gaze—but curse not his grave.
						McD. C.</m9>
   On the third side, facing the Sylvan Lake, are
four lines, selected from his own poetry:—
<m9>	But what are human plaudits now?
		He never deemed them worth his care.
	Yet Death has twined around his brow
		The wreath he was too proud to wear.</m9>
   On the fourth side are also four lines, written by
a friend:—
<m9>	By friendship's willing hand erected—
		By genius, taste and skill adorned—
	For one too long in life neglected,
		But now in death sincerely mourned.</m9>
   The monument is in excellent taste, and does
much credit to the sculptor, Mr. Battin.—[Com.

   We are requested to state, that the suggestion in
some of the papers, that Mr. B. F. Butler had ex-
pressed his concurrence in the objections contain-
ed in the Protest delivered to the Sheriff, against
the competency of the court by which the warrant
of execution, in the case of Colt, was issued, is er-
roneous. Mr. Butler was consulted by the Sheriff,
as to the course he should pursue in relation to
that protest, and in view of the painful and em-
barrassing position of that officer, and of other seri-
ous considerations connected with the matter, Mr.
Butler advised, that the application to the Chan-
cellor, for the allowance of the writ of error, should
be renewed; and he, as well as Mr. J. C. Hart, the
particular counsel of the Sheriff, wrote to the
Chancellor on the subject, expressing the hope,
that unless prevented by an imperative sense of
judicial duty, the writ might be allowed. The
reasons suggested in these letter, were those of
expediency merely. By this step, Mr. Butler ad-
vised, that the Sheriff had done all that humanity
required, or the public safety would permit, and
that it would be his duty, should the application
to the Chancellor be denied, to execute the process
in his hands, as to the validity of which, Mr. But-
ler expressed his decided concurrence with the
Chancellor and the Judges of the Supreme Court.
			—————
   J<small>OHN</small> C. C<small>OLT</small>.—This unfortunate and wretch-
ed man, who is doomed inevitably to die this day
by the hand of the public executioner, agreeably
to the sentence pronounced upon him by Judge
Kent, in accordance with the verdict of a jury, for
the wilful murder of Samuel Adams, yesterday was
visited in his drear and gloomy habitation by seve-
ral of his friends. Caroline Henshaw, the female
with whom he had cohabited for nearly two years,
was among the number. She paid him two visits
during the forenoon, and the interviews, from what
we could gather, were painful in the extreme. It
will be recollected that a child (a boy) was the
fruit of the illicit intercourse between this ill-fated
man and Caroline Henshaw, for the welfare of
whom the father, for the two or three last days,
has displayed the greatest anxiety.
   Much curiosity and interest was manifested
during the day, by a numerous assemblage col-
lected around the prison, to ascertain the correct-
ness of a report that, through the medium of his
minister, Dr. Anthon, he had become her hus-
band, and that the solemn compact of the marriage
vow had made them man and wife. No such cer-
emony took place; we aver it, as coming from the
lips of the doomed man.

<d>[Col.6]</d>
   The execution of Colt, it is understood, will take
place between three and four o'clock this afternoon.
it is not possible, therefore, to obtain the particu-
lars for this day's paper.

   A<small>FFGHANISTAN</small>.—We believe that Affghanistan
has been but partially known to the English them-
selves, till within the last eight or ten years.—
Though the seat of many great events in ancient
periods of history, it is now said to be inhabited by
a wild and uncivilized race. The mountain passes
are filled with robbers, and the mass of the popula-
tion are fierce and treacherous. The country that
bears the general name of Affghanistan, is quite
extensive, occupying <u>the greater</u> part of the space

			<b>John C. Colt.</b>
   The closing scene in the carrer of this wretched
man occurred yesterday. All the desperate ef-
forts of his counsel and friends to obtain a new
trial, a reprieve, or a mitigation of his sentence,
having utterly failed, and his last hope of avoid-
ing an immediate and shameful death being at an
end, he was married yesterday at noon to his mis-
tress, the mother of his child. At 3 o'clock P. M.
his brother and his wife took leave of him for ever,
and at his earnest solicitation, he was allowed to
pass his last hour alone. At a quarter before 4,
when the Sheriff went to his cell to prepare him
for execution, he was found dead! having driven
a knife to his heart!
   The life and death of this hapless being must
afford a solemn warning to the Youth of our City
and Land. Few of them are entering upon life
with fairer prospects, with nobler opportunities,
than were those of John C. Colt. Of a respected
and influential family, possessing good talents and
a winning address, enjoying and profiting by lib-
eral opportunities for mental culture, he might
fairly have looked forward to a life of usefulness,
honor and happiness, closing at ripe maturity in a
death-bed soothed by the attentions of loving and
sorrowing hearts. This <i>might</i> have been, but for
the canker in the heart—the selfishness, and pride,
and recklessness, which entered deeply into his
character—a disposition to measure every thing
by the standard of personal interest or gratifica-
tion. On this rock has he been wrecked; and
now, after a career neither exemplary nor happy,
we see him, at the early age of thirty, following in
ignominy and blood to the grave one victim of his
fierce, ungoverned passions, and leaving behind
him another, far more to be pitied, to a desolate
widowhood of anguish and shame. His orphan
child, too—an infant of few months—to what a
heritage of undeserved dishonor does it succeed!
while a most respected and worthy circle of rela-
tives are plunged in distress and doomed to endure
the hauntings of a painful, humbling remembrance!
And all this ruin is the work of one perverse spirit
—of one who might have been a blessing and an
honor to them all!
   Human justice has been robbed of its appropri-
ate sacrifice, yet to the Divine requirement the sat-
isfaction is complete. The blood of the victim no
longer cries from the ground for retribution. Let
the grave, then, cover his errors, save as they may
be rendered beacons to the pathway of Life.
   We will hope that this tragedy, viewed in all
its proportions, has done much to hasten the Abo-
lition of the Punishment of Death. We have re-
fused to take any part in the efforts made to obtain
a mitigation of Colt's punishment, for we felt that
if there ever was a case in which the public safety
required a bloody expiation of crime, this was such
a one. We do not believe that Colt premeditated
the death of Adams; we believe he was killed in
a <u title="frenzy">phrenzy</u> of passion, with no intent of robbery or
concealment. But we believe Colt was endeavor-
ing to send away the books, which Adams had
printed for him, clandestinely, and in violation of
his engagement that they should remain under the
control of Adams until paid for. But Colt was
proud and necessitous, and he thought only of rai-
sing money for his imminent wants. Adams
went to his room to reproach him with his bad
faith, when Colt repelled his imputations and struck
him, and then Adams clenching him to avoid fur-
ther beating, Colt seized the hatchet which lay at
hand and dealt blow after blow on his victim's
skull, any one of which must have occa-
sioned death. The circumstances render the case
one of murder, and the subsequent conduct of
Colt—his night of horrid effort—his packing and
shipping off the corpse—his taking away the watch
of Adams to his lodgings—his rigid concealment
of the whole tragedy, even from his brother and
his mistress—his reckless bearing on the trial, on
receiving his sentence, and generally since his ar-
rest—all stamp the deed with the character of a
felonious taking of life, and bespeak a mind callous
to the consequences of such a crime. If this case
were to be treated as one of something else than
murder, we do not see how a murder could ever
after be proved except in the bare case of human wit-
nesses observing its perpetration. “We quarrelled,
and I killed him,” would be the murderer's uniform
plea; and how should we resist it? It seems a just
rule to consider the act of killing a human being
a murder where the homicide himself, in his at-
tempts to avoid detection, clearly puts that con-
struction upon it.
   But what has been the influence of the Punish-
ment of Death in this case? What moral effects
have been produced by its existence? Have we
not seen the community divided—not equally, in-
deed, but still divided—with regard to the justice
of the sentence? And will not all admit that on
those who believe a punishment unjust its inflic-
tion on a criminal will exert an influence most per-
nicious—an influence adverse to reverence for and
attachment to the laws? Will not reflecting men
feel that the excitement and the concussion of the
last five days, as to whether Colt would or would
not, should or should not, be hung, has been pre-
judicial to that filial regard for the laws and their
administration which all ought to feel? If the
punishment of murder had been solitary confine-
ment for life, without chance of pardon, would not
the acquiescence of the community have been hearty
and universal, and the moral influence far more
salutary than now? And here at last we see the
gallows cheated of its prey, and the culprit hur-
ried out of existence by his own deadly hand, in a
manner which may well throw doubt on the sin-
cerity of his professions of penitence, or at least
on the healthy character of that compunction
<d>[Col.2. Partly as in <a href="#Herald-1842-11-18-extra-Col4">Herald</a>]</d>
which he undoubtedly felt, in view of a life so spent
and so closing.
   We have said nothing, done nothing, in behalf
of John C. Colt, or with a desire to mitigate his
sentence. In view of the ideas of crime and pun-
ishment which generally prevail, and on which
law is based, we have considered a speedy death
of penitence and example more merciful to him
than a life of solitary imprisonment. Not from
compassion to criminals but from regard to the com-
munity—whose sympathies and whose feelings are
so unhealthily excited by public executions—
whose abhorrence of Crime and reverence for Law
are confused and disturbed by these deeds of legal
butchery—we demand the abolition of the Punish-
ment of Death.

			<b>The Last Scene.</b>
   Yesterday C<small>OLT</small>, the convicted murderer of Sam-
uel Adams, was sentenced to be hung; but he
chose to take upon himself the office of execution-
er and rushed into eternity by staining his soul
with a crime as black as that which brought up-
on him the fate he so desperately sought to shun.
   Preparations for his execution were made at an
early hour in the morning. A messenger had gone
to Albany with an application to the Chancellor to
review his decision and allow a writ of error; by
the morning boat he returned with the following
decisive letter addressed to the Sheriff:
<m9>					A<small>LBANY</small>, Nov. 17, 1842.
   D<small>EAR</small> S<small>IR</small>: I heard the questions upon the writ of error in
Colt's case argued at great length at New-York, and came
to the deliberate determination that there was none of them
on which there was any room to doubt, as you will see from
my written opinion, which I left in the hands of Colt's coun-
sel when I left New-York, and which is now published in
the Argus of this morning. You will therefore see that it is
out of my power to violate my oath of office by allowing a
writ of error in the case, even if the application was now
regularly before me on an application upon notice to the
Attorney General. Neither would the allowance of the
writ stay the execution of the sentence, as I could not certify
that there was a probable cause for staying the proceed-
ings, and the Governor would not interfere without such
certificate.
   I have never heard any lawyer, except the counsel for
the prisoner, express any doubt as to the legality of the
conviction before the Court which tried him. Nor have I
been able to find any member of the Court of Errors who
would have voted to reverse the judgement on the ground
of the organization of the Court. It is perfectly natural
that the friends of this unhappy man should endeavor, if
possible, to stay his execution; but their anxiety to preserve
his life cannot excuse the officers of justice in making the
laws bend to their wishes; although the course which has
been pursued in this case has placed not only those officers
but the Governor in the most painful and trying situations.
The prisoner's counsel had the right to apply to the Chan-
cellor, the three Justices of the Supreme Court, or to any of
the eight Circuit Judges, for the allowance of a writ of er-
ror; and if any one of those twelve officers had any doubts
as to the legality of the conviction, he would of course
have allowed the writ. They have tried four or five, and
have failed; and if they were not satisfied with that, they
should have applied to others; but <u title="cannot (elsewhere)">not</u> ask those who
have fully examined the subject, and have no doubt, to vio-
late their duty by acting against their consciences.
				Yours, with respect,

   Colt was engaged nearly all night in writing a
reply to the letter of Governor S<small>EWARD</small>, which it
is said he ordered to be left sealed until his child
should be old enough to understand it. He was
under the care of Deputy Sheriffs Vultee and
Green, and in the morning was shaved and dressed,
and received a brief visit from his brother. The
gallows was erected in the centre of the area. It
was the same one used at the execution of Robin-
son in New-Jersey, and bore upon it marks of
twelve strokes of that hatchet, which never falls
but it sends to eternity a human soul. It consisted
simply of two upright posts, and one transversely
placed, with a rope over a <u title="pulley">pully</u>—one end being
attached to a heavy weight, and the other being
formed into a noose. At 11 o'clock Dr. Anthon,
in company with Samuel Colt, visited his cell, and
made preparations for his marriage with Miss
Henshaw, which was soon after performed in
presence of Samuel Colt, David Graham, Robert
Emmett, Justice Merritt, the Sheriff, and J. H.
Payne. After their marriage they were left alone
for nearly an hour. At about half past 12 Dudley
Selden went into his cell, and at 1 Colt took a
cup of coffee with his wife.
   His brother Samuel soon arrived and en-
tered his cell. He was still engaged in earnest
conversation with his wife, who was sitting on the
foot of the bed, <u title="convulsed with his tears (in Herald)">convulsed and in tears</u>. At
Colt's request, John Howard Payne and Lewis
Gaylord Clarke then went into his cell to take their
leave of him. Colt appeared exceedingly pleased
to see them; shook them cordially by the hand,
and conversed with apparent cheerfulness with
them for five minutes, when they bade him farewell,
both of them in tears. Colt's brother Samuel, and
his wife, remained in the cell about ten minutes
longer, when both left. His brother was deeply
affected, and looked more ghastly even than Colt
himself. His wife could scarcely support herself,
so violent were her feelings. She stood at the door
of the cell for a minute—Colt kissed her passion-
ately—strained her to his bosom, and watched her
receding form as she passed into the corridor.—
Here she stood and sobbed convulsively as though
her heart would break, for five minutes. At last
she was led away by Colt's brother, and his friends
followed.
   He then desired to see the Sheriff, who went into
his cell. Colt then told him emphatically that he
was innocent of the murder of Adams, and that he
never intended to kill him; he also told him that
he still had hopes that something would intervene
to save him from being hung, and begged him not
to execute the sentence of the law upon him.
The Sheriff told him to banish all hopes of that
kind, for he must die at four o'clock. He then re-
quested to see the Sheriff's watch, and set his own
by it to a minute. He then asked to see Dr. An-
thon, and the latter went into his cell, and remained
in prayer with him for about ten minutes. At the
close of this, Colt again sent for the Sheriff, and
said to him, “If there are any gentlemen present
who wish to see me, and take their leave of me, I
shall be happy to see them.”
   This was announced by the Sheriff, and all pre-
sent with one or two exceptions passed up to his
cell door, shook him by the hand, and took their
leave of him. To one gentleman connected with
the press, he said, “I've spoken harshly of some of
the press, but I do not blame you at all; it was all
my own fault; there were things that ought to have
been explained; I know you have a good heart;
and I forgive you from my soul freely! may God
bless you and may you prosper.”
   He then requested his keeper, Mr. <u>Greene</u>, to
let him be left alone until the last moment. This
was about 2 P. M. His cell was closed and he
was left alone till 20 minutes to 3, when some
friends of the Sheriff apprehending that he might
attempt to commit suicide, one of the Deputy Sher-
iffs, Hillyer, went to his cell door. Colt was then
walking up and down his cell, but turned round on
the door opening, smiled on Hillyer, shook him by
the hand, and kissed him, as he did several of those
who had just previously bid him farewell. He said
to Hillyer—“God bless you, and may you prosper
in this life, which is soon to close on me.”
   At a few minutes before 4, Sheriffs Hart and
Westervelt went to his cell to announce to him
that his hour had come—but their summons was
not needed. Dr. Anthon stepped into the door,
but started back in horror. On looking in at the
cell, the body of Colt lay stretched at full length
upon his bed, his hands crossed upon his abdomen
and covered with blood, and a small Spanish dirk
<d>[Col.3]</d>
driven to his heart, was sticking in his body. His
mouth and eyes were slightly open, and the knife
had not been moved after its deadly thrust. He
was pronounced dead by physicians in attendance,
the Coroner took charge of the body, and the cell
was locked.
   At this moment a volume of smoke and flame
burst from the large cupola on the prison; a tre-
mendous rush was made by those outside towards
the door and by those within to make their escape.
The great bell on the City Hall struck the alarm
at the precise hour fixed for the Execution; the
engines were promptly on the ground, but as the
fire was in the very summit of the cupola, the wa-
ter could not be made to reach it, and it continued
to burn downwards for an hour until the whole was
consumed to the roof. The greatest excitement
prevailed without. The multitude refused to be-
lieve in the story of his death, and a very general
impression prevailed that the whole was a <i>ruse</i> to
secure his escape.
   There prevailed a very general suspicion that
the cupola was set on fire; but there is no good
ground to believe it. A fire is constantly kept
there for the accommodation of the person em-
ployed to keep a look-out for fires. He had made
a very large fire yesterday, and went to see the
execution. The pipe, without doubt, became red
hot, and thus set the cupola on fire.
   The following report of the Inquest held by the
Coroner's Jury over the body, contains many par-
ticulars of interest concerning the last scene:
<m9 id="Tribune-1842-11-19-2-Colt-Inquest">	<b>Inquest on the Body of John C. Colt.</b>
   This wretched man having been found dead in his cot in
his cell in the City Prison, five minutes before the period
allotted for his execution, with a knife sticking in his left
breast, and his body and hands covered with blood, Dr. Ar-
cher, the Coroner, at 7 o'clock, summoned a jury of 22 men,
which convened in the Court of Sessions Chamber, into
which hundreds of spectators, anxious to see the self-immo-
lated man, and to hear the testimony, the explanation of the
cause and manner of his tragic death, were admitted, in or-
der to gratify, as far as possible, the intense solicitude that
existed on the subject, as also to allay the unreasonable out
of door excitement consequent upon the rumor that had been
bruited abroad that Colt was not dead, but had been suffered
to effect his escape.
   Among the number of those assembled were the Mayor,
Register, Sheriff, many of the Aldermen, Justices, and oth-
er public functionaries of the city, besides several members
of the bar and numerous representatives of the press.
   The following Jurors were sworn as the inquest, viz:—
<u title="Allan M. (elsewhere)">Allen N.</u> Sniffen, Joseph Keeler, William H. Prall, Fenelon
Hasbrouck, David D. Bradford, Henry McShee, Robert
Sands, Thomas Betts, Dr. John Sickels, George Pirnie, D.
D. <u title="Addison (elsewhere)">Adison</u>, Dr. J. W. <u title="Duvall (elsewhere)">Duval</u>, George Fisby, <u title="Lester Wilson (elsewhere)">Lester, Jr.</u>
Gen. John Burrows, John <u title="Ryker (elsewhere)">Riker</u>, Jr., John <u title="Horspool (elsewhere)">Horsepool</u>, Jr.
David Vandervoort, Samuel Greenman, Thomas <u title="Dunlap (elsewhere)">Donnelly</u>,
Farrand S. <u title="Stranahan (elsewhere)">Stranchan</u> and Samuel Nichols, Jr. After be-
ing sworn, the Jurors proceeded to the cell of the prison,
where the body was, to view the same, after which they
returned to the Sessions Chamber and the following wit-
nesses were examined.
   <i>Monmouth B. Hart</i>, Sheriff, sworn—I had a warrant for
the execution of John C. Colt, who was to have been exe-
cuted to-day—I have seen him several times to-day—the ex-
ecution was to take place at four o'clock, or at sunset at
his request—I had seen him about one hour prior to the time
fixed for his execution in his cell—I did not go in—He was
then alone—I know what persons have been in his cell, viz:
his attorneys, David Graham, Dudley Selden, Samuel Colt,
Robert Emmett, Caroline Henshaw, Mr. Vultee, Deputy
Sheriff, and Dr. Anthon, and a number of other gentlemen
whom I did not know who came in at his request, a number
of physicians and the officers of the prison. I went to his
cell door about 5 minutes before 4 to admit the Rev. Dr.
Anthon—had the cell door opened, Mr. Anthon attempted
to go in and stepped back when he saw the body on the cot.
   Then I passed him, went in myself, and saw Mr. Colt ly-
ing on the cot, with a knife sticking in the left side. I at-
temped to put my hand on his face, but having gloves on,
did not; saw blood on him and thought he was dead. The
execution did not take place. The Coroner then took
charge of the body and relieved me. I had him in charge
since the sentence. I had not examined the cell, but was in-
formed by Col. Jones, that he had. Never saw any knife
there, except a penknife. The knife found on him had a
four inch blade. I have no knowledge of any person car-
rying any knife to him. He wished his penknife to mend
his pen. When I saw him, about an hour before death, he
was on his feet, apparently making a prayer. All things
then appeared to be right.
   <i>John J. V. Westervelt</i>, Deputy Sheriff, sworn.—I visited
the prison very seldom during Colt's confinement. I was
not in his cell to-day, but I saw him at his cell door looking
out and shaking hands; saw him the last time at 2 or 2½
o'clock; have seen his body since he is dead, and recognized
it as the body of John C. Colt; the body was in the cell on
the bed, with a knife sticking in it. Have no knowledge of
any person conveying a knife into the cell to him.
   <i>Frederick L. Vultee</i>, Deputy Sheriff, sworn.—I have had
charge of John C. Colt, commencing with Tuesday morn-
ing, 3 o'clock, and watched him alternately every 6 hours.
I was released by <u title="Abraham H. Green (elsewhere)">David H. Green</u>, Deputy Sheriff. Have
seen Colt often since he was in my charge, two or three
times every watch. I have conversed with him. Never
saw any dangerous instrument in his cell, except the knife
and fork he ate with. (Dirk knife shown.) I never saw
such an instrument in his cell. First saw one like it sticking
in his body since death. I have no knowledge of the means
by which he procured that instrument. Saw him last alone
about 2 o'clock. The first person who visited him was
Samuel Colt, about 6½ o'clock this morning. At about 20
minutes to 8 o'clock William Dobson, barber, was sent for
to shave him.
   I was present in the cell while he was shaved. Samuel
Colt called again and brought with him Caroline Henshaw;
Dr. Anthon also called with them and went in. John How-
ard Payne was also with them, the High Sheriff and I think
also Robert Emmett and David Graham, Jr. I omitted to
state that his breakfast was brought in by a man from Mr.
Cowdrey's victualing cellar. The contents of the basket
were emptied and the young man left. I remained and
saw the contents of the basket. There was no knife, only
the knife and fork he ate with. Dudley Selden was in the
cell during my relief, when Mr. <u>Greene</u> had changed. Sam-
uel Colt was in the cell with the prisoner alone awhile this
morning. When the number of persons was there the mar-
riage ceremony of Colt with Caroline Henshaw took place.
During the whole time I had charge since Tuesday morn-
ing, no one was alone with the prisoner except Samuel Colt.
After they were married, Caroline his wife was in the cell
awhile with Colt. I have no knowledge how the knife
came into his possession.
   <i>Abner <u title="Milliken (elsewhere)">Milliker</u></i>, Deputy Coroner.—I have seen the body
of John C. Colt, and recognized it. The knife here was
taken from the body of John C. Colt by Drs. <u title="McComb">McCombe</u> and
Hosack.
   <i>Abraham H. Green</i>, Deputy Sheriff, sworn.—I commenced
watching Colt, and took the keys of the cell Monday after-
noon, 4 o'clock. I never saw the knife before I saw it in
the body of John C. Colt. I have no knowledge how that
instrument came in his cell. I cannot tell of any other per-
son visiting Colt's cell and being with him alone except
those named by preceding witnesses. I made no examina-
tion or search of Colt's Cell. This witness said he obeyed
the instructions of the Sheriff as to the manner of taking
care of prisoner.
   <i>Rev. Henry Anthon</i>, D. D. sworn—I as a clergyman at-
tended upon John C. Colt—my relations commenced on
Monday and I took notes of all my visits to the prisoner;
these, which he read, were very voluminous—they relate to
the conversations he had with Colt on religious subjects,
the belief of the latter, his apparent penitence, his assertion
that he prayed, his general converse regarding his future
state, the instruction the Rev. gentleman gave, the advice
he imparted to him, &c. &c.—the remark of Colt that the
Sheriff had taken his knife, &c. from him, which he said was
a needless persecution—<u>Colts</u> opposition to other ministers
seeing him to converse on doctrinal points—his avowal of
belief in the Christian creed, the divinity of Christ, his
power to save, &c.—altogether tending to induce the Rev.
gentleman to believe that Colt was a penitent man, having a
just sense of his sins and that he was deeply anxious about
his eternal welfare. He declared most solemnly that he
killed Adams in self-defence and said he would carry that
declaration to the bar of God—though man would not be-
lieve him. He complained much of the newspapers, of their
mis-stating and abusing him, &c.—gave a history of his ac-
quaintance with Caroline Henshaw, expressed his regard <u>for
for</u> her, and his wish to marry her.
   <i>He disavowed on Thursday all intention of taking his
own life, to Mr. Anthon</i>, and stated his determination to die
in the faith of the Gospel, and was melted to tears. To-
day Colt expressed great anxiety for Miss Henshaw and his
child, and gave Dr. Anthon $500 to put into the Savings
Bank for his wife and child, directing him to pay her $20 a
month from it while it lasted. He wished the child reli-
giously brought up and its mother to lead a virtuous life.
About 12 o'clock Mr. Anthon married Colt and Miss Hen-
shaw; Colt exhorted her most earnestly to lead a Godly
life and to take care of the child; at his request he was left
alone a short time with her. Mr. Anthon detailed his con-
versations with Colt concerning his death and burial, the
order for a coffin, Colt's request to have the coffin brought
in at 3 o'clock, his praying, &c. After 2 o'clock, Mr. Anthon
saw him and after conversation and prayer, Colt said he
thought he would be able to die with Christian fortitude.
About twenty minutes after this, Colt wished to be alone.</m9>
<d>[Col.4]</d>
<m9>awhile before his execution. I was to come again at near 4
o'clock; I did so, and on opening the cell door, found Colt
on his bed; at first thought him asleep, but saw something
on him, and the Sheriff cried out, “Oh God! he is dead!”
and I came away.
   The instructions of the Sheriff to his Deputies were read,
in which he ordered his irons to be taken off, but that he
should be strictly guarded, and all humanity, consonant with
his safety, extended to him.
   <i>Col. William Jones</i>, Keeper of the Prison, sworn.—Colt
was in my custody from the 2d July until Monday last, in
the afternoon, when I gave him up to the custody of the
Sheriff. I took a receipt from the Sheriff when I delivered
the prisoner to him. I have not seen the prisoner since
Monday; he continued in the same cell he was in before.
I searched his cell on Monday morning—the apertures, bed,
&c., and made a thorough search; no knife was there at
that time. I have no knowledge of how this knife got into
the cell; I never saw it before. I had his feet chained, but
not his hands.
   <i>Dr. John R. McComb</i>, sworn.—I am physician of the
City Prison—visited the prisoner almost every day until
Monday afternoon—have not seen him since then. I have
seen his dead body. A hole had been cut in his vest, a
piece taken out, and the knife sticking in his left side, about
half an inch below the left nipple, on the upper margin of
the fifth rib, between that and the fourth rib. A piece was
cut out of his vest and shirt, as with a knife, where the
knife was indented in the body. I have made a post mor-
tem examination of the body with Dr. Alexander Hosack.—
On raising the <u title="sternum">sternom</u> or breast-bone, and in the pericar-
dium, found much blood, and the knife 1½ inches in the left
ventricle of the heart, which caused death. It was driven
in as well as I could do it; it would not require much
force to insert the knife. On Monday he wanted me to lend
him a work on anatomy, which I refused telling him I
feared he wanted it for no good purpose. He then wished
me to point out the vein in the arm which could be most
easily reached, which I utterly refused to do, saying you
must not ask me such a thing.
   <i>Dr. Alexander Hosack</i>, sworn—Concurred with Dr. Mc-
Comb in the description of the wound and the cause of
death of John C. Colt.
   <i>Samuel Colt</i>, sworn.—I am the brother of the deceased.
I have no knowledge of the means by which the knife was
procured.
   <i>Mrs. Caroline Colt</i>, wife of John C. Colt, sworn.—I have
no knowledge how the deceased came into possession of the
knife found in him.
   Dr. Archer, the Coroner, charged the jury that if any evi-
dence had been furnished of any person having given the
knife to Colt, he could be indicted for manslaughter; but
as no such evidence was furnished, the jury would simply
find what was the cause and manner of the death of the de-
ceased.
   The jury then retired, and after a brief absence returned
with a verdict—that John C. Colt came to his death by a
wound inflicted by himself, with a knife, on the left breast
but the jury are unable to say in what manner he became
possessed of the said knife.
   After the inquest the body, which had been put in a coffin,
was placed in the dead-house, to be taken thence for inter-
ment by his friends this night in a vault in St. Mark's
Church.</m9>
   It seems clear, from this, that since Sunday last
when he felt that he had no hope of escape—not-
withstanding all his protestations of faith and re-
pentance, and his solemn disavowal of any intent
to commit suicide, this wretched man has steadily
cherished the purpose to escape the gallows by
killing himself. The dread tragedy has closed,
and his soul has met his victim at the bar of their
common God.

<m9>   ☞ As it was formally given out in the public prints that
one reporter from each newspaper, regularly employed
thereon, would be admitted by the Sheriff to witness the
execution of Colt, the Police and Criminal Courts reporter
for The Tribune presented himself, and on our behalf
claimed admittance. This was <i>refused</i> by Mr. Deputy
Sheriff Westervelt, on the ground that <i>The Tribune had
said harsh things of Sheriff Hart and his brother, Dr. Hart!</i>
We place on record the fact and the reason, leaving the pub-
lic to judge of its relevance and sufficiency. Since the
Sheriff and his factotum appear to imagine the admission of
proper persons on such occasions a personal perquisite of
theirs, to be dispensed according to their ideas of the favor
to which the applicant is entitled at their hands, we trust
they will have the manliness to give notice accordingly at
another time, and not mislead us by a false publication. Of
favors at their hands we ask and will have none.</m9>

   T<small>HE</small> E<small>VENTS OF</small> Y<small>ESTERDAY</small>.—Seldom indeed
has the city of New York been in such a ferment
of excitement, as it was during yesterday. In
all quarters of the city, and in all circles, the ap-
proaching execution of Colt was the all-absorbing
topic of conversation, and apparently of thought.
There was an evident gloom pervading our streets
and overshadowing the countenances of our citi-
zens. Some of the morning papers were crowd-
ed with fictitious rumors and reports of all sorts
in relation to the unfortunate culprit, and those
connected with him, which had an effect to more
universally excite public curiosity, and unsettle
the public mind from the even balance which it
generally holds; and one of the results was, that,
though it had become generally known that the
Sheriff, at the request of prisoner, had consented
to postpone the execution till 4 o'clock, P. M., as
early as 8 o'clock large crowds assembled about
the prison, remaining, and constantly accumula-
ting, till the arrival of the fatal hour. As the
execution was, however, to be as private as the
Sheriff could consistently make it, none of the
crowd were admitted within the prison precincts;
but thousands appeared to take an unaccountable
satisfaction in crowding around and gazing at the
high and impenetrable walls.
   From 8 o'clock in the morning, till 2 o'clock P.
M., the prisoner was visited by a large number of
persons, including his brother, the Rev. H. An-
thon, who has been his faithful and devoted spir-
itual adviser, his counsel, and numerous personal
friends; with all of whom, previous to the latter
hour, he had taken an affecting and eternal fare-
well.
   At 12 o'clock, agreeably to previous arrange-
ment, Caroline Henshaw, who had lived with him
as his wife a length of time prior to the fatal
event which tore them apart, was conducted to
his cell by two of his most devoted friends, and
in presence of several witnesses the marriage ce-
remony between them was performed by Mr. An-
thon. This marriage, the bridegroom being un-
der sentence of death, and already dead in the eye
of the law, has no legal validity, and can only
have the effect of redeeming in the eyes of some,
the character of this unfortunate woman.
   After the marriage Mr. Anthon was left alone
with them a few minutes, and he then left them
to themselves till 1 o'clock, when she took her
last sad farewell of him. After a brief visit from
Dr. Anthon for the purpose of prayer, at his re-
quest his cell was closed, and he not disturbed
for over half an hour; at which time, owing to a
suggestion that he might commit suicide, Mr.
Hillyer, deputy sheriff, opened his cell door and
found him pacing the floor. He took an affec-
tionate farewell of Hillyer, and was again left
alone, <i>never to be looked upon again a living man</i>.
   In the mean time some three hundred persons
had, by permission of the Sheriff, collected in and
about the passage between the prison and the
Elm street wall, in which the dread instrument of
death had been erected. The gallows was erect-
ed early in the morning, under the prisoner's
window.
   Twelve indentations made by the hatchet,
where the rope is cut, were counted by some of
the curious, which testify that the instrument has
done service in twelve executions. It is the <u title="gibbet">gibbit</u>
on which Robinson, of New Jersey, was hung.
A box containing the hatchet and two or three
nooses was standing near. Some looked with
horror, and some were making themselves merry
at the sight of these implements of death.
   A few minutes before 4 o'clock, Sheriff Hart and
Deputy Westervelt, attended by Dr. Anthon, pro-
ceeded to the cell for the purpose of bringing the
condemned out to execution; but upon the keeper
drawing the bolt and opening the door, they found
that, during the hour he had thus been left entire-
ly to himself, he had forestalled the hangman, and
<i>put an end to his life with his own hand</i>. He was
found lying on his back, stretched out at full
length on the bed, quite dead, but not cold. A
clasp knife, like a small dirk knife, with a broken
handle, was sticking in his heart. He had stab-
bed himself about the fifth rib on the left side.
His vest was open, the blood had flowed slightly,
and his hands, which were placed across his belly,
were bloody; he had evidently driven <u>the fatal
the fatal</u> knife directly into his heart. His
body was laid out quite straight in the
bed, as if laid out for a funeral by others.
His mouth was open, and his eyes partly open.
Dr. Hosack and others went into his cell and
pronounced him dead.
   The Coroner was ready at hand, took charge of
the body, and locked the cell; and after summon-
ing a jury last evening held an inquest on the re-
mains of the ill-fated suicide.
   The <i>finale</i> to this exciting and extraordinary
case was not unexpected to many, and but little
surprise was felt, either among those within the
prison walls, or the crowds in the streets, when it
was announced to them. Nevertheless, it tended
to add to the prevailing excitement; and as the
intelligence flew like wildfire throughout the city,
it seemed to appall all minds, and absorb all
thought.
   Still further fuel was added to the popular ex-
citement by the most singular fact, that at the
instant the death of Colt was proclaimed, the
large new cupola of the front building was dis-
covered to be on fire, at or very near its top. The
alarm produced by this event instantly swelled
the concourse of people assembled to double its
former numbers; and caused great confusion and
most intense excitement. The cupola being
above the reach of the hydrants, and the wind
being high, it was totally destroyed before the pro-
gress of the flames could be stayed; but beyond
some injury to the roof, no further damage was
done. The fire is <i>attributed</i> to a stove pipe in the
cupola; but the coincidences connected with it,
and with the peculiar time of its occurrence, gave
rise to surmises among the public that the confla-
gration was, to say the least, a very <i>strange</i> oc-
currence.
<l9>   I<small id="Sun-1842-11-19-Colt-Inquest">NQUEST ON THE BODY OF</small> J<small>OHN</small> C. C<small>OLT</small>.—

<d>[Col.2]</d>
<l9>rently making a prayer. All things then appear-
ed right.
	...
   The jury then retired, and after a brief absence
returned with a verdict that John C. Colt came to
his death by a wound inflicted by himself, with a
knife, <u title="on (elsewhere)">in</u> the left breast, but the jury are unable
to say in what manner he <u title="became (elsewhere)">came</u> possessed of the
said knife.
   The deceased was 32 years of age, a native of
Connecticut.
   After the inquest the body, which had been
placed in a coffin, was placed in the dead house,
to be taken thence for interment by his friends
in a vault in St. Mark's church.
   Thus ends this truly tragical affair—beginning
in murder and ending in suicide—a warning to oth-
ers, to beware how they indulge their evil and des-
tructive passions.</l9>

<d>[Col.3]</d>
   T<small>HE TERRORS OF THE LAW</small>.—Again the awful
doom of death has been carried into effect, though
in a manner not contemplated by our statutes, in
obedience to the stern demands of those laws
which compose the barrier and safeguard of socie-
ty. Without laws to control the violence of uncon-
trolled passion, it would be impossible for society
to exist, and men would become like savage beasts,
knowing no rule but force and stratagem. The
punishment of crime is one of the sacred duties of
the social compact. It is a solemn obligation
which the community at large owes to each indi-
vidual member, and on the faithful performance of
this duty each one relies for security in life, limb,
reputation and worldly possessions. Whatever
opinions may be entertained with regard to the ex-
pediency of capital punishments, or whatever
views may have prevailed in reference to the ex-
tenuating circumstances of this case, it must be
conceded by all that the wretched self-murderer
has had the benefit of a full, fair and impartial trial,
and an anxious and minute examination of his
case in the various tribunals before which it has
been brought, and has suffered the last terrible
extremity of punishment strictly in accordance
with the existing laws of his country. Surround-
ed by influential friends, and himself of more than
common intelligence, a degree of sympathy has
been excited in his behalf which is very un-
usual. Counsel able, eloquent and ingenious,
have labored untiringly to obtain his release—
means have been used to influence public opinion
in his favor, and a great change has actually been
wrought in public sentiment, in regard to the sub-
ject of capital punishment. Yet amid all, the
law takes its course with unwavering precision.
Pity may weep over the fate of the victim, thus
unseasonably cut off from life—that life, which
but for one act of ungoverned passion might long
have been spared to the improvement of his own
moral condition, and the reformation of those
false ideas which subsequently actuated him to
justify the bloody deed. Mercy may deprecate the
inexorable decree—but the better judgment of all
must rejoice to discover, amid the laxity of moral
order which has stained the annals of the country
for several years past, that law and justice have
not entirely fled the land.
   In the life and end of John C. Colt may be read
a terrible lesson upon the necessity of controlling
the temper. The habitual indulgence of pride,
anger, and those absurd notions of dignity arising
merely from self love, and falsely called a sense
of honor, had fostered in his breast a spirit of
haughtiness and severity which rendered him
impatient of contradictions and little regardful
of the sacred rights of others, when opposed to
the gratification of his own feelings. A few mo-
ments of forbearance and reflection would proba-
bly have saved him from the commission of the
awful crime, with all its disastrous train of con-
sequences, and the unhappy victim of his
wrath, instead of being “sent to his account,
with all his imperfections on his head,” might
still be living to repent of and amend his
faults, if such he had, and to discharge his duties,
as a husband, a father, and a member of the com-
munity. Here too we see how one crime brings
<s>????????????????</s> and how completely the
<s>???????????????????????????????????????</s>

   L<small>IVERIES</small>.—Mr. Dickens, the aristocratic
young Englishman, who takes special pains, in
his “invaluable” work on America, to sneer at
the poor Gothamites because he saw but <i>one</i>
hand-organ and monkey, and <i>one</i> carriage in live-
ry in our streets, would find, were he <i>now</i> to re-
turn amongst us, that we had somewhat improv-
ed in these respects during his brief absence, and
that our republican aristocracy, as if ashamed of
his having seen them in such humble plight, have
increased the number of their liveried establish-
ments, to what he would undoubtedly consider a
very creditable extent. It is now no rare thing
to see half a dozen splendid carriages standing
before the door of Stuart's, or some of the other
aristocratic establishments in Broadway, with a
groom and footman, “as big as lords,” strutting
or lounging before them, flaming in great gilt
buttons, jaunty hats, and white top boots. To be
sure, these exquisite gentlemen are none of them
<i>Americans</i>—our benighted people being as yet
too awkward and boorish for this sort of work;
but, by the time the next general bankrupt law
shall have become necessary, and Mr. Dickens
succeeds in establishing the international copy-
right, it is to be hoped that the sturdy young
Americans will have become more civilized!

   T<small>HE</small> C<small>HANCELLOR ON</small> C<small>OLT'S</small> C<small>ASE</small>.—We yes-
terday morning received, through the columns of
the Albany Argus, the Chancellor's opinion on
the application of John C. Colt for a writ of er-
ror. It is in the usual able manner of that distin-
guished jurist, but of such length that, though in-
teresting, its insertion in our crowded columns at
this late day, seems hardly called for.
   As will, of course, be known without a mention
of the fact here, the second application to the
Chancellor, of which we made <a class="l" href="#Sun-1842-11-18">mention</a> yester-
day, was as unsuccessful as the first; and we re-
fer to it here to correct an error into which we and
our cotemporaries were led in relation to the part
alleged to have been taken by B. F. Butler, Esq.,
in that application. He merely wrote to the
Chancellor on the subject, expressing the hope,
that unless prevented by an imperative sense of
judicial duty, the writ might be allowed.

<d id="Sun-1842-11-19-Col6">[Col.6]</d>
   ☞ There is a report current about town, said
to have originated in some confessions alleged to
have been made by the late Mrs. Loss, of Wee-
hawken, on her death bed last week, that Mary
Rogers came to her death under the hands of a
physician in an attempt to produce a premature
delivery—that her body was sunk in the river,
her clothes scattered through the woods, &c. At
present there is nothing known authentically
which gives to this report a greater degree of
credence than a dozen other contradictory re-
ports in relation to the girl are entitled to. Ac-
cording to this report, Mrs. Loss made one of her
sons accessory to the homicide, after the fact;
and it is said he has been arrested in New Jersey.
Within the past week a report has been quite cur-
rent that the girl is alive, and in the keeping of
her former employer; and another, that she was
a few days since seen in Albany by a gentleman
of this city who knew her well. We place little
reliance on any of these rumors.

<l9>   C<small>ORONER'S</small> O<small>FFICE</small>, Friday, Nov. 18.—E<small>X-
TRAORDINARY</small> S<small>UICIDE</small>.—The Coroner held an
inquest today at the City Hospital, on the body
of Robert Darris, a native of Ireland, who was a
carpenter by trade, had lived for the last 14
years with Mr. Morris, of Morrisiana, Westches-
ter county, and was still in his employ, but for the
last 3 or 4 days was observed to be somewhat
deranged. Yesterday morning his fellow work-
men found him in the carpenter's shop, with a
chisel in one hand and the edge of it to his throat,
while with the other hand, which he used as a
mallet, he drove the instrument to the bone of the
neck, which was partially chipped off by the
force that was used. The blood was so far stop-
ped as to permit his being conveyed to the City
Hospital between 2 and 3 o'clock in the afternoon,
where he died this morning about 8 o'clock, des-
pite the efforts of the physicians. Verdict, that
he committed suicide by cutting his throat with a
<u>chissel</u>, during a fit of insanity.</l9>

			JOHN C. COLT.
   <i>The place of Execution</i>.—At ten minutes before
four o'clock yesterday afternoon, some five hundred
persons were ranged in two rows from a gallows
erected at the extreme end of the Court yard in the
City Prison to the door at the opposite end commu-
nicating with the interior, and every spot around,
that commanded a view of the place of execution,
was filled with the spectators. In front of the row,
Police Officers were stationed with staffs to keep the
line unbroken. All eyes were turned to the place at
which the criminal was expected to enter, in painful
anxiety, when suddenly a Deputy Sheriff appeared
announcing “that he had killed himself”—and won-
derful to say, in the midst of the confusion that en-
sued, it was discovered that the cupola, seventy
feet high, was on fire. Fanned by the high wind,
the whole wooden fabric was soon enveloped in
flames and burned intensely for an hour,—a strange
funeral pyre, that told, though the extreme sentence
of the law had been evaded, its majesty had been vin-
dicated by the death of the murderer.
   The engines arrived speedily on the spot and pre-
vented the fire extending to the main building. It
was caused by a stove in the cupola, which had been
filled by the persons usually stationed there, with
coal, previous to leaving it to see the execution, and
becoming very much heated had set fire to the wood
near it.
   We had flattered ourselves that when the grave
had closed over this unhappy man, we should have
been free to express our opinions on many circum-
stances connected with his case, but the excitement
from early dawn till late at night, among an immense
mob, has been so great, that the peace of the city,
we think, demands silence of us, at the present mo-
ment.
   The particulars elicited by the Coroner's Inquest,
which we give below, render it unnecessary for us to
seek further to expose the scenes which passed
throughout the morning in the convict's cell. His
marriage with his mistress, Caroline Henshaw, at
about 12 o'clock we believe, however, is not adverted
to in it. The motives which led to such an extraor-
dinary proceeding, are to us inscrutable. Neither re-
ligion nor morality, nor affection, one would think,
could have prompted it.
   The clearness of the sky in the afternoon, when
the strong west wind had blown away the thick
clouds which have covered us for some days, was
very remarkable and beautiful. The planet Venus
was <i>distinctly visible</i> in the West in the broad glare of
day, notwithstanding the brilliancy of the sun's
rays. The many singular events and coincidences
of that wonderful day will make the 18th of Novem-
ber a day long remembered in the New York city.

<l9>   <i id="Courier-1842-11-19-Colt-Inquest">Inquest by the Coroner on the body of John C. Colt</i>—
At 7 o'clock last evening, the Coroner, Dr. A. B. Ar-
cher, held an inquest on the body of the deceased
criminal, in the Sessions Court Room. The large
room with the surrounding gallery, was crowded in
every part to excess.
   The following named gentlemen, were empanelled
as a jury of inquest:
   Allan M. Sniffen, <i>Foreman</i>, Joseph Keeler, Wm.
H. Prall, Fenelon Hasbrouck, David D. Bradford,
Henry McShee, Robert A. Sands, Thomas Betts,
John Sickels, George Pirnie, D. D. Addison, J. W.
Duvall, George Fisby, Lester Wilson, Jno. Burrows,
Jno. Ryker, Jr., Jno. Horspool, Jr., David Vander-
voort, James B. Greenman, Thomas Dunlap, Samuel
Nichols, Jr., and Farrand S. Stranahan.
   The Jury having viewed the body, and on returning
several of them answered that they recognized it as
that of John C. Colt. Whereupon Monmouth B.
Hart, Sheriff, was called to the stand. On being
sworn, he stated that he was Sheriff of the County.
Received a warrant for the execution of the prisoner.
He was to have been executed this day.
   I have seen the prisoner a number of times to-day;
the time of the execution was fixed at 4 o'clock, or
at the going down of the sun. I saw him about one
hour previous to calling him for execution. I stood
on the outside of the cell and saw him inside; he was
alone in the cell.
   Coroner—Do you know what persons have been
in his cell to-day?
   His <u title="Attorneys">Attornies</u>, Alderman Graham, Mr. Selden,
Samuel Colt, Robert <u>Emmett</u>, Caroline Henshaw, as
I suppose, I never saw her before. I think I saw
Mr. Vultee, a deputy sheriff, in there, and a number
of gentlemen whose names I can't recollect, went in at
his request, or were requested to do so; among them
were several physicians; Rev. Dr. Anthon also went
in; the officers of the prison also, whose names, all
of them, I <u>dont</u> know.
   I went to his cell five minutes before four o'clock;
I did not go there to lead him out to execution; I
went to admit Rev. Mr. Anthon; the cell door was
opened; Mr. Anthon attempted to go into the cell,
and retired immediately on seeing the body lying on
the cot; I then passed Mr. A. and went in myself;
I saw Colt lying on the cot with a knife sticking
in his left side; I put my hand on his face; I had
my glove on, but thought he was dead; I then
came out, and ordered the door closed; I thought it
would prevent excitement; I heard the physicians
say he was dead; the execution did not take place;
has not seen the body since this time.
   I have made no examination of the cell since his
sentence, to look for dangerous weapons; but learn-
ed that Col. Jones had done so. When last I saw
him he had a pen knife; the knife I saw in his body;
I think the handle was about four inches in length,
and the blade probably the same. He said he could
not use steel pens, and therefore he was allowed a
penknife. When last I saw him, he was standing
with his face to the wall; I thought in prayer; I dis-
turbed him and said as an excuse, Mr. Hillyer, depu-
ty sheriff, wishes to see you; he was all right and
well then.
   <i>John J. <u title="V.">C.</u> Westervelt sworn</i>, am under Sheriff.—
I was not in Colt's cell to-day; I saw him shaking
hands with several persons at the cell door; I last
saw him at about half-past 2 o'clock; have seen the
body since his death; the body was in the cell when
I saw it; It was in every respect as described by the
Sheriff; I have no knowledge of any person's con-
veying the knife to him.
   <i>Frederick L. Vultee</i>, Deputy Sheriff, sworn. Have
since the sentence of Colt had charge of him. I
commenced watch last Tuesday morning, 3 o'clock,
and resumed the watch every alternate 6 hours, and
was relieved by Abm. <u title="H.">S.</u> Green, deputy sheriff. Have
seen Colt two or three times every watch since he
has been in my charge, and have conversed with
him. I never saw him have any dangerous weapon
but the knife and fork with which he ate. I never
saw (fatal knife shewn) this knife in his cell. Saw
one like it sticking in his body after his death.—
Have no knowledge of the means by which he pro-
cured the knife. Saw him last, alive, about 2 o'clock.
Can tell who visited him from 2 till 9 o'clock this
morning; the first person was Samuel Colt, at about
half past 6 o'clock this morning; at about 20 min-
utes to 8 o'clock, Wm. <u title="Dolsen, Dolsens (elsewhere)">Dolson</u>, Barber, of Centre st.
was sent for to shave him; I was present inside the
cell during the shaving. Samuel Colt called subse-
quently with Miss Henshaw. Dr. Anthon and Dr.
Francis also called. Colt and Miss H. called during
a relief to Mr. Green, who went to get his (Colt's)
dinner. John Howard Payne was also in the cell
with the parties named at this time; the High Sher-
iff was also there, and also Messrs. Graham and
<u>Emmett</u>; I think I have omitted to state that his
breakfast was brought in by a young man from Mr.
Cowdrey's Victualling Cellar in Center st.; the bask-
et was emptied and the young man left in my pres-
ence.
   Mayor Morris—Any thing farther of persons do
you remember?
   Dudley <u>Seldon</u>, I believe. The barber could have
left nothing without my knowledge. When the
large number of persons were present the marriage
ceremony between Colt and Miss Henshaw, took
place. I have neither remote or distinct, knowledge
as to how <i>the</i> knife came in his cell. Miss Henshaw
was left alone in Colt's cell a little while after the
marriage.
   <i>Abner Milliken</i>, Coroner's Clerk, called. Have
seen the body of John C. Colt, and recognized it.
The knife now shewn was taken from the body by
Drs. McComb and <u title="Hosack">Hossack</u>. I have had no know-
ledge of Colt's custody or keeping, being attached to
the Coroner's office.
   <i>Abraham H. Green</i>, Deputy Sheriff, sworn—Have
had Colt in custody at alternate watches, since Mon-
day last about 3 o'clock. Saw the knife here shewn,
or one similar, in Colt's body, but never saw it be-
fore. I know of no person but those mentioned by
previous witnesses having visited Colt's cell. Have
never searched his cell for dangerous weapons
otherwise than to look carefully around, nor has any
one else to my knowledge. (Witness here produced
a written letter of instructions for guarding the pri-
soner, from the Sheriff.)
   <i>J. C. Hart</i>, stated that he wished the witness exa-
mined to show the reasons why the custody of the
prisoner was transferred from the keeper to the She-
riff.—Mayor objected.
   <i>Rev. Henry M. Anthon</i>, sworn. I am the clergy-
man who attended deceased. I commenced visiting
him on Monday. I have made notes at my various
visits—the notes extend from Monday till Thursday.
Here the Rev. gentleman read a long account of the
various interviews with the prisoner, which was lis-
tened to throughout, with much interest by the
crowded auditory.
   The witness proceeded—The foregoing notes re-
late to my visits up to Thursday. On Friday mor-
ning he expressed a wish to marry Miss Henshaw.
He gave me $500, which he had received from his
brother, which he wished me to <u title="deposit">deposite</u> in some sa-
vings bank, and allow Miss H. after she was mar-
ried, and for the child's benefit—she to receive $20
per month. I wanted him to give me the child, to
which he objected. I agreed to stand as sponsor for
the child, and give it a religious education, as far as
I could, to which he assented. About 12 o'clock
married them, and retired, leaving them together—
about 1 o'clock, had an interview with Saml. Colt
respecting the interment. He seemed much affected
and said he had made none, and “didn't think it
would come to that.” I gave orders for the inter-
ment myself. At 20 minutes to 2 o'clock, prayed
with him and left him, wishing him to bear up with
Christian fortitude to the end.
   At 20 minutes after 3 o'clock, the Sheriff called
on me, where I was in a neighboring cell, and stated
that some arrangements were necessary previous to
four o'clock; I recommended not to disturb him till
the latest moment, to which he acceded; at 4 o'clock
the Sheriff called me; we went to the cell; I was
going in, and saw something I thought unusual; the
Sheriff saw my perplexity, and exclaimed Oh! my
God he has killed himself; I was taken to one of the
other cells and know nothing more of the matter.
   [The letter of instructions here read.]
   <i>Col. Wm. Jones</i>, keeper City Prison sworn.—Have
had Colt in my custody from the second of July last
till last Monday, when the Sheriff took charge of
him; have not seen prisoner since Monday last; he
was continued in the same cell; while in the Sher-
iff's custody the opinion of the Governor was com-
municated to him on Monday morning; I then
searched his cell thoroughly and found no dangerous
weapon; his person was not searched; never saw
the knife now shewn before, nor have I any know-
ledge of the means by which it got into his posses-
sion; I had him chained, his feet manacled, last
Monday.
   Dr. Jno. R. M'Comb, Physician to the City Prison,
sworn.—Previous to last Monday have visited Colt
every day, and saw him on Monday afternoon; have
seen the body since his death; the knife now shewn
was found in his body. A hole two inches square
was cut through the vest and shirt, and through this
hole and into the body about half an inch from the left
nipple, between the fourth and fifth rib, the knife was
lodged—the hole in the clothes appeared as though
done with a knife rather than scissors. I have made,
with D. <u>Hossack</u>, a post mortem examination of the
body. Upon raising the sternum the knife still ad-</l9>

<l9>hered, and beneath the pericardium, found a great
quantity of suffused and coagulated blood. It was
the wound from the knife, which was an inch and a
half deep, was the cause of death. The heart was
pierced with the blade. On Monday he desired of
me the loan of a work on anatomy; I refused the
loan. He then put out his arm and wished me to
point out the arteries the easiest of access; I refused
to reply—thinking he meant no good—and said “you
must not ask such questions. He was much distress-
ed a the time.
   Dr. <u>Hossack</u>, sworn—Corroborated the statements
of Dr. McComb.
   Samuel Colt, brother of the deceased, sworn—I
have no knowledge of how the knife was conveyed to
the cell.
   Caroline M. H. Colt, wife of deceased, sworn—I
have no knowledge as to how John C. Colt got pos-
session of the knife. The testimony here closed, and
the Coroner stated that the object of prolonging the
enquiry was to discover whether any person had
conveyed to the deceased the fatal knife. Had such
been proved, the person who committed the act
would be liable to indictment for manslaughter. As
no proof however on that point had been adduced,
they had only to find on the manner of the death of
the deceased.
   The Jury rendered a verdict that, “John C. Colt
came to his death by a wound inflicted by himself
with a dirk knife in his left breast—how the knife
came into his possession, is to the Jurors unknown.”</l9>

incorrect, as no such examination took place, nor
could it, from the deranged state of Mrs. Loss' mind.

<b>The Last Day of John C. Colt—His Extra-
	ordinary Suicide and Death.</b>
   In another part of this day's paper, will be found
the extraordinary suicide and death of John C. Colt,
before the hour appointed by law for his execution,
and the no less extraordinary circumstances of his
marriage to Caroline <u title="Henshaw">Renshaw</u>, his final separation,
and the firing of the cupola of the Halls of Justice
about the hour at which he committed the fatal act
that closed his course on earth.
   We hardly know where to begin, or how to ex-
press the feelings and thoughts which rise up in the
mind in contemplating this awful—this unexampled
—this stupendous—this most extraordinary and most
horrible tragedy. The death of Adams and the cir-
cumstances attending the fatal deed, can only be
paralleled by the trial, sentence and awful suicide of
Colt. The history of this case cannot be equalled
in its horrors by that of any criminal trial on re-
cord.
   Yet it will not probably end here. The public
will demand a full investigation of the circumstan-
ces through which such a catastrophe was permit-
ted. How came Colt to ask for religious con-
solation from a clergyman, and yet to commit
suicide? The prayers said over him by
the Rev. Mr. Anthon, seem to have had little influ-
ence on his mind, when we look at the horrible ter-
mination of his life. Christianity had not penetra-
ted or pervaded the last moments of his existence
in the remotest degree. Taking all the horrid cir-
cumstances of his end into consideration, we have
every reason to believe that Governor Seward will
order an investigation into the facts—and ascertain
that no one is to blame for such a death but the un-
fortunate being himself. Toward him that was,
none can have any feeling but that of pity, commis-
seration, and deep anguish of heart. From the first
moment of his trial to the last pulsation of his ex-
istence, he seems to have been under the influence
of a false system of morals—a perverted sense of
human honor—and a sentiment that is at utter vari-
ance with the mysterious revelations of Christianity
or the sacred institutions of justice in civilized
society. The perverted principles of honor and re-
spectability, that spring from modern philoso-
phy and human pride, have precipitated him
upon the fatal precipice. These principles
arising from materialism in philosophy, and unbe-
lief in all revelation, are too rife in the world,
and may be looked upon as the principal cause of
all the licentiousness, private and public, which
seems to overwhelm the whole institutions of civi-
lized society in one mass of uproar, confusion and
despair.
   We cannot say more to-day—nor could we say
less at this most momentous crisis. We have no
doubt Governor Seward will order an investigation
at once into this most unheard of—most unparallel-
ed tragedy.

   S<small>TAR</small> G<small>AZING</small>.—Yesterday afternoon a bright star
was seen in the southeastern sky—the sun shining
bright at the time. The weather was clear, and dry
and cold. Hundreds of people were gazing from
the corner of every street. Some supposed it had
reference to Colt—others that it was only the ap-
proach of the 23d of April, 1843, as prophesied by
Father Miller. It was only the planet Venus.

   The preparations for the execution of John C. Colt
were all made at an early hour this morning.
   The messenger sent to Albany returned at an early
hour with the information that the Chancellor had
peremptorily refused to grant a Writ of Error on the
second application of the counsel of Colt. Senator
Verplanck has also replied to a letter of Colt's coun-

				E<small>IGHT O'CLOCK</small>, P. M.
   T<small>HE</small> C<small>ORONER'S</small> I<small>NQUEST</small>.—At the hour of seven
o'clock Coroner Archer, with a jury selected by his
deputy, Abner Milliken, Esq., assembled in the
Court Room of the General Sessions in order to in-
vestigate the cause of the death of John C. Colt.
The Court Room was crowded to excess as soon as
the doors were opened, and the galleries filled to
overflowing by the anxious spectators. The Coro-
ner was accompanied by His Honor Mayor Morris,
Aldermen Crolius, Stewart and Smith. Order be-
ing restored, the following gentlemen were sworn
as jurors:—Allan M. Sniffen, Joseph Keeler, Wm.
H. Prall, Fenelon Hasbrouck, David D. Bradford,
Henry McShee, Robert A. Sands, Thomas Betts,
Dr. John Sickels, George Pirnie, D. D. Addison,
Dr. J. W. Duvall, George Fisby, Lester Wilson,
John Burrows, John Ryker, Jr., John Horspool, Jr.,
David Vandervoort, James B. Greenman, Thomas
Dunlap, F. S. Stranahan, Samuel Nichols, Jr.
   The jury having been qualified they proceeded to
the City Prison in order to examine the body of
Colt, and on their return—
<l9>   M<small>ONMOUTH</small> B. H<small>ART</small>, sheriff of the county of New
York, was called and sworn and deposed as follows:
—I have a warrant for the execution of John C.
Colt, who was to have been executed this day—I saw
the deceased to-day several times—his execution
was to have taken place at 4 o'clock, on the going
down of the sun, according to his request—I had
seen him one hour before the time that I found him;
he was alone in the cell at that time—David Gra-
ham, Dudley Selden, Samuel Colt, Robert Emmett,
Caroline Henshaw, Deputy Sheriff Vultee, and a
number of other gentlemen whose names I cannot
recollect were in his cell during the day—a number
of physicians were also in his cell during the day.
The Rev. Dr. Anthon was in his cell several times,
as also the officers of the prison whose names I do
not know—I went to his cell to open the door at five
minutes before 4 o'clock in the afternoon to admit
Dr. Anthon—he attempted to go into the cell, and
upon seeing the body immediately stepped back—
I then passed him and went in myself and saw
Colt lying on the cot with a knife sticking in his left
side. I put my hands on his face, and supposing that
he was dead I retired, and ordered the doors to be
closed; it was afterwards ascertained that he was
dead, and the execution did not take place. I have
not seen the body since, as the Coroner took charge
of it and locked the cell door. I have not examined
the cell of Colt since he has been in my charge, that
is since the sentence. Col. Jones, the keeper of the
prison, has informed me that he examined the cell
thoroughly. I have no knowledge of any person
carrying a deadly weapon into his cell. He was
allowed to keep his penknife, because he said he
did not use steel pens, and I left the knife with him
that he might use it to make pens to write with; the
penknife is not the one that he killed himself with.
I saw him the last time when Mr. Hillyer parted
with him at about a quarter before 3 o'clock.
   J<small>OHN</small> J. V. W<small>ESTERVELT</small>, under sheriff, was called
and sworn.—I saw the deceased at half past two for
the last time; I have seen the body since and re-
cognize it as the body of John C. Colt; I have no
knowledge of any person having conveyed the
knife to him with which he committed suicide.
   F<small>REDERICK</small> L. V<small>ULTEE</small>, Deputy Sheriff called and
sworn. I have had charge of prisoner since Tues-
day morning last at 3 o'clock, and resumed my
watch every alternate six hours. I was relieved by
Abraham H. Green, deputy sheriff. I have seen
him frequently since he has been in my charge; two
or three times during my watch have conversed
with him. I have never seen any dangerous instru-
ment in his cell, except a knife and fork with which
he ate. I never saw the knife here exhibited
before to-day, and then it was in his body.—
I have no knowledge of the means by which
he procured his instrument. The first per-
son who visited deceased this morning, was Samuel
Colt, which was at about half past six o'clock. At
about twenty minutes of 8, William <u title="Dolson, Dolsens (elsewhere)">Dolsen</u> was
sent for to shave him; I was present in the cell
while he shaved him. Samuel Colt was the next
person who called, and brought Miss Caroline Hen-</l9>
<d>[Col.6]</d>
<l9>shaw with him. Then came Dr. Anthon, who
also entered the cell. John Howard Payne also
went it, and the Sheriff, Robert Emmett and David
Graham, Jr. His breakfast was brought in at
this time by a young man from Mr. Cowdrey's
victualling <u title="cellar">celler</u>—it was brought in a basket
and the contents taken out in my presence—
Dudley Selden was also in his cell during my relief
of Mr. Green. His brother, Samuel Colt, was with
him alone this morning; at the time that these per-
sons were in the cell, I was informed that the mar-
riage ceremony took place between the deceased
and Miss Henshaw. I have no knowledge of the
manner in which the knife was given to him. Miss
Henshaw came into the cell for the first time on
Thursday morning.
   A<small>BNER</small> M<small>ILLIKEN</small>, deputy coroner, was sworn.—
I have seen the body in the city prison, and recog-
nize it as the body of John C. Colt; the knife brought
in by me was taken from the wound inflicted on
the body of Colt; it was taken out by Drs. Hosack
and <u title="McComb">Macomb</u>.
   <u title="Abraham (elsewhere)">W<small>ILLIAM</small></u> H. G<small>REEN</small>, deputy sheriff, sworn.—I
have had charge of Colt since Monday afternoon at
intervals. I saw the handle of a knife resembling
the one here shown sticking from the body of Colt.
I do not know how it was brought into the cell; I
never made any search in the cell to ascertain whe-
ther there were any instruments in it to cause death.
   The instructions given to these deputies by the
Sheriff were handed to the Coroner.
   R<small>EV.</small> H<small>ENRY</small> A<small>NTHON</small> was called and sworn.—
My visitations commenced on Monday, and before
I proceed to be examined, I would wish to read the
notes I have taken each day. The Reverend gen-
tleman here commenced reading his notes, which
occupied some length of time. They contained a
diary of each day's interview with :Colt, in which
it appears that deceased expressed a belief in fu-
ture rewards and punishments, and that he united
with Dr. Anthon in prayer on Tuesday, at his se-
cond interview. On the third meeting he confessed
his belief in Christ, and the justice of his Creator.
He solemnly declared that he committed the mur-
der of Adams in self-defense, and said that he
should not die with a lie upon his lips, and that he
was prepared to meet his God with such a declara-
tion. He also complained against the publications
in some of the penny papers. The third interview
the question of suicide was alluded to, when he re-
plied that he had no such intention. His child and
mistress were spoken of, and upon a suggestion of Dr.
Anthon in relation to his marrying Miss Henshaw,
he said he would consult his friends and decide upon
it. In the interview on Friday he handed me the sum
of $500, which he said had been given to him by
his brother. I counted the money, and he requested
me to pay over to his intended wife $20 per month
as long as it lasted. I told him that I would stand
sponsor for the child, and give a receipt for the mo-
ney, as soon as they were married. I married them
about 11 o'clock, and Colt exhorted his wife to lead
a religious life, and endeavor to bring up the child
and educate it. I offered to take the child, and
bring it up as far as was in my power; but he said
his relatives desired to have the care of it. In the
last interview with him, which was about two
o'clock, he asked for a watch, which was given him
by one of the deputies, and he compared it with
the time of the Sheriff. On leaving him, I told him
to die with Christian fortitude—and he said, “Yes,
I will die with Christian fortitude.” I went to the
door of the cell in company with the Sheriff, and
found deceased lying dead on the cot. I know
nothing of the manner in which the knife was given
to deceased.
   C<small>OL.</small> W<small>M.</small> J<small>ONES</small>, keeper of the city prison, call-
ed and sworn:—John C. Colt was in my custody
from July 2nd to Monday afternoon last—since then
he has been in charge of the sheriff. I took a re-
ceipt from the sheriff when I delivered him over. I
have not seen deceased since Monday last. He
remained in the same cell after the sheriff took him
into custody as before. I searched his cell on Mon-
day morning of this week, but found no dangerous
instruments. We gave it a thorough search, and
was satisfied that there was nothing in his cell at
that time that we could find of a nature to destroy
life. I have never seen the knife here shown be-
fore, nor have I any knowledge as to how it came
into his cell. I had chains placed on his feet on
Monday.
   D<small>R.</small> J<small>OHN</small> R. <u title="McCOMB">M<small>ACOMB</small></u>, physician of the city pri-
son, sworn:—I visited the prisoner frequently until
Monday last, but have not seen him since. I have
seen his body—the knife here shown was in his bo-
dy—a hole was cut in his vest and shirt, about three
inches in diameter, and the knife was inserted half
an inch below the nipple of the left side, and be-
tween the fourth and fifth ribs—on the upper margin
of the fifth rib. I made a post mortem examination
of the body in company with Dr. Hosack—the knife
was inserted an inch and a half in the left ventricle
of the heart—he must have understood the anat-
omy of his body to have produced such a result. I
could not have done it better myself.—
On Monday last, deceased desired to borrow a
work on anatomy from me, but I refused to let him
have it—he then desired to know which of the ves-
sels in the arm would produce the easiest death, but
I told him I should not tell him.
   Dr. A<small>LEXANDER</small> H<small>OSACK</small> was called and sworn,
and confirmed the statement of Dr. <u>Macomb</u>.
   S<small>AMUEL</small> C<small>OLT</small>, brother of deceased, was then
sworn. I have no knowledge of the manner in
which the knife, here exhibited, was procured or
given to deceased.
   Mrs. C<small>AROLINE</small> C<small>OLT</small>, late Henshaw, was sworn.
I have no knowledge of the manner in which John
C. Colt became possessed of the knife with which he
committed suicide.
   The Coroner then addressed the Jury, stating that
the investigation had been continued for the pur-
pose of endeavoring to ascertain whether any per-
son had given the knife to deceased, in order that
he might commit suicide, as such an act would
render the person liable to an indictment for man-
slaughter. There being no proof to establish evi-
dence against any particular person, he said he
should pass the matter into their hands for a verdict
in accordance with the evidence.
   Some of the jurors requested to see the knife,
which was handed them, and they retired to a pri-
vate room to prepare their verdict.
   The Jury returned a verdict that John C. Colt
came to his death by a wound inflicted by himself
in his left breast with a knife, but the Jury are un-
able to say by what means he became possessed of
the knife.
   The body was enclosed in a coffin, and interred
in a vault in St. Mark's burying ground last even-
ing after the inquest was held.

<f12>THE LAST ACT OF THE TRAGEDY.</f12>
   All applications for the pardon or reprieve of Colt
having failed, the Sheriff of the county made the
necessary preparations yesterday for carrying into ef-
fect the sentence of the law. The prisoner having
requested that the hour of execution should be put
off as long as possible, the Sheriff agreed to delay it
until 4 o'clock, at which hour—in answer to an ap-
peal from Colt that he would hot hang him—the
Sheriff assured him that he must die. From an ear-
ly hour in the morning there was a constant rush to
the Tomb for admission to witness the awful cere-
mony, and some <i>three hundred persons</i>, it is stated,
were collected in the prison yard when the gallows
was erected. Of the events of the day we take the
following account from the Tribune:
<m9>   Colt was engaged nearly all night in writing a reply
	...
became red hot, and thus set the cupola on fire.</m9>
   An inquest was held last evening upon the body,
the report of which we have placed on our outer
page. Long after the verdict of the Jury was pro-
nounced, however, the crowd remained around the
Tombs, and it was impossible to satisfy the mass of
spectators that Colt was really dead. The long de-
lay, the repeated though fruitless trials for pardon or
reprieve, the <u title="announcement">announcment</u> of the suicide, the ex-
traordinary coincidence, certainly, of the fire, at the
very moment almost of execution—for, as Dr. An-
thon opened the cell door, the bell tolled out its first
alarm—all together, roused the feelings of the
crowd to a high pitch of excitement. As the night
advanced, however, the crowd began to disperse;
and thus ended a day, which, for excitement, has
been rarely equalled in this city—at all events, of
late years.

   The planet Venus was distinctly visible yesterday
from 3 o'clock P. M. to its setting—even when the sun
was shining very brightly—owing doubtless to the unu-
sual purity of the atmosphere. Groups of people were
collected at the corners of the different streets, speculat-
ing as to the cause of this unusual appearance; and the
popular imagination, what with the star, the suicide, and
the fire, ran wild.
   We have rarely witnessed more excitement than was
exhibited at and about the Tombs until a late hour last
night.

   T<small>HE</small> M<small>IDNIGHT</small> C<small>RY</small>!—Those who believe that
the conflagration of the world is to take place on
the fourth of July next—we think that is the
day—have established a daily evening paper in
this city, of which the first two numbers are before
us, bearing the title of the Midnight Cry.
   It gives some account of the breaking up of the
camp meeting at Newark. The substance of cer-
tain addresses made on that occasion by Miller, the
founder of the Second Advent sect, and Brother
Joshua V. Himes, editor of the Midnight Cry, are
given. Mr. Himes vindicated the sect from the
charge of fanaticism, and said that they pretended
to no inspiration or supernatural light, but merely
appealed to scripture history and sober argument.
He remarked:
<l9>   “<a title="Midnight Cry! 1842-11-17, Pg.3,Col.2" href="http://documents.adventistarchives.org/Periodicals/MC/MC18421117-V01-01.pdf">We have continual</a> calls to give lectures all
over the country; as we can't do this, we publish
books to speak for us. This they call a specula-
tion, and they say Brother Miller has made a for-
tune by his writings. Why he hasn't made enough
to pay for the paper and ink on which his books
were written. Others go round to preach against
us and charge 25 cents admission; we charge
nothing. We have pitched our great tent eight
times, in places 500 miles apart. The devil has
gone before us and circulated that we charge $1
for admission. We never did; we never thought
of such a thing. Our enemies have manufactured
the lie out of whole cloth.
	...</l9>
   Mr. Miller vindicated himself from the charge of
making a pecuniary speculation of his doctrines.—
He had nothing to do with the finances or the
books of the denomination. He owned, he said, no
property in the world, but a farm at Low Hampton,
and had erected no buildings except a small shed
or outhouse twelve feet square, on his farm, and
this was done by his son three or four years ago.
   It appears that the Second Advent Christians
have another newspaper at Boston, styled The
Signs of the Times. There is a number of cham-
pions of the doctrines of Miller, who are travelling
the country and giving public lectures.
   The Midnight Cry gives the following account of
Miller:
<l9>   William Miller was born at Pittsfield, Mass.,
Feb. 15, 1782. When he was four years of age, his
father removed to the town of Hampton, Washing-
ton County, New York, the present residence of
Mr. Miller. The country was then new, and his
means of education, till nine years of age, were
very small. His mother, however, taught him to
read, so that when he was sent to the common
school, he could read in the Bible, Psalter, and
an old Hymn Book, which at that time constituted
the whole of his father's library. After his ninth
year, he was sent to school three months in the
year, till he was fourteen. During this time he
was noted by his companions as a prodigy for learn-
ing, as they called it, particularly in the branches
of spelling, reading, and writing. At the age of
fourteen, he became anxious to obtain books to
read. The first history he obtained was Robinson
Crusoe; and the first novel he ever saw was Rob-
ert Boyle. He read them with avidity, and being
	...
   In the last war with Great Britain, he received
a captain's commission in the United States' ser-
vice, and served in the army until the twenty-fifth
of June, 1815, after peace was declared. He then
moved to his present residence, Low Hampton,
where<u title="SPACE (in MC)">, in </u>the year following, 1816, he was con-
verted from <u title="Deism (in MC)">deism</u> to the <u title="christian (in MC)">Christian</u> faith, and
united with the regular Baptist church in that
place, of which he is now a member in good standing.</l9>

   S<small>UICIDE OF</small> C<small>OLT</small>.—John C. Colt was to have
been executed yesterday morning, according to sen-
tence, for the murder of Samuel Adams; every
effort having been made to respite him, without
effect. Accordingly, the Sheriff (Monmouth B.
Hart, Esq.) yesterday, at an early hour, repaired to
the prison, the necessary preparations having been
previously made for the consummation of the awful
sentence of the laws. He visited him in his cell;
and, to appearance, Colt seemed to have regained
a possession of mind that he previously had main-
tained throughout the trial, &c., but which, within
the last few days, had deserted him.
   He was visited by several persons during the
forenoon, and about 12 o'clock, (no time having
been definitely fixed for his execution,) his brother,
accompanied by Caroline Henshaw, his mistress,
went to his cell, and at his urgent request the
Revd. Dr. Anthon united the ill-fated and wretched
man with that female in the holy bonds of matri-
mony, Messrs. John Howard Payne, David Gra-
ham, Justice Merritt, the Sheriff, Robt. <u>Emmett</u>
and his brother Samuel Colt being present to wit-
ness the ceremony.
   Soon after this, his brother and Caroline Hen-
shaw left the prison, and he then made a request to
be left alone as he had considerable writing to do
previous to the time of his execution, and which
he had himself requested might be deterred to the
latest moment that the law would allow.
   The Sheriff complied, and he was left alone from
about two o'clock, with the exception of one or
two persons visiting him in his cell to bid him
adieu.
   At about fifteen minutes before four o'clock,
(that hour having been appointed for the execu-
tion,) the Sheriff proceeded, in company with Dr.
Anthon and some other citizens, to apprize him
that the time for his execution had arrived, when
on the door being opened he was discovered lying
on the bed a corpse, having added the crime of
suicide to that of murder, by taking his own life
with a bowie knife, the blade of which was about
six inches long, and which had perforated his
heart.
   The interior of the prison was crowded, some
three or four hundred persons being present, and
anxiously awaiting his being brought out of his
cell to undergo the sentence of the law.
   On the fact being communicated that he had
destroyed himself, the excitement was intense, and
it was scarcely possible to convince the vast as-
semblage outside of the prison that such was the
fact.
   At this moment, an alarm of fire was given; and
it was discovered that the wooden tower, recently
erected over the vestibule of the prison, was on
fire.
<l9 id="Evening-Post-1842-11-19-Colt-Inquest">			THE INQUEST.
   The Coroner immediately apprised the Mayor
of the fact and issued his warrants for the appear-
ance of Dr. Anthon, Samuel Colt and the female
Henshaw, and at 7 o'clock convened a Jury of
twenty-two persons, consisting of the following
persons:
   Allen M. Sniffen, Joseph Keeler, Wm. H. Prall,
	...
   The panel having been sworn, the Coroner pro-
ceeded to the examination into the death of the
ill-fated man; the inquest being held in the Ses-
sion Court Room. The Mayor and Alderman
Smith supporting him on the right, and Alder-
man Crolius and Stewart on the left. The room
was crowded to excess.
   The Jurors were desired to leave the Court room
and view the body; this having been done, and
on their return from his cell, the theatre of the
suicidal act, the examination was proceeded
with.
   Monmouth B. Hart, (the Sheriff,) was the first

   The Rev. Dr. Henry Anthon, sworn—attended
Colt as his minister of the Gospel; had visited him
since last Monday, and had taken notes from that
time up to Thursday of what had taken place be-
tween Colt and himself—(he read his memoranda)
—it was merely a relation of religious interviews
or conversations, from which he came to the con-
clusion that the frame of Colt's mind in nowise in-
dicated any idea or intent to commit suicide, and
his averment of having committed the act in de-
priving Mr. Adams of his life in self-defense, com-
plaining bitterly of the stand the press had taken
against him; spoke of his child and the mother,
and felt disposed to make that mother his wife.—
Saw him this morning about 9 o'clock; expressed
his desire to be united to Miss Henshaw, and ma-
nifested a deep interest in the child—handed a
package containing $500, for its benefit, to the
witness, who proffered to become sponsor for it,
which was eagerly accepted by him. Soon af-
ter this, Mr. Saml. Colt, (his brother,) appeared
with Miss Henshaw and some other persons, and,
at his request in their presence, I united the pris-
oner to the female in the bonds of matrimony. My
last interview with Colt was about 2 o'clock; I
prayed with him, and he asked the time, and re-
quested that all who wished to take leave of him
would do so, as he wished to be left alone. I then
left him and went into an adjoining cell, where I
remained till the Sheriff came to me, nearly 4 o'-
clock, to give the signal for the execution, and
on going to Mr. Colt's cell beheld him lying dead
on the bed; had no knowledge how he obtained
the knife.
   The instructions of the sheriff to the deputies,
Vultee and Green, was here read, in which he di-
rected them to allow any intercourse to be permitted
between the prisoner and his friends, such inter-
course being always in the presence of one or other
of those deputized by him.
   William Jones, the keeper of the City Prison
was next examined, he delivered the prisoner over
to the sheriff last Monday evening, searched his
cell in the morning and found no dangerous wea-
pon. [The knife was here produced,] had never
seen that knife before. Colt was manacled while
I had charge of him.
   Dr. John R. McComb, (the prison physician)
sworn, I visit the prison daily, have done so for a
	...
day, he requested the loan of a book on anatomy,</l9>
<d>[Col.5]</d>
<l9>and to point out the arteries most easily reached, I
told him I could not comply with either request.
   Dr. Alexander H. Hosack, sworn, assisted Dr.

   Samuel Colt, (the brother of the deceased,)
	...
   <u title="Caroline">Catharine</u> Henshaw, (now Mrs. Colt,) sworn—
Had no knowledge how John C. Colt became pos-
sessed of the knife.
   There being no <i>evidence</i> that the knife was given
to the deceased by any person whilst in his cell.
The jury found a verdict of death by a wound in-
flicted by himself with a knife in his left breast, but
the Jury are unable to say by what means he came
possessed of the knife. He was 32 years of age;
born in Connecticut.
   Thus has terminated the mortal career of John
C. Colt, and perhaps a scene of such excitement
has never before been witnessed in this city as that
which seemed to pervade a large portion of the
community yesterday. Every avenue to the pri-
son was densely thronged throughout the day and
when the fact of his having committed suicide was
made known, the excitement can better be ima-
gined then described.
   His body remained in the prison, and will be re-
moved by his relatives this day for interment.
   The burning of the tower over the vestibule of
prison was purely accidental, a stove was lighted
and left burning, the attendants, from the excite-
ment and curiosity, having left it, and by some
means the wood work became heated and ignited.</l9>

   S<small>UICIDE</small>.—A man named Robert Darris, a native
of Ireland, a carpenter by trade, and who for a
number of years had lived and worked for Mr. Mo-
ris, of Morrisiana, Westchester county, was dis-
covered on Thursday morning in the work-shop,
in the act of committing suicide by cutting his
throat with a chisel, one of the implements of his
trade; he had so far accomplished his purpose
that it was found necessary to convey him to our
City Hospital, where he died yesterday morning at
eight o'clock, from the effect of the wound. He
had been partially deranged for the last three or
four days. Verdict, suicide by cutting his throat
with a chisel, being at the time deranged.

<f13>LIFE and LETTERS of JOHN C. COLT.</f13>
				——
			<m9>From the N. Y. Sun.</m9>
<l95>   The sentence of the law has been passed, and the
time of its execution is drawing hourly nearer to the
prisoner. Let us look at the life, adventures, and
character of a man whose approaching end is so tra-
gical.
   John C. Colt is of English descent, and he traces
his ancestry back to Sir John <u title="Colt">Coult</u>. His first Ame-
rican ancestor, John Colt, was born at Hartford, in
1658, his father having emigrated at an early period
of the history of that colony, from Colchester, Eng-
land. John Caldwell Colt was born at Hartford in
1810, and is consequently thirty-two years of age.
   His juvenile characteristics were a fondness for
<u title="boyish (elsewhere)">boying</u> sports, extreme bravery, or decision of cha-
racter; and great generosity of disposition, inclining
him to take sides with the weaker party in all juve-
nile quarrels. His daring was remarkable; so that
he seldom came to blows; and though often called in
as an arbiter, he had no quarrel of his own.
   At the age of twelve, Colt went to reside with an
uncle at Burlington, Vermont, an excellent man, who
appreciated his nephew's character, and was ex-
tremely attached to him. In one of his letters, this
uncle says—“I'll tell you what, John is made of good
stuff, and you need not give yourself any uneasiness
about him. He likes to have his own way rather too
much; but then he is always more than half right,
and where is the harm in giving him a little play?—
He is as kind hearted a fellow as ever was; and,
take him all round, I never saw a better boy in all my
life.”
   The following simple anecdote will illustrate one
point in his youthful character:—Going out one cold
winter morning to feed his uncle's sheep, our subject
found a stray lamb frozen to the ground in the snow,
and nearly dead. He told his uncle. Orders were
given for one of the men to kill it. Our subject im-
plored for the lamb, but in vain. When the man
came in with a stick to despatch it, he stood over the
little sufferer, and protested he would be killed him-
self sooner than let the lamb be killed. The uncle
coming up at the time, our subject renewed his en-
treaties, and was told, “Well you foolish fellow, take
the lamb to yourself, and do with it as you like.”
He flew for an axe, carefully cut the little creature
from the snow, put it into a basket, and carried it to
the house; where, after some six weeks' nursing, it
became hardy enough for removal to the stables, and
throve well, though from its once frozen feet, always
a cripple. And the grateful little cripple, followed
him about the farm.
   At this age, as often happens to boys of genius, a
singular change came over his mind. He thirsted for
knowledge. Heretofore, he had been more attached
to play than books; but now, the love of study, and
the desire to know, became a passion.
   He had attended school; and his application and
rapid acquirements gained him universal praise.
   He now wished to get a presentation for the Mili-
tary School at West-Point, his early passion, like that
of most young men of ardent<u title="SPACE (elsewhere)"> and </u>ambitious tempera-
ment, being for military glory. But he had a step-
mother, who ruled in his farther's house; and as is too
often the case, made it any thing but a comfortable
home to his children. She had decided that he should
engage in mercantile pursuits. He begged to be al-
lowed to attend Captain Partridge's Military School,
but this was denied. He then entreated to be sent to
College, but all the aspirations of his young ambition,
his misjudging relatives opposed.
   At fourteen, he was placed in a store belonging to
the Union Manufacturing Company, at Marlborough,
Connecticut. He performed the duties of this station
with such zeal and fidelity, though so contrary to his
inclinations, that he was made the agent's assistant
book-keeper at Manchester. His father, about this
time, took him on an excursion to New-York. It
seemed to him a paradise. On every hand were stores
of knowledge and food for thought. He found, too,
excitement, which, for a time, he entered into with
the zeal of early youth. His ambition to acquire an
education increased, and he determined to have one
at all hazards; with the profits of a year's clerkship
in his pocket, he left his situation, and came to New-
York. He, soon after, got from his father a promise
that he should be allowed to fit himself for College.
   At an academy near Hartford, he vigorously re-
sumed his classical studies. He labored night and
day, and astonished every one with his progress.—
Three months had glided away insensibly, though not
unprofitably; when, at the quarter's close, he was
surprised by a mandate from his father, requiring his
return home in the next mail stage.
   The influence of his stepmother was at work
against him. He left the home which she made un-
endurable, and went to Baltimore, unfriended, almost
pennyless, and but seventeen years of age. But it
was not long before he found employment as a teacher
of mathematics in a ladies' seminary; to which he
soon added further occupation, as assistant in a high
school.
   He made many friends by his excellent conduct
and remarkable talents; and among the rest, a gen-
tleman by the name of Everett, a canal contractor,
was so charmed with his energy, acquirements, and
excellent traits of character, that he offered him a
large salary to go upon the work, as an engineer, and
entrusted to his charge one of the most extensive as
well as difficult jobs on the north branch of the Sus-
quehannah.
   The young teacher was struck dumb with delight
and wonder. The work was beyond his expectations
and the salary offered him greatly beyond his hopes.
   At the age of eighteen, and entirely inexperienced,
he performed the labor of a Hercules, to the satis-
faction of his employer, but to the ruin of his own
health, and with the money he had saved of his wa-
ges, he went to Wilbraham, Massachusetts, resolved
to devote himself to study. He accordingly placed
himself under the tuition of the late President Fisk,
late President of the Wesleyan College.
   At home he had one beloved sister, around whom
twined every tendril of his heart. She was the only
being who made the thought of that home endurable
—and she became a victim to the persecution which
had twice driven him from the parental roof. She
could not fly into the world for refuge—but she found
it in the grave. Sarah Ann Colt died from taking
arsenic, in <u title="1819 (elsewhere), 1827 (in Herald-1841-09-29, Sun-1841-10-19)">1829</u>, at the age of twenty-one!
   The brother's soul was paralyzed. Every prompt-
ing of his ambition was drowned in the despair which
this most unhappy event occasioned. He resolved to
quit the country. Accident brought beneath his eye
a navy order for fitting out the frigate Constitution for
the Mediterranean. He resolved to get on board of
her, in any capacity. He hastened to Norfolk. But
how could he get on board the Constitution? He met
an intelligent acquaintance, attached to the marines,
and was persuaded to enlist in that corps. He pro-
posed to go to Constantinople, then to Alexandria, to
Calcutta, to Canton, and return home through South
America. It was a mad project, and he had not re-
flected that, enlisted as he was in the corps, such a
thing was impossible.
   The coarse fate, uncouth companionship, and ar-
duous duties of a soldier, soon cured him of his folly.
The excitement died away, and the state of mind
and body brought on by his situation produced a vio-
lent fever. After several weeks confinement in the
hospital, during which time the Constitution had
sailed on her cruise, he recovered, and procured a
discharge from Washington.
   We next find him engaged for one year, as a clerk,
at a small salary, in the office of Dudley Selden, Esq.
of this city, a distant relation of Colt. Mr. Selden
found his young kinsman regular, studious, and in-
dustrious, and became sincerely attached to him, as
he has shown in defending him in his late trial. Not
intending to study law, but wishing to qualify himself
as a civil engineer and teacher, he made arrange-
ments to take a year<u title=" of (elsewhere)">'s </u>instruction in mathematics in
the Vermont University. When his year was expired,
and he was about to take his departure, Mr. Selden
said to him, “Your father has sent me a hundred
dollars for you.” “Give it back to him, with my
thanks,” replied the son. He has said that he could
not, even destitute as he was, bear to receive sup-
plies from a fountain which had been sealed to his
poor sister.
  At the Vermont University, our subject was an in-
mate of the house of President Marsh, to whom he
became much attached. During his stay, he thorough-
ly mastered the theory of his designed profession. He
also became distinguished in a debating society of the
institution.
   The severity of his studies produced an attack of
bleeding at the lungs. His intended employment was
too full of exposure for his health, and he accepted a
partnership in a trading voyage up the <u title="Lakes (elsewhere)">lakes</u>. He re-
gained his health, made a small sum of money, and
bought him a farm in the most beautiful portion of
Michigan.
   But he was obliged to leave it, just when he had
become attached to it—for the terrible sickness that
prevailed made him fly for his life when reduced to
almost the last extremity. He sold his farm, and
made a tour in the South, visiting nearly all the valley
of the Mississippi, Florida and Texas. At New Or-
leans, to replenish his funds, he gave a series of lec-
tures on chemistry, with experiments. But getting
more pain than money, he engaged in more attractive
speculation, with more success.
  He spent the summer of 1834 in Louisville, Ken-
tucky, and at this time he gave his attention to book-
keeping, and in a year or two had amassed the ma-
terials for the work he afterwards published in Cin-
cinnati. For several years, 1835, 1836, and 1837,
he spent the summers in Ohio and Kentucky, teaching
and lecturing on book-keeping, and his winters in
trade and speculation <u title="at (elsewhere)">in</u> the South.
   Here we come to a romantic passage in his history.
He became acquainted with the daughter of a Nor-
wegian, a girl of singular character, rare beauty,
considerable accomplishments, and of a very roman-
tic disposition. Her manners, talents and situation,
won his friendship. His kindness won her devoted
attachment. He pursued toward her a course of vir-
tuous resolution—hers toward him was one of con-
cealed passion, to which she became a victim. Find-
ing her love returned by friendship only, she commit-
ted suicide.
	*	*	*	*	*	*
   He published his work on book-keeping, for which
his celebrity as a teacher and its own merits made an
extensive sale. He became deeply connected in the
book trade, opened a store with a partner, but while
he was absent at New-Orleans, he found that the af-
fairs of the firm had been so mismanaged that he was
obliged to close up his business with as little loss as
possible; and in April, 1839, he came to New-York,
and opened an office for the sale of his books.
   When he had accumulated, by exchange, a stock
of books, he would pack cases of them off to some
point for auction sale, or for a fresh exchange, and
thus kept his chances moving. He made his abode
at his office, and lived in a most frugal manner; sel-
dom visiting, and ever devoted to business. He per-
formed not only the manual labor of packing, but all
other duties of such an establishment; even, some-
times, that of a porter to convey packing-cases from
the ware-room to the passage below, without assist-
ance. The few friends who frequented his office, and
who remember these particulars, often, at the time,
used to smile at the array of boxes and the profusion
of paper strips, and the nails, and the hatchet or ham-
mer, and other tools—and the master's appearance
stripped to his shirt, and his sleeves rolled up, offici-
ating as his own man.
   He was moral and temperate in his habits, but was
on two or three occasions hurried into excess in wine,
by companions who took advantage of his general ab-
stemiousness; but after an <u title="affray (elsewhere)">affair</u> of this kind, a few</l95>
<d>[Col.2]</d>
<l95>years since so common, he found himself, or rather
was found by the watchmen, in a state of glorious
obliviousness, trying to get into an office in Wall street.
He was taken to the watch house, and discharged,
when he had slept off the fumes of the wine, next
morning. We should not have alluded to so trifling
an affair, had it not been used in the excitement at-
tendant upon his arrest for murder, and upon this
ground he was charged with an <u title="attempt">attemp</u> at burglary.
A reference to the police records will satisfy any one
who has the curiosity to make it.
   To stem the current of adverse times, he lectured
successfully in Boston and Philadelphia. In the lat-
ter place he became acquainted with a female in hum-
ble life, named <u title="Caroline (elsewhere)">Catherine</u> Henshaw. He had the
opportunity to do her some kindness, and she was
grateful—gratitude easily ripens into love. She threw
herself upon his protection—he educated her, even
teaching her to write. She joined him in New-York,
and they lived together, enjoying all the happiness
and living in all the proprieties of wedded life. Colt
had become so attached to her, that he had resolved
to have the marriage ceremony performed previous to
the birth of their child. He lived ad No. 42 Murray
street, and had his office for the sale and package of
books in a room in Granite building.
   With the subsequent events the public is well ac-
quainted.
   On the 30th of August there was to be what is
called a trade sale at New-York, and, on the 7th of
September, another at Philadelphia. On these occa-
sions new works go off in large quantities to the as-
sembled dealers, who frequently buy from a sample,
and pay either cash or bankable notes as soon as the
goods are furnished, for which some two or three
weeks are allowed.
   It appears that the balance of an unadjusted ac-
count was claimed by Samuel Adams. The account
was stated by him at $71.15, but only $55.80 was
admitted by Colt, of whose property at that very mo-
ment, stereotype plates, worth $500, were in the
hands of Samuel Adams, beside unbound books worth
as much more. It appears also that our subject was
impatient about some delay on the part of his prin-
ter in supplying the stock of books needed for realiz-
ing the proceeds of sales which had been effected to
the trade. While there was hurrying on the one side
and procrastination on the other, a suspicion on the
17th of September, 1841, was excited in the mind of
Samuel Adams that moneys expected by and belong-
ing to our subject, and “promised,” it is said, “by
him to Samuel Adams, would be withheld.”
   Under the excitement of this suspicion, Samuel
Adams went abruptly to the office of Colt, who, per-
haps, may himself not have entirely overcome his
chagrin at the want of promptitude in supplying his
work, to which we have already referred. It is on
record under oath, that Samuel Adams, when he heard
the remark that took him to Colt's room, “seemed
surprised, and there was a great change of counte-
nance,” and that a responsible person supposed it
likely that Samuel Adams was going to our subject's
office, “without doubt to insult him.”
   Between three and four o'clock in the afternoon of
Friday, the 17th of September, 1841, Samuel Adams
entered the office of our subject.
   Samuel Adams was seen no more; and at 2 o'clock
on Thursday, the 23d of September, 1841, John C.
Colt was arrested for his murder.
   This is a brief review of the life of John C. Colt.
The following is an account of him, given by one who
visited him in prison:—
   We found the prisoner writing at the table,
seated on the foot of the bed. I noticed a one-
volume octavo edition of Goldsmith's works by
his side. As the iron gates flew open, he rose,
he was not chained. His dress was a neat morn-
ing dishabille; he wore slippers and a dressing
gown. He received us with a very affable smile,
but not unmingled with an expression of anxiety
—handed one of us a chair, and waved the other
two to a seat on the bed, observing that he would
make no apologies about the scantiness either
of the space or furniture.
   I noticed his appearance intently. In height,
he is about five feet eleven. He is firmly built,
though slender. His head is large, his face oval,
his complexion light, his hair profuse, light
brown and richly curling; his nose aquiline; his
lips in silence always compressed; his eye of a
dark brown hazel, lighting up in conversation or
in listening, with great expression. The pre-
vailing characteristic of his countenance appears
to be gentleness, and his bearing is courteous
and manly. The tones of his voice are sweet
and mild but firm.
   The conversation, by some accident, presently
glanced upon the recent trial. The prisoner
spoke of it calmly, and commented on the conclu-
sions to which the jury had been led, as a mis-
take. He examined points in the evidence and
pleadings, and earnestly praised the eloquence
and skill of the Public Prosecutor, Mr. Whiting,
and of some others, who had acted most unre-
lentingly toward him. I was not a little asto-
nished to hear a person, under such circumstan-
ces, treat an event of the deepest possible solem-
nity in its consequences to him, as a mere spec-
tator. It struck me that in all he thought, there
appeared to be an entire self-reliance, coupled
with almost an incapability of admitting impres-
sions from other minds into his. This is the ef-
fect of misanthropy; but misanthropy is churlish,
and this man's manner is gracious and kind.
Surely some events of his life must have created
a spirit of distrust in him, without extinguishing
an innate spirit of amiableness.
   Such is the character, such has been the career
of a man, now chained in a cell in yonder prison
under sentence of death.
   The misfortune of being mistaken has followed him
through his life, and<u title=" he (elsewhere)"> </u>seems to have been a sport of
destiny. Judge Kent mistook the feeling of the re-
marks he was handed to read, and when the prisoner,
under the firmly endured but not less terrible agita-
tion of the moment, tried to explain, he made a re-
mark which was taken and reported more unfortu-
nately. He meant to say that his disposition led him
to resent an insult, and that the same causes operat-
ing upon his mind, would produce the same effect—
unknown and beyond control. There are thousands
of men, who, upon being called liar—scoundrel—or
swindler, would strike the man who said it—a blow
might lead to a scuffle—in a scuffle men become mad-
dened, the mildest are infuriated, and consequences
are no longer in their control.
   Where is the motive for a wilful murder—where
the advantage possibly to be derived from it, and
what is there in this man's character to induce us to
believe that he would deliberately take the life of
another? Yet a jury has convicted him, the judge
has sentenced him, the hour of his execution ap-
proaches, and thousands, we doubt not, are impa-
tient to have the awful punishment of death inflicted.

Dear Friend—
	*	*	*	*	*	*	*
   Do not believe the thousand false statements
you see heralded from day to day in the papers.—
Let them blow their blast. All that you hear now
is passion—passion. It is true there is a great
deal to excite; but at the same time, they use me
very unjustly. One-half that is said is for the pur-
pose of extorting black mail—at least with some
prints. Pay the very honest conductors of some
papers in this city, and they would soon turn the
current of public opinion, so far as to cause passion
to subdue, and set the reader to thinking and calm
reflection. They will hear nothing in my favor, re-
ceive no statements from me or my friends, unless
they are paid ten-fold the charge of an advertise-
ment—consequently they have all their own way.—
Since things are so, my friends have advised me to
keep cool, and bear all their horrid and unmerciful
inflictions. The tables may be some day turned,
and those who now seem to glut their appetite in
feeding upon my misfortune, may yet feel the scor-
pion lash of the pen to their soul's satiety.
   The man that meets with a misfortune now days,
becomes at once the victim of a certain portion of
the press. If he is poor, his friends are brought in
for a share, as mine have been, and placed upon the
rack, and tortured till money is forthcoming. But
in this case they will spill their ink to no purpose,
for it is not only my misfortune, but that of my
friends, as you know, to be without any very exten-
sive means.
   I will write you again more at large when in the
mood for scribbling. I cannot close without renew-
ing again my heartfelt gratitude for the kindness
proffered by you and friends, but let there be no
more to the effect you have proposed, as I assure
you it is entirely unnecessary.

   I know and pity the motives in which by far too
many of the severest attack are made, and would,
I assure you, if in my power, award to every writer
in the country so much gold as he could wish, and
say to them “henceforth, prey not on the calamities
of the unfortunate.”
   Do not believe that the statements made affect
me. I understand too well the motives that prompt
to abuse. It is only so far as they hurt the feelings
of my friends that they can cause me pain.
   Remember me to H—— and S——, and all the

   Dear Friend—Yours of the 11th inst was duly
received. Many of your inquiries, I cannot now an-
swer, although I should be glad to. After my trial
I shall feel at liberty to write more freely. I know
as little as you what will be the defence. My law-
yers are acquainted with all the facts. They say I
must leave all to them. The best way of managing
would be for me to state the facts, seal it up and
hand it to the court, and after the testimony is taken,
to open and read it. Should my statement be sus-
tained in analysis by the evidence, it would, in jus-
tice, in the mind of every reasonable being, amount
to an entire acquittal of the charge.
   This last plan may be considered by counsel too
risky, as the public press has excited the passions
of the people to an alarming degree. But I assure
you it would best accord with my feelings. The
idea of going forth in the world a suspected mur-
derer, is worse infinitely than much suffering. If I
throw myself upon my peers they will be likely to
believe me; but if I prove an alibi they will let me
go, but always wrongfully suspect I desired to kill
my antagonist. Were I west or south, I could
with perfect safety throw myself upon the country,
and with the evidence of Wells and Wheeler, if
they will but state the truth, be certain of an ac-
quittal. But in this city I am so little known, it is</l95>
<d>[Col.3]</d>
<l95>to be feared that passion and not evidence will de-
cide the case.
   Wells stated to my friends in some of their first
interviews, that “Adams left him in a vexed mood
or passion, and that he had no doubt but that he
went to my office and insulted me.” In some later
interviews he seems desirous of modifying his lan-
guage, or making a different statement. He is a
very timid man, and has I fear been cowed from
telling the truth.
   My keepers tell me that the prosecuting counsel is
going to Congress on my hanging, and I am told this
is publicly spoken of. Very pleasant, ah! If he be
an unprincipled, ambitious man, there is no doubt
but that he will do anything to win his case, and it
would certainly be quite a feather in a lawyer's cap
to get an innocent man hung. There was a time,
however, when men acquired popularity by defend-
ing the unfortunate, but now-a-days it would seem
by such reports that they are sent as legislators by
trampling upon the unfortunate. One thing is very
certain the prosecuting counsel never gave utterance
to such sentiments himself. I have no doubt, how-
ever, as he is a man of great professional pride, that
he will use his utmost to convict me.

   My Dear Sir—Although I stand condemned by
twelve men, do not think that it causes me so much
pain as you imagine. No—no. Death hath no ter-
rors for me. There is a world above this, and I
believe a just one. Men, at the worst can only de-
stroy the body. I did but defend myself against a
wanton, vile and unpardonable attack.—This I
would do again, at any time, when insulted and as-
saulted. No man would do less. His very nature
compels him to this.
   I have been tried and condemned for endeavoring
to secrete a misfortune, not for killing a man. Pre-
judice or error misled or governed the whole pro-
ceedings of the trial—justice took no part. The
time will come when men will look upon this whole
affair in its proper light—at least I believe so; per-
haps after I have suffered; and, believe me, truly,
sir, that I should prefer a thousand deaths and be
thought innocent, than live a single life, to be point-
ed at as guilty of a crime that my very soul would
shudder at the mention of, even from my boyhood
up. Do not think that I fear death. I have nothing
in this affair to reproach my conscience with. Be-
fore my God, within the frontal of Heaven, I can
exclaim to the man, “I was your friend—for this
you abused me. I asked you to be just—for this
you accused me of injustice. For calm words, you
gave me insulting language. For peremptory de-
nial, you gave me blows; for this you accidentally
fell a victim in a resistance to your wanton and un-
justifiable assault. Heaven protect the innocent
and unoffending in this affair—Heaven will be just!”
   My great suffering is for my friends. I care but
little for myself. This will be to them a heavy
blow. 'Twill wither up the very charity of their
hearts, and they will look with distrust upon all
around them.

   Dear Friend: Your kind letter was received
this morning. It is truly a great satisfaction to find
that it weighs nothing with you and friends; be-
cause I have been condemned by just twelve men.
One half were doubtless prejudiced, although they
may not <u title="have (elsewhere)">half</u> known it. Several we now know had
expressed an opinion that was hostile, before the
trial. There is so much said here by the press, on
all such affairs, that a man is first tried and condemn-
ed without a hearing. There is many an honora-
ble, worthy, and upright man connected with the
press; but there is at the same time many a con-
summate scoundrel. The good and just meaning
among them are, consequently, often forced into
such unjust reflections. Many an editor catches
half his ideas from rival prints, and not from the
multitude; and being honest himself, he believes
his contemporaries to be so likewise; consequently,
ignorance, falsehood, and prejudice promulgated,
and the people placing too much confidence in what
they read, are lead in error, and give vent to feel-
ings and expressions, that they in their calmer
moods would lament, could they but see correctly,
canvass facts, and separate truth from falsehood.—
A man must have been worse than blind not to
have observed this. Every thing is made to move
by excitement. Money is the great god that can
alone stay it. If a man is not rich, and meets with
a misfortune, he must expect to be damned. Mo-
ney, through the medium of the press, has, in this
country, as great an influence over courts of law, as
land, wealth and aristocracy under a monarchial
government, when the poet wrote——
<m9>	“<a title="THE TRAVELLER: OR A PROSPECT OF SOCIETY. A POEM By Dr. GOLDSMITH. Draw, Law...law" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=SeZbAAAAQAAJ&pg=PR23">Each wanton judge</a> <a title="THE POETICAL WORKS OF OLIVER GOLDSMITH. 1796. Pg.27, The Traveller.

Draws, Laws...laws" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=kScvAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA184">draws,</a>
	Laws grind the poor, and rich men rule the laws.”</m9>
   Justice is but a name, liberty but a shadow; give
me wealth, and I could put my foot upon the neck
of the universe. All the evidence of the least
importance in the case, in strict justice, was in my
favor.
   My case will be carried up on a bill of exceptions.
Perhaps it is best that the decision is as it was. I
may get a new trial, and be justly dealt with.—
Says Hume, “<a title="Never was Mr. Hume more just when he says, that..." href="http://books.google.com/books?id=j8IQAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA241">In many things the extremes</a> are
nearer to one another (justice) than the means.”—
Had the verdict been milder than it was, it might
have proven a total, irrecoverable, damnable blast.
There is ever a hope beyond injustice, rising like a
star of a cloudy night; true, it may come late, still
it replaces the heart, and the longer absent the more
welcome. But of the worst let come the worst, I
shall die as calm as ever man died. I have ever
had hopes beyond this world. Did I believe that
this existence was the beginning and the end, I
should curse the giver. No—impossible—it cannot
be. The universal world—the mighty heavens—
speak in signs more convincing than words, more
conclusive than argument, more appealing than pa-
rables—that there is a God above—just, mighty,
all-powerful. The <u title="balmy ? (elsewhere)">palmy</u> sunbeams, the sweet ze-
phyrs, the all-bountiful earth, proclaim his goodness
far more than justice, in myriads and myriads of
developments. No man should fear to shake off
this mortal coil—this dying, sickening, painful body
—this incarcerating prison-house to the mind—this
incubus to the heart—this chain of disease and cor-
ruption to the soul; give me the home of my fa-
thers!
   I am already at the close of the sheet. I did not
feel, when I commenced, like writing ten words.
But I no sooner take pen in hand to speak of myself
than my mind rolls to a fearful vividness, and my
bosom heaves and burns with pain that I cannot
quiet without too great a struggle. Say to J. and
F. that this must answer for you all. Do not ask
any more questions for a month. So long as life, I
shall remember the kindness of my friends. It is
enough now for me to know that they believe me
innocent.			Yours truly,

   Dear Tom: As you say, indeed mine is a hard
fate. All this misfortune has fallen upon me for
befriending that man. Had I not taken my binding
away from Mr. Ballow, and given it to Wells, for
the sake of throwing work in the way of Adams,
as Wells was to give work to Adams in accordance,
I should not now have been here by many degrees
of probability. Ballow is one of the finest men in
the world. He had done binding for me for the
past three yeas; and I had spoken to him about
binding the last edition, which he expected to have
done, as he <u title="stated, states (elsewhere)">state</u> in his evidence.
   But after this arrangement, Adams came to me
three or four times, and teased me till I consented
to give it to Wells, alleging that Ballow was well
to do, and that he himself had hard work to get cus-
tom. I knew that <u title="Adams's">Adam's</u> circumstances had been
in a sinking condition since the death of <u title="Scatcherd">Scatchard</u>,
his old partner, owing, I supposed, to his bad man-
agement. I never did any thing more reluctantly
than when consenting to let Wells do the work in
place of Ballow, and should not have done so with-
out the purest feelings of charity.
   Adams was at times a most aggravating fellow
in his language; but I had before always attributed
his manner to his ignorance, not to <u title="ill-will">illwill</u>. Howev-
er, I was mistaken.	*	*	*	*
He has been represented as one of the mildest and
meekest man the world has seen—a member of the
Church, &c. &c. In all which there is not the least
truth. While, on the other hand, my whole family
and myself have been abused—shamefully and
grossly abused.	*	*	*	*	*

   Dear Friends: That my pecuniary circumstances
as has been too frequently reported, were “strait-
ened and desperate,” was wantonly untrue. So far
from this, I felt myself well off in comparison with
the thousands I saw around me. The truth is, that
Adams was the man that was in straitened and des-
perate circumstances, and had been notoriously so
for the two previous years, and only permit-
ted to go on in his business by the lenity of his
creditors. The report that I was in straitened and
desperate circumstances originates from the fact of
my closing business in your city but a few months
before, that had proved unprofitable. But this was
done in good time, and had I not met with my pre-
sent misfortune, all my creditors would ere this have
been equitably settled with, as they were all secur-
ed.
   On winding up my business, I reserved means to
pay all my necessary expenses for eighteen months,
such as board, clothing and other necessaries of life,
and this means I would not appropriate to any other
use. I could have paid Adams' two-penny debt on
any day in the week. I offered to pay Wells to
hurry on the binding, which he refused, as he stated
in his evidence. It was also stated in evidence that
I had property valued, at a low estimate, at one
thousand dollars—stereotype plates, and the last
edition of the book keeping.
   Apart from this, I had diamonds and other jewel-
ry I could have turned into two or three hundred
dollars at pleasure. Besides, I was surrounded by
friends, as you are aware, from whom I could have
got money or credit, if I had wanted it. Notwith-
standing all this, in the very face of truth and evi-
dence, I was charged in court with killing this man,
(as the whole argument could rest on no other
ground,) for the paltry sum of fifty-five dollars and
eighty cents, the amount of my obligations, or as he</l95>
<d>[Col.4]</d>
<l95>had it on his books, seventy-one dollars and fifteen
cents, and that too under circumstances that render
such a supposition decidedly preposterous. But I
am wandering from the <u title="promise (elsewhere)">promises</u> of my last letter.
   Though not in “desperate and straitened circum-
stances,” as has been frequently alleged, yet my
circumstances were such as to require future and
not far distant exertions, which a succession of mis-
fortunes warned me to prepare for. This I had an-
ticipated on winding up my business in Philadel-
phia, and, consequently, I reserved my works on
accounts; works that I had been led to believe,
from a general adoption into our schools, and by un-
precedented and extensive sales, had done me some
credit.
   During the three monts previous to the unfortu-
nate encounter with Adams, among other matters,
I had employed myself in revising parts of this
work and getting out a new edition, as well as pre-
paring public addresses and a series of lectures on
accounts, as I contemplated and expected to re-
sume my old business as a public lecturer, so soon
as the full season for lecturing commenced. An
occupation 'tis very true 'tis very humble, but at
the same time one such that does no shame to an
honest man. So far as making money as a lecturer
on accounts, I felt no doubts of success. It was
what I had before succeeded in, what I had been
accustomed to, and as a public lecturer on this
branch of science, I had no competitors, as those
engaged on the subject were simple teachers of
what they found in books, after the common rou-
tine of school-teaching. With such reflections I
thought but little of past miscarryings, and felt as
though I could baffle and hurl back this tide of mis-
fortune with a stronger arm than ever, and though
“down I'd sunk, the higher up I'd rise.”
   Adams being a printer, and hereby connected
with the fraternity of the press, and the circumstance
of having killed him in my office, to which there
was no evidence then appearing to me, to hold up
to the public, of the one most in the wrong in the
quarrel, excepting the error in his accounts, I feared
if I divulged the misfortune that I might bid farewell
to my anticipated success as a lecturer; as all such
are greatly dependent on newspaper paragraphs.—
I was fearful that I should be followed with re-
proach, however unjustly, wherever I went, and that
to degree that would render success doubtful, if
not indeed futile in attempting.
   Together with my exertions as a public lecturer,
my future hopes were all wrapped up and dependent
upon the continuation of the popularity of my works
in our schools where they had been extensively in-
troduced, and were on the increase both in sales
and of adoption. It was used in seventeen semina-
ries out of twenty-three that instructed the science
in this city. It was used in about two hundred and
sixty schools throughout the country, and was the
only work sold in the great valley of the Mississip-
pi, where I had formerly held the field as a lecturer.
To what extent such a calamity would affect a
school book, in the midst of numerous excellent
authors, was impossible to conceive, and could only
painfully be reflected upon.
   Oppressed as you see from <u title="pecuniary (elsewhere)">peculiar</u> circumstances,
and the very natural and evil forebodings arising
from the <u>developement</u> of so great a misfortune,
when, too, a secretion by odds favored an entire
oblivion, right or wrong, I made up my mind, after
much struggle, to secretion, in the most rapid and
best way I could. If I came out with the misfor-
tune, ruin stared me in the face, while in an attempt
to <u title="secrete">secret</u> there was a hope, although a heavy hope,
to carry.
   My peculiar circumstances, as I above stated, al-
most alone took possession of my mind, and con-
trolled me. But, you may ask, “if you had not
thus been peculiarly situated, would you have come
out with the misfortune?” I think not, and the
reasons I will give in my next.

   Dear Friend—
	*	*	*	*	*	*	*
   You have indeed sent me a beautiful pack of ques-
tions, quite a number of which I have already an-
swered, as you will see by reading over my letters.
I will quote several of them, however, and give as
short answers as consistent.
   “When you had killed Adams, how came you
afterwards to go to his shop? and why did you call
on Mrs. Adams?”
   It was five or six days after the catastrophe that
I went to Adams's shop. You must recollect that
it was stated in evidence that I had about a thou-
sand dollars in property there, and it was necessary
to look after it. My only object in going at that
time was to request Mr. Monahan to see that the
stereotype plates were put into the vault, as they
had lately been used, and thus to preserve them
against fire or other accident.
   I might here enter into an argument showing the
positive absurdity of the grounds of the prosecu-
tion, which was, that “I killed Adams to get hold of
<u title="his (elsewhere)">this</u> property,” for there was never any attempt to
do so. So far from this, I even neglected to attend
to the binding and other business, from the great de-
pression of business and the unhappiness I felt.
   So far from calling on Mrs. Adams, I had never
seen her, to my knowledge, till she appeared in
court, and did not know till after the catastrophe
that Adams was a married man. You must have
read some of the mistaken newspapers to have ob-
tained this information. What kind of a woman
she is, is more than I can say.
   “Why did you strip the body of its clothing?”
   The clothing would have identified it years after-
wards. Any simpleton making up his mind to se-
cretion, would have done as much. See old letter.
   “Why did you ship the box to New Orleans?”
   Because it was a warm climate and the voyage
to said city would take from seventeen to twenty
days, and, consequently, agreeable to the common
course of nature, it would decay before any informa-
tion could be obtained to identify it. See old let-
ter.
   “I heard a person remark that the part of your
statement where you say you went to see your broth-
er in the evening, to relate to him this affair, and
ask advice, and then altered your mind, and did not
disclose it to him, looks improbable.”
   Whoever says this must speak without reflection,
or believe me quite ignorant and incapable of rea-
soning. The first natural impulse was to seek the
advice and aid of a friend. But had I related the
fact to him, it would have made him an accomplice
in the secretion; and if by any accident during
that attempt a <u>developement</u> had been made—such
as the box sliding from the stairs and bursting open
or <u title="that (elsewhere)">had</u> the drayman's horse ran away, or it had fal-
len from the <u title="tackle">tackel</u> when being lowered into the ship,
or that the building had taken fire during the time and
persons had bursted into the room. Under such a de-
velopment it would readily have been constructed
into a conspiracy, and both certainly been hung.
To have related the facts to him, would have been
to have endangered his life as well as to render my
situation more precarious.

   Dear Friend,—

   I have no doubt if I had at first returned Adams'
abusive language after his own manner, instead of
being mild as I was, that the quarrel would have
ended in smoke. But the man evidently construed
my mildness into fear, and when he became so abu-
sive that I could no longer contain myself, and turn-
ed his language upon him, he gave me a slap with
the back of his hand across the mouth, which blow
was instinctively returned and we were in a strug-
gling fight, which soon ended in his fall, but which
I assure you has left me in immensity of pain, and
deep and lasting sorrow. I even wish sometimes
that I had fallen myself.

   Friend R.—To your inquiry, “what kind of a
man was Adams?” I will leave you to form your
own opinion from a simple fact that has been rela-
ted to me since my trial.
   Three or four years ago <u title="Scatchard (elsewhere)">Scratchard</u>, the partner
of Adams, died. His property was invested in his
printing establishment jointly with Adams. On his
death-bed he left all in charge of this man, Adams,
having received a promise from him that he would
first pay out of his effects his funeral expenses, then
the debts he owed, and the balance he would pass
over to his wife and children. So far from fulfilling
the promise he contrived to wrong <u>Scratchard</u>'s
widow out of everything, and carried his principles
to so far a length as to refuse to pay even the five
dollars to the grave digger of poor <u>Scratchard</u>, which
sum was subsequently raised by Mr. George Long,
bookseller, in this city, by subscription, with other
small sums that bought shoes, etc., for poor <u>Scratch-
ard</u>'s children.
   This was perhaps a development of his true cha-
racter. But all that relates to the truth of this
man's character has been most artfully and assidu-
ously kept hid from the public. Those of his own
craft, but a few of them do not know his real cha-
racter. Why, there are not five printers in the
country that would not sell the very coat from off
their back before they would refuse to pay for <u title="digging">dig-
ing</u> the grave of a partner in business that they had
lost. But he suffered too much from my hand for
me to mention his faults. I hope sincerely, most
sincerely, that his spirit now exists happily in hea-
ven.
   The widow <u>Scratchard</u> and her family now reside
at Brooklyn, and will at any time testify to this
fact, as well as Mr. George Long, in this city.—
What kind of a man do you think Adams was?

   Dear Madam—
	*	*	*	*	*	*
   Do you ask me, “Do I read and believe in the
Bible?”
   One at all fond of history, or of a curious book,
will certainly read the Bible. As a book of history
it is invaluable from its antiquity; and regarding it
only as a fable, it certainly the most curios book
extant. Bu what is and what is not the intent and
meaning of many of its passages, admits of very
different degrees of opinion.
   I hardly know by your question what kind of an</l95>
<d>[Col.5]</d>
<l95>answer you seek. If you wish to know whether
I spend weekly so many hours upon my knees in a
repetition of so many words and phrases, denoting
in language ideas—or so many hours in conning
over the chapters of the Bible, I must say I
do not. I only do those things when the spirit
moves. I assure you that I have read the Bible
more than once thoroughly, and parts of it often,
and with love and admiration. Christ's sermon
on the mount, as given in Matthew, chaps. 6 and 7,
may be read with never-tiring pleasure. There is
in it a beauty of language enchanting the soul, and
a purity of thought which carries man in concep-
tion beyond his nature. It has never been equalled
by the eloquence of any other being. It is only
surpassed in the mute, but all-powerful and never-
ceasing eloquence of Nature and Nature's God.
   I believe in the Spirit of the Bible, at least in the
first religion therein taught on the infinite punish-
ment:—Man we hope is intended from the begin-
ning of his existence to remain for ever a being in
existence—in a spiritual existence if not physical.
His acts, however, all of them in this corporal exis-
tence, are finite, and although he may sin, and that
too against an infinite God, still that God is one of
infinite goodness. Agreeably to my views, it is as
absurd to suppose that the Creator would inflict an
infinite punishment upon one of his creatures for a
finite action, as it is to suppose in the first place
that he created man as sin. Man is doubtless pun-
ished according to the deeds done in the body.
   Religion I believe is, and ever has been an insepa-
rable ingredient with man's soul, that it consists
in a simple love, thankfulness and reliance in God.
The Indian, who never saw the Bible but worships
the Great Spirit, and thinks his Maker moves at
times in the music of the bubbling waters and the
swift wind, is, in my mind, as certain to be saved
as we who repeat long prayers in the synagogue and
listen to the music of organs.
   I sincerely think that the Bible is an inspired book,
and intended as a guide to man. It is certainly
marked with such features as will keep it a thing
apart, or in contradistinction with all other works.

			and hopes in the future

Dear Friend—
   You will see by looking over the New York <a class="l" href="#1842-09-28">pa-
pers of this morning</a> that <a class="l" href="#Herald-1842-09-27-Col6">I was sentenced yesterday</a>.
This was necessary before my case could be carried
up to the Court of Errors. It had been my inten-
tion on this occasion to make some remarks to the
Court of a very different meaning to those you see
reported. But I supposed I should not be sentenc-
ed till the last day's sitting of the Oyer and Termi-
ner, and consequently, had kept my mind as much
occupied as I could in other matters, that I might as
far as possible forget my troubles.
   I did not know till late on the day before that I
was to be sentenced so soon, and the remarks you
see printed which I handed to the Court to read,
were written under intense feeling. The object of
writing them was to avoid the customary remarks
of the judge that usually accompany such sentences.
I see nothing now in the remarks that the Court
read for me that I think should have been altered,
excepting the word “trample,” used in three con-
secutive sentences. It would have been better to
have used the word “mistook.”
   The word “trample,” as there used, seems harsh,
although not intended to be so. But you know how
it is when one desires to do any thing exactly right,
when not prepared, nine times out of ten it is done
exactly wrong. I suppose I wrote over twenty
different statements the night before, for I was up
and down all night, and in too much distress to
sleep.	*	*	*	I should have read the paper
myself, instead of handing it to the Court, had I not
felt at the time so unnerved and weak as to have
rendered me incapable of getting through with it.
   The Judge unfortunately for me, you will per-
ceive, took the statement in high dudgeon. He mis-
took entirely the meaning of the statement itself,
as well as the purity of my own intent, and came
down upon me like a hurricane, as he struck the
paper upon the desk, in a manner of probably un-
conscious violence. Had the Court received my
statement with kindness, I believe I should have
sunk entirely down. But the way it was received
thrilled through and strengthened me as a breath
of <u title="protoxide">prot-oxyd</u> of nitrogen; and, consequently, in ad-
dition to the Court, had I have had the whole City
Hall upon my back, I should irresistibly have shaken
it off. Push any man, under any and every circum-
stance, beyond a certain point, either by miscon-
struction of <u>other wise</u>, and irresistibly he turns
upon you, although by every sense of inward feel-
ing, he sincerely desires to avoid all differences be-
tween himself and his fellow men.
   By reading my explanation, as you will see re-
ported, you will perceive that I spoke from an invo-
luntary impulse, as my language was entirely un-
guarded. One expression that I used is particular-
ly unfortunate in my present situation. It was this,
as I said, “I never committed an act in my life that
I would not have done again under similar circum-
stances.” This is not an uncommon expression for
the best of men to make. But to render it intelli-
gible to many readers, it requires a metaphysical
construction. The meaning is simply this:—“In
all my acts of life, so far as within my own control,
I have endeavored to do what I conscientiously <u title="thought (elsewhere)">tho't</u>
was right at the time I acted.” To construe such
a sentiment, used by any one, so as to make it ap-
pear that he never lamented a misjudgment, or
would not profit from experience, is to make him out
no less than a madman or a fool.
   We all know, from the experience taught by ma-
ny of our acts in life, that we should act very, very
differently, had we go to over them again, from the
fact, that the same causes or influences operating
upon the mind produce, at different times, different
effects—at another, from physical or mental disabil-
ity—while, at all times, the heart is pure, and the
intent is to do what we suppose to be right at the
time we act.
   Why is the question asked, why sentence of death
should not be pronounced, if the prisoner is not pri-
vileged to make a reply? And if any reply is made,
be it ever so exceptionable, should it not, under
such extreme circumstances as this, be received
with kindness, if it be singly with an eye to the frail-
ties of poor human nature?

   <a title="The Sydney Morning Herald. September 8, 1842" href="http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/12425819">A savage murder</a> <a href="http://newspaperarchive.com/uk/middlesex/london/london-morning-post/1842/04-04/page-3">is</a> committed, the barbarity
horrifies the public, the assassin is execrated; he
is tried, convicted and sentenced to death, and from
that moment the horrible murderer becomes the ex-
emplary penitent, with whom pious ladies pass hours
in prayer and tender discourses. The local paper
which before teemed with details of the criminal's
atrocities, is now full of traits of his saintly state of
mind, his devout spirit, his edifying resignation, and
above all, his sayings in acknowledgment of the
services of the chaplain, who has opened to him
the promise of the glories of the other world; and,

against a most barbarous murder. Such are the
honors and favors peculiarly reserved for crime and

in patience, how much guilt would be averted,
how much goodness sustained!—<i>London Examiner</i>.</l95>

		<b>JOHN C. COLT.</b><!-- Some text is from Geneva-Advertiser-1842-11-25 -->
   This man of violence and blood terminated his
own existence yesterday in a violent and bloody
manner. The persevering and determined efforts
of his Counsel, to avert the execution of his sen-
tence, had awakened deep and pervading public
feeling. Up to 8 o'clock yesterday morning, Colt
and his friends were confident that a respite would
be obtained. The answer of the Chancellor to the
application made to him on Thursday, cut off their
last hope; and the Sheriff, notwithstanding the
Protest of Colt's Counsel, reluctantly proceeded to
make the necessary preparations for the discharge of
his painful duty.
   Colt requested that his Execution should be de-
ferred until the last moment, and in pursuance of
that request, F<small>OUR</small> o'clock was designated as the
fatal hour.
   During the previous day and night Colt was en-
gaged in writing, for publication, a Review of Gov.
S<small>EWARD'S</small> Letter and a more detailed account of
his conflict with Adams.
   In the forenoon of yesterday Colt's Brother and
his Counsel, Messrs. G<small>RAHAM</small>, E<small>MMET</small>, and S<small>ELDEN</small>,
passed some time in his cell.
   At 12 o'clock C<small>OLT</small> was married to C<small>AROLINE</small> M.
H<small>ENSHAW</small>, by the Rev. Mr. A<small>NTHON</small>, in the pre-
sence of a few of the <u>convicts</u> friends. She remain-
ed with him until after 2 o'clock and then left the
Prison with Colt's Brother, neither of whom re-
turned.
   Having now taken leave of other friends, C<small>OLT</small>
requested to be left alone in his cell, the door of
which was closed.
   A few minutes before 4 o'clock Sheriff H<small>ART</small>,
Deputy Sheriff W<small>ESTERVELT</small> and the Rev. Mr.
A<small>NTHON</small> proceeded to his cell, upon opening which
C<small>OLT</small> was found upon his bed with a dirk thrust be-
tween his ribs into his heart! Doct. H<small>OSACK</small> pro-
nounced him dead!
   Simultaneously the Cupola of the Prison was dis-
covered to be on F<small>IRE</small>! The cry, “<i>Colt has commit-
ted suicide!</i>” “<i>The Tombs are on Fire!</i>” resounded
through the city. Thousands rushed among the
thousands that already surrounded the Prison, the
Dome of which was enveloped in flames, while the
interior of that great reservoir of crime and misery
was appalled by a scene of self-murder!
   Outside the prison, whose walls were beleaguered
with tens of thousands of citizens, all intensely ag-
itated by scenes so exciting, <small>ORDER REIGNED</small>! We
mingled for a long time with that vast multitude
without hearing an expression or witnessing an act
inconsistent with that S<small>UPREMACY OF THE</small> L<small>AWS</small>
without which there would be no security for our
Government, our Institutions, or our Lives.
   The first impression of the People collected about
the Prison was that the suicide was a <i>ruse</i>, but this
opinion, to a great extent, gave way to the positive
assurances of gentlemen who came out, saying they
had seen the dead body.
   The Coroner had locked the cell and proceeded to
summon an Inquest, which we understood was to
be held over the body at 7 o'clock last evening.
   The fire was evidently designed to create, at the
moment of the expected Execution, alarm and con-
fusion, and with the hope of a rescue or an escape.
   It was generally understood in New York that an
effort was made to induce two of the Keepers to
allow Colt to escape in female attire.

   <i>Colt's Life and Letters</i>.—The Life and Letters
of J<small>OHN</small> C. C<small>OLT</small>, which we copy to-day, from the
New York Sun, were all, or in part, among the
Papers submitted to Gov. S<small>EWARD</small>, and upon which
the Application for Pardon was based.
		———————
   ☞ There were many and strong doubts existing
in New-York, when the Boat left at six o'clock last
evening, whether C<small>OLT</small> was dead. The conduct of
the Sheriff and Keepers, in leaving him for an hour
and a half alone, in his cell, immediately before the
time of execution, excited general surprise and sus-
picion.

fate of Mary Rogers, is at length withdrawn. The

   <i>V<small>ENUS</small></i>.—This lovely planet which now shines so
brilliantly after sunset in the western sky, is at pre-
sent at its greatest brilliancy, and may be distinctly
seen in the <i>day time</i> with the <i>naked eye</i>. The pe-
culiar coldness and clearness of the atmosphere at
present renders it even more than usually distinct.
Even in New York, notwithstanding the smoke and
impurities of her atmosphere, it was seen by thou-
sands during the clear cold weather of yesterday.
Broadway itself seemed to have lost its attractions
for the time, and every eye was upturned to obtain
a view of the 'lovely goddess.'
   It will continue to be visible even at noonday, for
some weeks to come. It follows some ten degrees
below the path of the sun, and about 40 degrees to
the east. In another month it will again be lost in
the more brilliant light of the sun.		M. J. N.
