   ☞ ANOTHER TEST of the efficacy of Dr. J. L. PA-
RIS'S SOOTHING SYRUP for Infants Teething, from Mr.
Wm. Johnson, 248 Hudson Street, New York.
   Dear Sir—The great benefit afforded to my suffering infant by
your Soothing Syrup, in a case of protracted and painful dentition
must convince every feeling parent how essential an early applica-
tion of such an invaluable medicine is to alleviate infant misery
and torture. My infant when teething, experienced such severe
sufferings, that it was attacked with convulsions, and my wife and
family supposed that death would soon release the babe from an-
guish, till we procured a bottle of your Syrup, which, as soon as
applied to the gums, a wonderful change was produced, and after
a few applications, the child displayed obvious relief, and by con-
tinuing in its use, I am glad to inform you the child had complete-
ly recovered, and no recurrence of that awful complaint has since
occurred; the teeth are emanating daily, and the child enjoys
perfect health. I give you my cheerful permission to make the
acknowledgment public, and will gladly give information on the
circumstance.						WM. JOHNSON.

			ON LOW SPIRITS.
<m9>   ☞ Low spirits is a certain state of the mind, accompanied
by indigestion, wherein the greatest evils are apprehended upon the
slightest grounds, and the worst consequences imagined. An-
cient medical writers supposed this disease to be confined to those
particular regions of the abdomen technically called hypochon-
dria, which are situated on the right side of that cavity, whence
comes the name hypochondriasis.
				<small><u title="SYMPTOMS">SMPTOMS</u>.</small>
   The common corporeal symptoms are, flatulency in the stomach
or bowels, acrid eructations, costiveness, spasmodic pains, giddi-
ness, dimness of sight, palpitations, and often an utter inability of
fixing the attention upon any subject of importance, or engaging in
anything that demands vigor or courage. Also languidness—the
mind becomes irritable, thoughtful, desponding, melancholy, and
dejected, accompanied with a total derangement of the nervous
system. The mental feelings and peculiar train of ideas that
haunt the imagination and overwhelm the judgment, exhibit an in-
finite diversity. The wisest and best of men are as open to this
affliction as the weakest.
				<small>CAUSES.</small>
   A sedentary life of any kind, especially severe study, protract-
ed to a late hour in the night, and rarely relieved by social inter-
course, or exercise, a dissolute habit, great excess in eating and
drinking, the immoderate use of mercury, violent purgatives, the
suppression of some habitual discharge, (as the obstruction of the
menses,) or long continued eruption; relaxation or debility of one
or more important organs within the abdomen, is a frequent
cause.
				<small>TREATMENT.</small>
   The principal objects of treatment are, to remove indigestion, to
strengthen the body, and to enliven the spirits, which may be pro-
moted by exercise, early hours, regular meals, and pleasant con-
versation—the bowels (if costive) being carefully regulated by
the occasional use of a mild aperient. We know nothing better
calculated to obtain this end, than Dr. Wm. Evans' Aperient
Pills, being mild and certain in their operation. The bowels be-
ing once cleansed, his inestimable Camomile Pills, (which are
tonic, anodyne, and anti-spasmodic) are an infallible remedy, and
without dispute have proved a great blessing to the numerous pub-
lic.
   Some physicians have recommended a free use of mercury, but
it should not be resorted to; as in many cases it will greatly ag-
gravate the <u title="symptoms">symtoms</u>.
   The medical office of Dr. WM. EVANS is at No. 100
Chatham st., and at No. 19 North Eighth street, Philadelphia;
where his Camomile, as well as his excellent Family Aperient
Pills, may be obtained. Sold also by his advertised country

that the afflicted receive of the beneficial results of medicines,
I cheerfully offer mine to the public, in behalf of Dr. Wil-

last ten years, with distress in the head and chest; often so
bad as to deprive me of sleep for three or four nights in suc-
cession, but have never found relief by any of my friends'
prescriptions, until my wife saw the advertisement in the pa-
per; when she persuaded me to send for some, which I did,
and obtained two boxes and bottles, which resulted in al-
most completely restoring me to health, although I have not
yet entirely finished them. Should you consider this any

effected by the treatment of Dr. WM. EVANS.—Mr. John
Gibson, of North Fourth street, Williamsburgh, afflicted
with the above complaint for three years and nine months,
during this time he had to use crutches. His chief symptoms
were excruciating pain in all his joints, but especially in the
hip, shoulders, knees, and ankles, and aggravation of the
pains towards night; and for the most part all times from
external heat, an obvious thickening of the fascia and liga-
ments, with a complete loss of muscular power. For the
benefit of those afflicted in a similar manner, Mr. Gibson
conceives it meet to say that the pains have entirely ceased,
and that his joints have completely recovered their natural
tone, and he feels able to resume his ordinary business.

<b style="letter-spacing:.2em"><cl>C</cl>HILDREN TEETHING.</b>—Children generally
suffer much uneasiness from the cutting of their teeth.—
Whatever dangerous or fatal symptoms attend the process of na-
ture, they are produced invariably from the highly irritated and
inflamed condition of the parts; therefore the principal indications
of cure are to abate the inflammation, and to soften, soothe and
relax the GUMS. If that is effected the infant is preserved from
subsequent fever, infatuation, spasmodic cough, twitching of ten-
dons, croup, canker, and convulsions displaying their fatal conse-
quences. If mothers, nurses or guardians have their babes tortu-
red with painful or protracted dentition, and this notice attracts
their attention, they should not be deterred from purchasing a
bottle of Paris' celebrated SOOTHING SYRUP FOR CHIL-
DREN TEETHING—the incomparable virtue of which in
completely relieving the most distressing cases (where applied to
the infant's gums as directed) is invaluable. The remedy has re-
stored thousands of children when on the verge of the grave to the

<d>[Col.1]</d>
   <i>Dreadful Affray</i>.—Yesterday morning about 4 o'clock,
the coroner was called to the house of Lawrence <u>Gaff-
ny</u>, corner of Broome and <u title="Willett">Willitt</u> streets, to examine
<s>into</s> the case of Peter <u>Fitz Patrick</u>, lying there in a dying
state, from the effects of a blow which he had received
about an hour previous at that house. From the evi-
dence of Lawrence <u>Gaffny</u>, it appeared that he had
opened the house about three days before, and gave a
house warming, as it is termed, on Tuesday night, ha-
ving there about <s>??</s> of his friends, and a fiddler to enliven
the <s>wake</s>. He only occupied the lower floor, consist-
ing of a front room used for selling liquor, and the back
room occupied by his family. Every thing went on very
well until about two o'clock in the morning, when one
of his company having imbibed too much blue rum, be-
<s>came</s> somewhat noisy. Just at this time, (according to
Gaffney's statement,) four young men came into the front
room, one of whom went into the back room where the
company was assembled, and as the other was attempt-
<s>ing to go in</s>, Gaffney said he had better not, when he re-
<s>????</s> from the door. The young man who went into the
<s>back</s> room soon got into trouble with some of the men,
<s>?????</s> came out, clinched with one of Gaffney's com-
<s>pany</s>. Gaffney parted them, and telling him that if he
<s>would</s> not behave civilly, he had better go out, put him
<s>out of the</s> front door, his friends following very quietly.
Very soon afterwards the front door was forced in, and
<u><s>Fitz</s> Patrick</u>, who was standing close to it, turned round
<s>to</s> see who was the intruder, when he received a stab in
<s>??????</s> groin, which cut through the femoral vein, and
<s>???? him</s> lying on the floor in a deplorable condition.
<s>Two others</s> of the company, named Peter Delaney and
<s>Edward Denman</s>, came up at once to see the affray
<s>that</s> was going on, when they received wounds from the
<s>same person</s> who stabbed <u>Fitz Patrick</u>, which are likely
<s>???rove</s> fatal, Delaney being stabbed in the abdomen,
<s>?????</s> navel, and Denman over the right temple, both
<s>??? severely</s> and in all probability mortally.
   <s>The</s> authors of this disgraceful outraged then cleared
<s>?????</s> though pursued made out to effect their escape.
<s>?????</s> Wright, a watchman, stationed on that post, and
<s>?????</s> near the scene nearly the whole time, was ex-
<s>amined, but his</s> testimony amounted to nothing, he hav-
<d>[Col.2]</d>
ing been most dreadfully frightened, or most stupidly
ignorant—or his testimony has been wofully misrepre-
sented. He stated that he saw four young men come
to the door of Gaffney's house, where they waited about
<s>15</s> minutes, and he then advised them to go off, which
advice they took, and departed. Soon afterwards his
attention was attracted to a female going along bare-
headed, and while speaking to her, he heard a noise in
Gaffney's house, and ran back to see what it was. When
he got there, he saw a young man (one of the four who
had been there before,) stab a man (on the inside of the
door) with a knife or dirk, and the wounded man falling
upon him, rolled him nearly into the gutter, and by the
time he could get up and give the alarm rap, the rioters
were off.
   Yesterday four young men, whose names are annexed,
were held to bail by the Coroner in $300 each, to appear
and testify in this case. They stated that they were
among the party concerned; that they, and one other,
named John Scott, were at Frost's oyster house, in Grand
street, and started to go down to Gaffney's to see what
was going on, having been informed that there was a
muss there. The rest has been already detailed, and
suspicion is firmly fixed upon a young man named <u>Israel</u>
White, as having committed the outrage, for Gaffney
and the other witnesses testified that the companions of
White did not aid or abet the person who committed the
outrage at all, but remained peaceable. The names of
the four held to bail are Alfred Pierce, 18 Cannon
street, Wm. H. <u title="Hales (elsewhere)">Hale</u>, 22 Cannon street, Wm. Timp-
son, East Broadway, and John Pelzer, 568 Grand street.
A young man named Wm. <u>Bloom</u>, was yesterday after-
noon arrested by Marshals Pierce and Woolly, charged
with having participated in the outrage, and was reman-
ded for further examination.
   <u>Fitz Patrick</u> died soon after the coroner left him, but
was unable to speak from the moment of receiving the
wound. The others are now at their homes, Delaney
at <s title="34 OR ??">94</s> Pitt street, and Denman corner of <u title="Willett">Willitt</u> and De-
lancey streets, both in very precarious situations.
   In the case of <u>Fitz Patrick</u>, the jury returned a verdict
that the wound of which he was then dying, (at the time
of the inquest) was inflicted by some person or persons
unknown.
   The above are all the facts that could be gathered from
the minutes as taken by the Coroner, and it will be seen
that it is left to conjecture how many persons were con-
nected in the affair, and in fact the reporter has inserted
one more name than appears in any part of the testimo-
ny that was placed at his disposal. This case is likely
to be one of great and exciting interest, and should a
trial ever come on, the coroner's minutes would be of
little more service than would the evidence of a person
who had never heard of the transaction. In such cases
as the present, <i>minutiae</i> are sometimes the only link in
the chain of evidence, that can fasten the guilt upon the
proper persons, and unless these are more attended to, a
coroner's inquest might readily be avoided, were it not
for the $<s>5</s> fee allowed by law. To show that this is not
written without proper motives, we will mention one or
two facts. One young man (<u>Bloom</u>) has been arrested,
because he tallied with the description given by a watch-
man, but he has not been confronted with either of the
men, who are now probably dying, to ascertain if he
could be recognized as a participator in the outrage.
The principal witnesses (Gaffney and the watchman)
swear there were four men concerned, and four have
already been held to bail to appear and testify; one has
been arrested on suspicion, and a warrant is out against
another, making six. This discrepancy is not explained
by any evidence taken before the coroner. This is de-
cidedly wrong, and if the three or four rubs that Mr.
Coroner Wheeler has received at the hands of the Dis-
trict Attorney when trying murder cases, (he having felt
the want of such testimony) is not sufficient, some other
and more public method must be taken to make him ac-
quainted with his duties and responsibilities.

though severely wounded in the abdomen, Dase
did not discover it until he had walked some dis-

   M<small>URDER</small>.—About two weeks since, Lawrence
Gaffney hired a house at the corner of Willett and
Broome streets, which he fitted up as a tavern. On
Tuesday, he invited a party to “a house warming.”
Every thing went on peaceably, and in the most
perfect good humor, until about 2 or 3 o'clock,
when ten or fifteen young men came to the house
and entered the bar room. Hearing music in the
adjoining room, one of the party, named William
<u>Bloome</u>, rushed into the room, and began to push
about the persons assembled, and disturbed the
evening's amusements, in which he was aided by
his companions. The landlord and some of his
friends made an attempt to thrust them out into
the street. Just as they had reached the door, one
of the party drew a dirk, and stabbed Peter Fitz-
patrick in the groin. He immediately fell. The
same hand next stabbed Peter Delaney, another of
landlord's friends, in the abdomen; he also fell,
and his wound is supposed to be mortal. The next
man stabbed was Edward Denman. He was
wounded over the right ear, but not dangerously.
   The Coroner was called and immediately pro-
ceeded to hold an examination upon Fitzpatrick,
but he died soon after the arrival of the Coroner.
   An inquest was held upon the body, and a ver-
dict of “death from wounds inflicted by some per-
sons unknown” returned by the jury.
   <u>Bloome</u> has since been arrested as the per-
son who stabbed the three individuals above
named. The situation of one of them, Delaney,
is very precarious. Patrick Dase was also cut by
a sharp instrument, but without being aware of it
at the time, supposing that he was struck with a
stick. Although his wound was a severe one, it is
thought he will soon recover.

		<m8>[Reported for the Courier & Enquirer.]</m8>
   <i>Gross Outrage and Singular Developments</i>.—Our rea-
ders will recollect that some months since, a trial was had
at the General Sessions Court of a case of libel, in which
G. W. D. Andrews, and Geo. Craigen, the Editor of the
“Advocate of Moral Reform,” were parties—and that
this libel grew out of the publication of a report of a suit
tried before a Justice's Court at Jersey City, for the re-
covery of certain money alleged as due by Dr. William
Evans, of 100 Chatham street, to a person residing at
Hoboken, for the board of the Doctor and his <i>lady</i>. The
matter of the lady was at the time somewhat shrouded
in mystery, but there is, however, in the present case
which we have to relate, a <i>lady</i> named <i>Anna S. Powell</i>,
who is said to belong to a very respectable family in the
western part of this State, and which <i>lady</i>, were are in-
formed, is now confined in the Lunatic Asylum at Bloom-
ingdale.
   Some eighteen months since, Dr. Evans was called
before the police, to answer to a certain charge in which
Miss Anna S. Powell appeared as the complainant.
   A hearing was had before the Police Justices, and
the result was an order against Dr. Evans for the sup-
port of a <i>bastard child</i>.
   From this decision the Doctor appealed and on his gi-
ving the requisite bail, the cause was carried up to the
sessions court.
   The trial eventually came on in this court, and Miss
Powell, the principal witness on the part of the people,
(or commissioners of the almshouse) failing to appear,
a case was not made out against the accused, and he was
acquitted.
   Subsequently, on instituting the requisite enquiries
the commissioners ascertained that the reason why Miss
Powell did not appear on the occasion of the trial, was,
that she had been inveigled away, or abducted by Dr.
Evans.
   The <s>matter</s> has recently brought to a partial issue, by
<d>[Col.3]</d>
the issue of a warrant by the commissioners, for the ar-
rest of Dr. Evans, on the charge of abducting the wit-
ness, Miss Powell.
   This warrant was put into the hands of Mr. Josiah
Burton, one of the city <u title="marshals">marshalls</u>, who was specially de-
putised by the Sheriff for its execution.
   In pursuance of this duty, Mr. Burton went on Mon-
day afternoon to the office of Doctor Evans, (whom he
did not know,) and enquired if the latter was at home.
   Not receiving a satisfactory reply from several per-
sons who were in attendance at the office, he proceeded
to search the premises, and while thus engaged, he was
assaulted, shamefully beaten, and turned out of the of-
fice by two of the persons present, named George W.
Straight, and —— Goeffrey, or Harvey. Mr. Burton
then went to the police and entered a complaint, and a
warrant was issued for the arrest of the persons above
named, and put into the hands of Officer Place, who went
to the office and found the door fastened, and his admis-
sion and authority otherwise resisted by the threats of
the parties within.
   Mr. Place then returned to the police, and procuring
the aid of several other officers, the whole party re-
turned to the scene of action where, not till the door
was broken open could an entrance be effected.
   The two persons above named were arrested and
taken to the police, and in default of $1000 bail required
they were both committed for trial for the assault.
   Dr. Evans, during the confusion of the moment, <u title="effected">af-
fected</u> his escape, and was not found till yesterday,
when he gave the necessary bail. The other two hope-
ful individuals who so valiantly defended the Doctor's
person and premises, also procured bail, and were lib-
erated from custody; and thus the matter for the pre-
sent rests.

COURT OF OYER AND TERMINER—Yesterday.
   <i>Trial of Ezra White for the murder of Peter Fitzpat-
rick.—Second day</i>.—Lemuel <u title="Stark (elsewhere)">Starke</u>, called and examin-
ed for the prosecution, said—I live at 330 Front street.
I am a caulker—I am 23 or 24 years of age—I know
Ezra White—I have known him about 7 years—I was
in his company on the night of the 13th of February last.
We met in Grand street, on the corner of Willett and
Grand. We met that night as usual. There was no
appointment. We met between 8 and 9 in the evening.
He had a black hat on and crape round it, and a steel
mixed coat, a kind of a gray. It was a coatee. His
pantaloons were black. We went down to Elm street.
We staid there an hour. From thence we went right
up town to a dance. There were three or four others
with us—John Roberts, Peter Rice, and Jimmy Dupee.
We went to Francis Spaight's dance in Elm street. I
and White left the dance in Elm street, and we went
up town to a dance. I don't know the name of the man
who keeps the house. We staid there about three or
four hours. I don't know what hour we left. When
we left I was accompanied by White, Wm. Wright, Bob
Leigh, and my brother Joseph Starke, and three or four
others, whose names I don't remember. I, my brother,
and White went across to Grand street, where we staid
about half an hour. We were all sober except White.
He was a little intoxicated. When we left Grand street,
we went round to Gaffney's house in <u title="Willett">Willet</u> street.
There were three ahead of us, Pierce, my brother, and
Timpson. I and White were about 15 yards behind
them. Those ahead got in, I think, before we did, all
but Pierce. I don't think he went in at all. My brother
and Timpson did. I didn't see them enter the store. I
and White went in as soon as we got to the door in <u title="Willett">Wil-
let</u> street. I went right in and leaned on the counter.
They were quarrelling among themselves when we
went in. Some one down to Frost's said there was a
dance down in <u title="Willett">Willet</u> street. White said we'll go
down there and stay a few minutes, and then we'll go
home. We had no conversation on the way about the
dance. White went in and was going through into the
back room. As he was doing so, three or four catched
hold of him. They never told him to go out, but pulled
him all round. I went up and spoke to the landlord,
and said if you'll get them men off from him I'll get him
out of the house. He made me no answer. I went and
took hold of him, and got him pretty much clear of them
and put him out.
   I was entirely out myself. They caught hold of him
and held him away from me. I got him again, when
two or three rushed out after him again on the walk
and got hold of him. I gave one of them a shove, and
said why don't you let him alone, I want to get him out.
And I said to him come let us go home. White says I
have been ill used a good deal. We went in the house
side by side. I went to the counter and he went to-
wards the back room. I did not hear him say a word,
but when they clinched him, he said let me go. Noth-
ing was said by any body to White; they met him and
caught him by the chest right away. There were about
a dozen persons in the room, pretty much in the middle
of the floor.
They stood so as to obstruct the passage to the back
room. I did not see him run against any one. The
landlord was near the counter on the outside. I don't
recollect that any one said any thing about a muss. We
had to pull very hard to get him (White) away. He
wanted to get away. The reason why White would not
go home with me after I got him out was because he
was intoxicated and felt riled about being choked. I
said, let us go now. He replied he would go in a few
minutes. I pulled him out twice. The first I saw of
the watchman, was when they rushed out on the walk.
Pierce was also on the walk, I do not know where
Timpson was. The door was closed by one, I do not
know by whom. White at this time was right on the
corner. At the time the door was closed, I had hold of
White on the corner. We staid there five or six min-
utes, during which time I had hold of him. I did not
see the door opened at all during this time. We conti-
nued to stand there about five or six minutes. I went
up Broome street, and left White standing right on the
corner. I returned, found the door open and White
standing on the stoop.
   He was rather in Willett street.
   I <u>did'nt</u> see White doing anything; the door was open-
ed that I could see in and persons inside.
   I <u>did'nt</u> see it shut again; nobody said anything to
White, nor he to them.
   The watchman rapped, and I said come let us go; so
we went away.
   White stayed there about a minute, during which I
saw him do nothing; we went up Broome street, and I
went home.
   We went together as far as Walnut street, to White's
brother's, where I staid a few minutes; I then left and
went down to Reader's in Walnut street, where I saw
White; I saw no dirk or sharp instrument that night
nor do I know from anything White said to me that he
had any weapon that night; when I saw him at Read-
er's he had on a fur hat and cape, and a steel mixed
coat, and black pantaloons; I think they were the same
clothes he had on at Gaffney's; I staid at <u>Readers</u> a few
minutes and left White there; I next saw him about 12
o'clock on the morning of the same day at his mother's
at Brooklyn. I slept at home that morning. I went
over to his mother's house—I didn't go in. He came
out into the street in about half an hour after I got there.
I didn't go by any arrangement. White's brother went
over with me. White (the prisoner) had on the same
clothing that I have stated. We crossed the ferry and
went over the battery to a steamboat lying in the East
River, where the Boston boats start from. We went
on board the Boston boat into the cabin. When we left
his mother's house I did not know at all where he was
going. I asked White whether he was going away,
and he said he didn't know whether he was or not.—
Nothing else was said between us. There was no con-
versation between witness and White's brother in the
presence of the prisoner from the time they left his mo-
ther's house until they reached the boat, nor was there
any on board before we left the wharf. Our names were
entered as passengers before the boat left. She left
about four o'clock in the afternoon—my brother went
ashore—I and White, the prisoner, went to Providence,
which place we reached in the morning. White paid his
own passage. I didn't know what names he gave. We
talked about one thing and another. White told me he
was going to Boston. I told him I didn't care where he
went. He said he was going there to get a vessel to go
further. I told him I didn't care, I'd go with him. We
calculated about going to New Orleans if we could get a
<d>[Col.4]</d>
chance. He said we would go if he could get a chance.
The chances are as good at Boston of getting there as
they are here. I told him I did not calculate to stay
more than three or four months. He said he made the
same calculation. When we got to Boston we went to
some house to sleep; a man showed us the place. It
was in an alley, a boarding house. We staid there three
or four nights. During the day we were around Boston.
At the time we arrived we had some conversation about
the affair. I heard before we left the city that Fitzpat-
rick had got killed. He said he had heard the same. I
said I was innocent. I had no knife with me <i>that</i> night.
He said the same. White commenced that conversation.
He told me he did not believe there was any one killed. I
told him I did not know. I had heard there was 3 killed.
I didn't see nothing of it. He had on the clothes he left
this city with, all except the shirt, when he reached Bos-
ton. I had no other clothes than what I stood in. He
had 1 or 2 pair of pantaloons, and 2 or 3 shirts. I can
not say whether he had changed the shirt he had on the
night of the affray. The next day after we arrived in
Boston he tried to procure a ship to go to N. Orleans, but
could not get one. We were arrested on a Monday. I
had his coat on, and he had mine. We changed because
he had an overcoat, and his coat was better then mine.
We had no other reason for the change. I suggested it
to him. I have seen White have a knife. I saw him
with one 3 or 4 months before the affray. The blade
was 3 or 4 inches long, straight, sharp on one side. I
don't know where it is now. I had it in my hand and
threw it on to the ice, and broke the point off.
   Cross-examined by D. Graham, Sen.—The knife was
left square at the point. It was not an uncommon knife.
I have seen workmen have such knives.
   The men at Gaffney's appeared to be all in liquor.
They appeared to be angry, and their hands were a go-
ing, whether they had hold of one another or no, I can't
say. We went there peaceably and with peaceable in-
tentions. I did not see any of my party provoke any of
these men, either by word or action. I did not see
White strike or provoke any one. I did not hear the cry
of murder that night. The watchman did not conduct
himself as if any thing was wrong. Neither White,
<u title="Pierce (elsewhere)">Pearce</u>, or my brother said any thing about any body ha-
ving been wounded all the time we were there. The
noise was going on inside (Gaffney's) when the watch-
man rapped. I heard the next morning that 3 persons
had been stabbed, and knowing I had been there, although
I was satisfied of my innocence, I thought I would go
away. I thought I might be blamed for it.
   White said he was as innocent as I was. I knew of
nothing to compel him to go away, nor did he state to
me any thing to compel him to go. I saw a knife on the
meat bench at Gaffney's. It was a carving knife. This
bench or block stood on the right, near to the door, close
to the wall. I saw the knife lying there when I went in,
and not when I went out. Any of our party had a
chance of taking it up—that is a fact. I didn't see any
of them take it up. The handle of the knife was close
by the edge of the block. I saw no knife of that kind
in the hand of White. If he had had such a knife, I
think it was probable I should have seen it.
   Some questions was here put to the witness, in which
an allusion was made to what the District Attorney had
done in his direct examination.
   The District Attorney rose and objected to this mode
of conducting the case, and was sustained by the court.
   Mr. Graham replied sharply to the court, and said he
had been censured much too often.
   The court directed the case to proceed.
   By Mr. Graham to the witness—Tell us about White
having complained of his throat.
   Witness—Put the question right, and I will answer it
right if I can. I asked White to exchange clothes, to
enable me to appear finer on Sunday. We were arrest-
ed at Boston by officers sent on from this city. White
was examined before the upper police. I was not.—
Justice Palmer told me I must be a witness against Mr.
White, and then I should not be examined at all. Jus-
tice Taylor called me up for examination, and I refused
to answer any questions, in consequence of what Mr.
Palmer had said to me. I was discharged without giv-
ing or being required to enter into bail, except to appear
as a witness.
   James Riley called and examined for the prosecution.
I reside at 60 Willett street. In February I lived at 49.
I am married. I knew Peter Fitzpatrick. I was not at
Gaffney's that night. I didn't belong to the party. I
came by that way. I was coming down the walk, and
Peter Fitzpatrick was standing on the side walk. I saw
him stumble over against the watchman. Then I didn't
know what was the matter with him. I saw the prison-
er go up to him, and he (Fitzpatrick) fell, but what he
did to him I don't know. Fitzpatrick got up again and
waked into the house. The prisoner, when I first saw
him, made a step or two towards the deceased. While
I was standing there, I heard that a man was killed.—
It was said loud enough to be heard outside (Gaffney's.)
   By the Court—How loud was it said?
   Witness—Well, I don't know, I didn't rule it. I went
for a surgeon. I ran all the way. The doctor came
with me immediately. I then went into Gaffney's, and
saw Fitzpatrick. Saw the wound, it was in his groins,
and I staid with him till he died, when I helped to car-
ry him home. When I first saw White and Fitzpatrick
there was no quarreling and no noise. They seemed to
me to be all good humored together. I saw no blood
outside, but some inside (Gaffney's) when I came back.
   Cross-examined—I had been out that night with my
wife. I was returning home. When I left her I be-
lieve it was between one and two o'clock. I had seen
White before that night. I was a little acquainted with
him. I saw another wounded person after I saw Fitz-
patrick. It was Mr. <u title="Denman (elsewhere)">Denny</u>—he had a gash on his head.
He was in the bar room. I did not see any one holding
White. There were some persons near him.
   By the Court—Did Fitzpatrick appear to be in liquor?
   Witness—It is difficult to tell whether dead men have
been in liquor or not. I did not see any thing in White's
hand, nor did I see him put his hand into his pockets.
I did not speak to him. I knew White as soon as I saw
him. I have seen him gambling with others on the
Hook. I looked on. I have seen him gambling two or
three times. It was with thimbles they were doing
something. Money was bet on it.
   By a Juror—Was Fitzpatrick stabbed inside the house
or outside?
   Witness—Outside.
   By <u>W</u>. Graham—How do you know he was stabbed?
   Witness—I don't know, only that I saw him fall.
   At the close of the examination of this witness, the
Court took a recess until four o'clock.
   On the re-assembling of the court, the first witness cal-
led, was
   Wm. B. Timpson.—I am an Engineer by profession.
Know the prisoner. On the night of the affray, was at
Frost's <u title="Refectory">Refrectory</u>, and there heard that there was a
dance at Gaffney's—Joseph Starke, Alfred Pierce, Hen-
ry Haynes and John Pelzer, were with me. It was be-
tween two and 3 o'clock when we went to Gaffney's.—
Saw White there in the affray. Saw some men have
hold of him, shoving him out of doors. Three or four
men had hold of White. Didn't see Lemuel Starke
there. Don't know whether the men who put White
out belonged to Gaffney's party. About half a dozen
men came out. Don't know who was outside when they
put White out. Don't know what became of White af-
ter they put him out. I stood on the walk with the
watchman. Did not see White again afterward.
   Ques. By Whiting.—What did you see further.
   Objected to by Graham as irrelevant.
   Objection overruled by the court.
   Witness continued. The watchman then rapped, and
I went home. I stood there in all about ten minutes.
During the ten minutes while I stood on the walk, I saw
nothing but a scuffle on the walk. Did not attempt to
assist White. They put him out of the Willett street
door. I was standing toward Grand street. White
went toward Broome street. Did not see White go in
again. Did not see any one go in. <u>Did'nt</u> take particu-
lar notice. <u>Did'nt</u> see Fitzpatrick or Gaffney—<u>dont</u>
know either of them. <u>Dont</u> know why the watchman
rapped. Joseph Starke was standing with me. At the
time—think that about half a dozen persons were stand-
ing with me on the walk—Joseph Starke was there—
<u>dont</u> know that Samuel Starke was there. <u>Did'nt</u> hear
that any one was stabbed. <u>Did'nt</u> see any one fall on
the watchman; saw no blows struck; <u>did'nt</u> see White
have any knife that night; <u>did'nt</u> see a meat block in-
side the door. When the watchman rapped went away,
because I <u>did'nt</u> want to get into any scrape. <u>Did'nt</u>
see White afterwards. I worked for Justine Fountain
then. I now work up the river. <u>Did'nt</u> converse with
White at the oyster house. White had on a black coat,
and black hat and pantaloons.
   Alfred Pierce.—I resided 18 Cannon street on the
night of the affray. I saw White at Frost's oyster house
between 1 and 2 o'clock, did not converse with him.
Went with the Starkes, Timpson, <u title="Pelzer (elsewhere)">Pelser</u>, and Hall to
the corner of Willett and Broome. All but myself
went into Gaffney's. While they were in White came
there. Lemuel Starke came with White. They went
in. Soon as White went in two men caught him by the
throat. White had been in about two minutes when the
men took hold of him, heard no dispute between him
and the men. The men were pulling White about and
Starke went in and separated them. Timpson went into
the back room. Didn't see any thing in White's hand.
There was a crowd inside. Don't know how many.
White opened the door several times, and as he opened
the door he made a thrust, each time with his right
hand. Could see the persons inside when the door was
opened. The door was opened and closed three times.
When the watchman rapped saw two other watchmen
come up—they come up from toward Delancey street.
   Dr. Charles Fitzpatrick was called in shortly after
the affray. Saw the body of deceased. Found another
physician had arrived there before me, and did nothing
more than lay my hand on the body, which I found quite
cold. The pulse had entirely ceased. Found a wound
on the right groin. It appeared to have been given by
a sharp instrument. Could not tell whether he had
bled much. He had been washed and was as cold as
ice. The femoral artery had been punctured. I ex-
amined the wound upon <u title="Denman (elsewhere)">Denham</u>, it was upon the right
temple. It appeared to be a clean cut.
   This witness was cross-examined, but nothing new
was elicited.
   Dr. Walter <u title="Payley (elsewhere)">Pugsley</u>—Was called to see Fitzpatrick
after he was stabbed. Found a deep wound on the
right groin, which had penetrated the main artery. The
wound was about three-fourths of an inch wide. I
probed it with my finger, and it about 3 inches deep. He
was much <u title="exhausted">exhaused</u>, and but just alive. The blood had
ceased flowing. Sometimes the blood will cease flow-
ing before the supply is entirely exhausted. Have no
doubt that the wound caused his death. In this case
the <u title="hemorrhage">hemorrage</u> was stopped from the contraction of the
vessels.
   Dr. S. C. Ellis.—Was present at the post mortem ex-
amination on Fitzpatrick's body. Found a wound in the
right groin. The wound ran <u title="transversely">transeversely</u> across the
body. At first view of the external wound, we thought
that some of the internal minor vessels were wounded.
The examination was conducted by Drs. Cadwell, Tap-
pen and myself. The femoral vein we found had been
nearly severed. The vein when distended with blood,
is almost the size of one's little finger. There was
coagulated blood both within and outside the wound.
The severing of this vein does not necessarily produce
death; but would do so if not seasonably attended to.
   From the appearance of the wound the man might
have lived an hour after the infliction of the wound. The
first duty of a surgeon, on finding such a wound, should
be to apply a heavy pressure upon the artery. So long
as the man breathed, if his blood was not entirely ex-
hausted, there is a probability that his life might be sa-
ved. Deceased was a stout man, about 5 feet 6 or 7
inches high. In a case of this kind, so long as there is
life there is a possibility of restoring the person wound-
ed, and we never cease to apply remedies. My first
course would be to apply a pressure to the artery, and
give stimulants.
   William <u title="Hale (elsewhere)">Hales</u>.—Am a painter by trade, and 20 years
of age. On the 13th of February last, I lived at No. 22
Cannon street. I know Ezra White—have been a school
fellow with him. On the night of the affray I was with
him at Frost's, but not at Gaffney's. He left Frost's in
company with Lemuel Starke, a few minutes before I
did. At Gaffney's I saw a great number of people in the
back room. I saw J. Starke, <u>Peltzer</u> and Timpson—
where White was at that time I know not. I was in the
back room some few minutes, and hearing a scuffle in
front, I went out. Saw White, and others trying to put
him out. The landlord said, “young men, I'm astonish-
ed at you.” This he said on the outside of the door,
and saying nothing more he went in and closed the door.
Saw White go to the <u title="Willett">Willet</u> street door, open it, and
strike his hand in. Did not see inside the door. Saw
nothing in his hand. First saw the watchman when he
rapped. White then went up <u title="Willett">Willet</u> street at a very
fast walk. I went up Broome street, but did not see
White. White seemed much excited and mad when he
opened the door. When the men put White out they
came out upon the stoop. They came out again upon
the walk—don't know who opened the door. They came
out toward White, within two feet of him. The land-
lord then came out and put them all in again, and closed
the door—then it was that White opened the door and
made the thrusts. Heard no one call the watch. Did
not see White have a knife. Had not for some years
been much in company with White before this night.
   [Here the testimony is but a repetition of that given
by preceding witnesses.]
   At the conclusion of this witness's testimony the Court
adjourned to 10 o'clock this morning.

   <b>CONVICTION OF WHITE, THE MURDERER.</b>
—<i>Before the Court of Oyer and Terminer, yesterday, Judge
Inglis presiding</i>.—It is rare, very rare, that our citizens
are called upon to witness scenes of such overwhelming
excitement, as have occurred at the City Hall, daily,
during the past week.
   It has been an occasion of peculiar interest to every
lover of good order, and the well being of society. The
“observed of all observers,” the prisoner at the bar, is
a young man, just blooming into manhood, some twenty-
two years of age, of an unusually prepossessing appear-
ance—clad in a most tasteful and elegant apparel, and in
every way calculated, so far as his exterior is concern-
ed, to win the pity and excite the sympathy of the casual
observer.
   Fixing the criminal as the centre of the scene, the
outline, as delineated throughout the trial, is in charac-
ter no less imposing and interesting. On his left hand
sits his brother, apparently of an age co-equal with his
own. On his right, his junior counsel, too apparently
green in years, and next, the associate counsel, the father
of the former, but yet, to all appearance, in the prime of
life, and possessing all the vigor of intellect, with a three
fold store of experience and intelligence.
   Directly in front of the prisoner, and between him and
the bench, sits the prosecuting officer, the advocate of
the People, the representative and defender of their
rights; and in a more elevated position in front, and
above all, sits the stern minister of justice, the presiding
Judge, supported on either hand by a City Magistrate,
of lesser grade and power.
   The back ground, the entire area of the spacious hall,
is filled with a dense crowd of eager and anxious spec-
tators, composed mostly, of what? of a class, we will not
say guilty, but unfortunately, nearly all the associates and
friends of the poor wretch who is about to offer up his
life a sacrifice on the altar of offended justice. But
enough of the scene, we have before described it, and
in no one particular did it vary yesterday, from what
has been presented during the whole trial, excepting
that the crowd was greatly increased in numbers, and
an eagerness, amounting almost to frenzy, prevailed
throughout the day.
   Never, certainly, was a prisoner more ably defended.
Not a stone has been left unturned—not a particle of
testimony, which could by any possibility be perverted
so as to tell in the prisoner's favor, but has been spread
in its most magnified form before the jury. In the dis-
play of ability and legal acumen, for which the junior
counsel, D. Graham, Jr., is so remarkable, he has even
surpassed himself, and the distinguished reputation of
the elder Graham has lost nothing in public estimation
by the extraordinary effort made by him on the present
occasion. Indeed, so completely were the audience
carried away by the force of his argument, and the pow-
er of his eloquence, that at the conclusion of his address
to the jury, the court room resounded with the plaudits
of the assembled multitude, and notwithstanding the
solemnity of the occasion. It was long before the offi-
cers could procure a due observance of order and regu-
larity.
   On the part of the prosecution the case has been con-
ducted by the District Attorney, Mr. Whiting, with an
ability never surpassed, if ever equalled in the history
of the criminal jurisprudence of our city.
   On the opening of the Court yesterday morning at 10
o'clock, his honor Judge Inglis, commenced his charge
to the jury. He <u title="recapitulated">recapulated</u> with the greatest preci-
sion and minuteness, the whole of the testimony in the
case, and as he progressed, cited all the law and autho-
rities, applicable to each particular portion as it had re-
ference to the subject matter at issue. The extraordi-
nary ability displayed by this magistrate, considering his
comparative lack of experience, in the duties incidental
to the elevated station he has been called to occupy, has
excited the astonishment and admiration of all his for-
mer associates at the bar, and drawn from our citizens
generally, a degree of respect, to which he is eminently
entitled.
   His Honor closed his charge to the jury at quarter be-
fore 2 o'clock, when after some few remarks from the
prisoner's counsel, they retired to deliberate upon a
verdict.
   The jury remained absent till 6 o'clock last evening,
when it was announced that they had agreed upon a
verdict. The Court then came in, and at the same mo-
ment the Hall was again filled with spectators.
   The Prisoner was called upon to stand up and look
upon the jury, and as the foreman, amid the death-like
stillness which reigned around, pronounced the awful
words “<i>Guilty of Wilful Murder!</i>” he stood before
them with an unblanched cheek—not a muscle of his
countenance was seen to move, but throughout the
heart-sickening scene, which drew tears from the eyes
of even many of the veteran officers around him, he
maintained during the dreadful moment the same stoical
indifference of feeling he has manifested throughout the
whole trial.
   Those who have attended the trial throughout, and
heard the testimony on either side, cannot but acknow-
ledge that it is “righteous judgment,” and a rendition
of ample justice both to the accused and to the commu-
nity at large.
   An immense crowd were within and about the City
Hall, to witness the removal of the prisoner to the Halls
of Justice; and it was feared at one time from their
movements that an attempt would be made to rescue
White from the hands of the officers. By a skillful ma-
noeuvre of Mr. Sheriff Acker and Deputy Lowndes, the
removal was happily effected without difficulty or dis-
turbance, and even without the knowledge of most of
the people present. The prisoner was taken into a car-
riage from the western basement entrance of the Hall,
and conducted through the Centre street gate to the pri-
son yard, and all effected in safety before the crowd had
time to reach the spot. White will be brought up for
sentence on the last day of the term of the Court, proba-
bly on Wednesday of next week.

   R<small>ESULT OF THE</small> T<small>RIAL OF</small> E<small>ZRA</small> C. W<small>HITE</small>.—
Yesterday morning, at the Court of Oyer and
Terminer, Judge Inglis presiding, the jury were
charged, and afterwards retired to consider their
verdict. At 5 P. M. they returned, having found
the prisoner guilty of <small>WILFUL MURDER</small>.
	...
crowd in the Court room, and about the Hall, was
very great, and some fears were entertained that
a rescue might be attempted. By the judicious ar-
rangements of Mr. Acker, the Sheriff, the prisoner
was removed without any difficulty or disturbance,
and was immediately taken to the Centre street
prison, whence he will be brought to receive his
sentence probably on Wednesday next.

   T<small>RIAL FOR</small> M<small>URDER</small>.—The following brief
analysis of the trial of Ezra White, for the murder
of Peter Fitzpatrick, which occupied the Court of
Oyer and Terminer from the 10th to the 16th in-
stant, and caused great excitement, is from the
Journal of Commerce.
   “On the night of the 13th of February last, a
man named Lawrence Gaffney, who had recently
commenced keeping a public house in Broome
street, invited some friends to a house-warming.
About 3 o'clock in the morning, while his company
were dancing and amusing themselves, the prison-
er and three other young men went into the house
uninvited, and two of them walked into a back
room, where the greater part of Gaffney's friends
were. The prisoner had scarcely entered the
house when one of Gaffney's friends suggested to
the prisoner and his friends that they were in-
truding, and the prisoner replied, “I came here
to make a muss, and I'll go when I d——n please.”
   Gaffney, who was then standing behind his coun-
ter, feared an affray would take place between the
parties, and came from behind the counter with
the intention of interposing between them. Al-
most at the same moment the prisoner made a
push at one of Gaffney's party, named McLany,
and the latter pushed at him. Gaffney then rush-
ed between them, and seized hold of the prisoner,
and pushed him out of the house, and some per-
son outside, supposed to be a watchman, closed the
door, which opened into the street. The prisoner
immediately pushed the door partly open again,
and thrust in his hand with a knife in it, as if in
the act of stabbing at some person. The door
was again closed by a person inside, and again
partly pushed open by the prisoner, who repeated
the same <u title="manoeuvre">manœuvre</u> with his hand. In a moment
or two after, the door was opened by some
person inside, and one of Gaffney's party, named
Fitzpatrick, stepped out on the stoop, and was in-
stantly stabbed by the prisoner, in the groin, and
fell to the ground mortally wounded, and died
shortly after. The prisoner and his companions
then ran away; and the ensuing day, the prisoner
and one of his companions of the night before, fled
from this city in the steamboat to Boston, from
whence they intended to go to Charleston, but
were pursued by the police, and arrested at Bos-
ton, and brought back to New York.
   There was a good deal of contradictory evi-
dence as to the description of clothes worn by the
prisoner on the night of the murder, and as to
whether he had or had not been roughly treated
by some of Gaffney's friends, not including Fitzpa-
trick, before he was put out of the house. But
the evidence showed most indisputably that the
prisoner had killed the deceased, in the manner
we have described, and the only question which
admitted of any doubt, was, as to what was the
legal degree of crime which the homicide amount-
ed to.
   Judge Inglis, in a charge of more than three
hours length, minutely summed up the evidence,
and with great perspicuity pointed out the different
circumstances which rendered homicide murder or
manslaughter in its different degrees.
   Counsel for the prisoner took several exceptions
to his honor's charge.
   The jury retired, and after an absence of near-
ly four hours, brought in a verdict of “wilful mur-
der.”

   <i>Death from Oil of <u title="Tansy">Tanzy</u>.—Caution to Females</i>.—On
Sunday afternoon a colored female, named Tuttle, aged
23, a servant in the family of John Sevens of 117 Wal-
ker street, procured an ounce of oil of <u title="tansy">tanzy</u>, which she
attempted to administer to herself, for the purpose of
producing abortion. About 12 o'clock she retired to
her room and took nearly one half of the contents of the
phial. She was immediately thrown into the most dread-
ful paroxysms, and though medical aid was called in,
and every remedy adopted for her relief, she survived
less than one hour. The coroner's jury, which was
called yesterday to view the body, rendered a verdict
in accordance with the above facts.

	SUPREME COURT OF NEW YORK.
		(Sitting at Albany.)
   Ezra White, <i>ads.</i> The People, &c.—The defendant in
this case was convicted of the murder of Peter Fitzpat-
rick, in the Court of Oyer and Terminer in this city in
June last. He was last week removed to Albany, to be
heard by counsel, on a motion for a new trial. The bill
of exceptions set forth that the convictions were illegal.
1st, that the Judge (Inglis) who presided at the trial was
not empowered by the statute to preside in courts of
criminal jurisprudence, and 2d, that the indictment un-
der which the defendant was tried, was defective in ha-
ving therein but one count and not setting forth distinc-
tively the allegations as required by the statute.
   The case was eloquently and ably argued, and at
great length, by Messrs. D. Graham, of this city, and S.
Stephens, of Albany; and for the prosecution, by J. R.
Whitney, Esq., District Attorney.
   The court, on Thursday morning, delivered a long
opinion, confirming the Judgement of the Court of Oyer
and Terminer.
   The prisoner, in custody of the keeper, Mr. Hyde,
and officer Staunton, returned to the city yesterday, and
was committed to the city prison, where he now awaits
the sentence of death.
   Mr. Stephens gave notice to the Court that an appeal
would be made to the Court of Errors for a reversion
of the decision.

   <i>Sentence of White</i>.—In the Court of Oyer and Termi-
ner, on Saturday, Judge Inglis <s>p??????????????</s> to
previous appointment, Ezra White <s>convicted</s> of the
murder of Peter Fitzpatrick, was put to the bar for sen-
tence. The prisoner throughout preserved the most
stoical indifference to the thrilling scene which was pass-
ing around him, and at times, when almost every indivi-
dual of the assembled crowd was moved to tears, the
prisoner retained the same fixedness of countenance,
and to all appearances was, of all present, the least af-
fected.
   On being asked if he had any thing to say why judg-
ment should not be pronounced upon him, he simply re-
plied, “I will leave all that to my counsel.”
   David Graham, Esq. said that he had nothing to in-
terpose in the way of Sentence of <i>Death</i> being pro-
nounced, but that he was prepared with a Bill of Ex-
ceptions, on which to carry the case up to the Court of
Errors, which he wished to have put upon the files of
the Court.
   His Honor, previous to pronouncing the awful sen-
tence of the law, addressed with much feeling the
wretched culprit. He recapitulated with great minute-
ness all the circumstances which took place on the night
of the murder. On the trial, which was an unusually
protracted one, the prisoner, he said, had enjoyed every
possible advantage of proving himself innocent. His
counsel, the most able and zealous that could have been
selected, have argued to the jury every argument which
their learning could draw from the law, or their inge-
nuity could extort from the facts of the case. The Jury,
after a most patient investigation, and after having been
kept together a much longer time then they themselves
deemed necessary, without a voice of dissent, agreed up-
on a verdict of <i>Guilty</i>, which verdict was clearly a just
and righteous one, and one in which the whole public
would finally concur. His Honor alluded to the apparent
immobility of the prisoner, (which he preserved through-
out the trying scene) and remarked that was perhaps
less necessary for the <u title="prisoner's">prisoners</u> sake than for that of
his companions about him, that he should allude to the
awful doom which awaited the transgressor of the law.
He informed the prisoner, that though application would
be made in his behalf to a higher tribunal, yet from this
source he could have but little to hope. As a last re-
sort, an appeal might be made for clemency of the Ex-
ecutive; but he would put it to the prisoner himself, if
the circumstances of the case would entitle him to the
merit of a pardon from the Governor. There was then
in all human probability, for him no hope, and he would
therefore commend him to self reflection, and to sue for
pardon to that Tribunal before which he must shortly ap-
pear. His honor then pronounced the sentence, that the
prisoner be taken to the prison from which he came,
and thence, on the 16th of January next, be taken to the
place of execution, and there to be hanged by the neck
till he was <i>dead</i>.
   The prisoner was then remanded, and the court ad-
journed.

   <i>Sudden Death</i>.—The Coroner called yesterday, to
hold an inquest at 208 Elizabeth street, on the body of
John <u title="Dwyer (in American)">Duryea</u>, a native of Tipperary, Ireland, <u title="43 (in American)">48</u> years
of age. It appeared that deceased was a pill maker, in
the employ of Dr. Evans, of Chatham street. He lived
in the upper part of a house occupied by Michael Mc
Dermot. He had been complaining more or less for a
month past—during which time he has done no work.—
On Monday evening he came down into McDermot's
shop, and sat by the stove till 10 o'clock, when he went
up stairs to go to his room, and when on reaching the
landing he fell down, and almost instantly expired. In
his pocket was found a certificate of membership, of
Lodge No. 1404 of Royal Orange Association, dated
October 1823. He had several children living but no
wife. Verdict death by visitation of God.

   C<small>ORONER'S</small> O<small>FFICE</small>—S<small>UDDEN</small> D<small>EATH</small>.—Mr. John
<u title="Duryea (in Courier)">Dwyer</u>, a native of Ireland, aged <u title="48 (in Courier)">43</u> years, died
very suddenly yesterday, at No. 208 Elizabeth
street. From the testimony of Mrs. Dermot, with
whom he boarded, it appears the deceased had been
sick some time. He had been in the employ of
Dr. Evans, of Chatham street. On Monday even-
ing he said, “I am going to bed,” and went up
stairs for that purpose. He was soon after heard
to fall.
   Mrs. Smith deposed that she heard the deceased
fall down stairs. She took a light and went to him.
He was lying at the bottom of the stairs. He said,
“I am going to die, pray put me to bed.” The
deceased was put to bed. His clothes were taken
off. He did not live five minutes afterwards. The
jury returned a verdict of “Death from the visita-
tion of God.”—[Gazette.]

<h2>Ezra White—Ruffians Emboldened</h2>

   The death of Armstrong, the rioter, on New
Year's eve, and his reputed connection with the
gang of which <i>Ezra White</i>, now lying under sen-
tence of death for murder, was connected, has led
to some inquiry into the circumstances under which
this latter was recently reprieved by the Governor
until the Court for the Correction of Errors shall
determine upon the validity of exceptions taken in
his behalf.
   We believe these facts are as follows: The
Court of <i>Oyer and Terminer</i>, at which White was
tried, was held by Judge Edwards and his associate
Judge Inglis. Early in the trial Judge Edwards,
for good cause, left the bench, and the proceedings
was carried on and closed before Judge Inglis, by
whom sentence of death was pronounced upon
White. The counsel for the convict have except-
ed to the legality of the trial and condemnation,
on the ground that, by the statute, none but a Cir-
cuit Judge, or <i>first</i> Judge of the County, can hold
the <i>Oyer and Terminer</i>; and although subsequent
legislation has given both to the Circuit Judge and
to the First Judge an assistant, and to these as-
sistants, as is believed, equal power with the prin-
cipals; yet, inasmuch as counsel learned in the
law contend that this is a doubtful construction, and
that if no such equality of power be given, then the
trial before Judge Inglis is null—it seemed incum-
bent on the Governor, in a matter of life and death,
to afford the convict the opportunity of carrying
the exception up to the higher courts.
   We understand that the Supreme Court have
affirmed the validity of the trial. A farther ap-
peal has been taken to the Court of Errors. If
they shall confirm the decision below, the law
will take its course, and the convict be executed.
If they should reverse it, the result will be—not
the liberation or pardon of the murdered—but a
new trial, before a competent Court.
   We have been thus particular, because it is, we
think, no part of the character of Governor Seward,
to interpose the prerogative of pardon between the
law and guilt so clear as that established on the
trial against White; and because the recent out-
rages of the same lawless ruffians with whom he
was an associate, would seem to show that the
hope of the possible eventual escape of their old
comrade after condemnation, has rather embolden-
ed, than restrained, their excesses.
   Thus far the sole action in this matter of the
Executive has been to afford time for the solution
of a legal doubt, which touches in no degree the
guilt or innocence of he accused, and furnishes no
ground, in any event, for eventual pardon.

<m9><cl>T</cl>O THE LADIES—It will be remembered that it is
about four years since Dr. Vandenburgh's Female
Renovating Pills, which have acquired a well deserved
celebrity for their excellent effects, were first introduced
into this country by Mrs. Bird, the celebrated midwife
and female physician; since that, however, several at-
tempts have been made to imitate this medicine; the
consequences of which, are misery and suffering to the
misguided individuals who are deceived by these un-
principled pretenders who are daily palming their spu-
rious specifics upon the community. Mrs. Bird would
remark that many cases have come to her notice where
the constitution of the patient has been materially in-
jured. Mrs. B. apprises females that she has received
a thorough medical education—has obtained her diplo-
ma from the medical college, Gottingen, Germany; and
her long experience in the treatment of all female com-
plaints well qualifies her for the task of imparting health,
vigor, and consequently happiness, to all those who may
honor her with their confidence. Residence of Mrs.
Bird, 18 Oliver st., where she is prepared to accommo-
date ladies on the point of confinement, and to adminis-
ter medicines for all diseases to which her sex is liable.

<m9>   CAUTION—SPURIOUS FEMALE MONTHLY
PILLS—Owing to the great celebrity, efficacy, and suc-
cess of Madame Restell's Female Monthly Pills, in all
cases of irregularity, suppression, &c, &c, and their ac-
knowledged adaptation to the complaints of the female
frame, attempts are continually made by ignorant and
unprincipled persons, by calling their miserable com-
pounds “Female Monthly Pills,” to impose upon the
public. Madame Restell deems it necessary to state that
her genuine “Female Monthly Pills,” can be obtained
only at her offices in New York, Philadelphia and Boston,
and agents mentioned in her advertisement on the last
column of the last page. All others are base imitations.
Madame Restell's celebrated “Powders,” for married la-
dies in delicate health, can be obtained only at her offices
No 3 South Seventh st., Philadelphia; 7 Essex st., Boston,
and Madame Restell's Principal Office, 148 Greenwich

<m9>   ☞ TO FEMALES—BEWARE OF IMPOSITION
—Since the introduction of Madame Restell's Celebrated
Female Monthly Pills into the United States, some two
years since, such has been their success in all cases of
suppression, irregularity, stoppage, &c, that they have
altogether superseded the various useless and injurious
compounds, thrust upon the public by designing pretend-
ers, who, finding their miserable and injurious com-
pounds unsaleable as “Female Renovating Pills,” im-
pudently seek to deceive the public by calling them “Fe-
male Monthly Pills,” and under cover of the high repute
of Madame Restell's Female Monthly Pills, imagine to
find sale for their deleterious compositions. This con-
temptible trick has not even the merit of originality.—
Some four or five previous attempts of this kind, to de-
ceive the public, have been already made by unprinci-
pled individuals, to gain a few dollars, causing not only
a loss of money, but sacrifice of health to the unwary.
Madame Restell feels herself under the more obligation
to caution females against these attempts at imposition,
as besides the loss of their money, highly detrimental
effects for life ensue. That imposters should have been
anxious, from time to time, to avail themselves of the
celebrity attained by Madame Restell's Female Monthly
<u>Pill</u>, is not a matter of surprise, since such is their repu-
tation, that she has been under the necessity of opening
offices in Boston, No. 7 Essex st., Philadelphia, No. 3
South Seventh st., as well as the principal office, 148
Greenwich st., New York, besides appointing agents for
their sale in this city, as mentioned in Madame Restell's
advertisements. All Female Monthly Pills, except those
sold at Madame Restell's offices, or her advertised
agents, are bare and miserable imitations. Females
will judge of the shallow pretensions of the individual
who is under the necessity of making use of the celebrity
acquired by others to be brought into notice.<!-- Some text is better seen in file 0280. -->

<m9>LEGAL INJUSTICE! EFFECTS OF <u title="PERSECUTION">PERECU-</u>

   MADAME RESTELL'S promise to give the facts
connected with the prosecution—it may with justice be
called persecution—commenced some sixteen months
since, and has just terminated—against her—with such re-
marks as have suggested themselves, is presented to the

which it may also be learned how much injustice can be
perpetrated under the sanction of legal, doubtless perfect-

   The facts are simply these: In July, 1839, a female
having heard of the great reputation and success of Ma-
dame Restell's specifics for suppression, irregularity, &c.
finding herself irregular, called to obtain a box of “Fe-
male Monthly Pills” at the office; being a foreigner it
was difficult for her to made herself intelligible, but
she was understood to say that she was subject to irreg-
ularity, &c. In the course of conversation she was
informed that if she was married, she must not under
peculiar circumstances, mentioned in the directions,
make use of them. She purchased a box and took it
home. In the latter end of August, it appears, she en-
tered a complaint against a young man—in the course
of her examination, she stated that she purchased a box
of pills, but declared under oath “that she had never
used a single one.” In February, 1840, she went to the
Bellevue Hospital, and was there delivered of two living
children, where she expired on the following March, of
child-bed, or puerperal fever. Here, then, are the facts
which have led to the prosecution and subsequent honor-
able discharge, without trial, of Madame Restell. Such
was the material upon which a prosecution was com-
menced. The flimsiness and injustice of the prosecution
covered the instigators with ridicule and shame, and re-
sulted, after a procrastination of sixteen months, as
every person of the least common sense would have pre-
dicted, in a “nolle prosequi” being entered.
   The instigators and chief actors in the prosecution
may or may not have been influenced by upright, honor-
able, or praiseworthy motives; it is not for Madame
Restell to judge of the purity of their intention. They
may honestly imagine that the introduction of Madame
Restell's medicines may lead to immorality, vice, &c.,
but admitting all this, it is scarcely sufficient to justify
them in acts of gross injustice, oppression, and persecu-
tion, under cover of technicalities; but when it is con-
sidered what a frightful train of diseases have their ori-
gin in irregularity, suppression, &c., and the many weak-
ly married women whose lives were despaired of have
become healthy by the adoption of Madame Restell's
celebrated Powders, is not the discovery of Madame
Restell's specifics one of the greatest blessings? and is it
not in the highest degree unjust to intimate that wives,
sisters, and mothers want but the opportunity to be vi-
cious. Shame on him who can entertain such a state-
ment.
   Strange it is, that the lessons of experience should be
lost upon men. When has persecution retarded the pro-
gress of a truth in religion, science or morals? Never.—
It always has, and always will but accelerate with ten-
fold velocity, the advance of the object of persecution,
which, without it, would have only crawled with snail-
like pace, aided by persecution, is immediately possessed
of the impulse of electricity. Thus has it been with Ma-
dame Restell's celebrated medicines—the celebrity they
had for many years enjoyed in Europe, was gradually
gaining ground in the United States, and it would have
taken years to have given them the reputation and celeb-
rity which a few months sufficed by the agency of perse-
cution. They are now known and appreciated far and
wide throughout this country, to the exclusion almost of
all others. So much for persecution. MADAME RES-

<m9><cl>M</cl>ADAME RESTELL'S FEMALE MONTHLY PILLS
 —Madame Restell, Female Physician, has had ample evi-
dence to satisfy her that many of the complaints to which fe-
males are subject, have been principally, if not wholly, owing
to the absence, heretofore, of any proper, safe, efficient, and
certain medicine in cases of suppression, irregularity and stop-
page of those functions of nature upon which the health, and
even the life of every female depends. Delicacy and propriety
forbidding the freedom of unreservedness, except to one of their
own sex, as to the particular effects experienced, without a
knowledge of which it is wholly impossible to form a combi-
nation of ingredients affording relief, as well as the repugnance
of adverting to the subject unless to a female, has, no doubt,
been the chief cause of the want of success of the various
specifics introduced by the medical fraternity. The introduc-
tion of the Female Monthly Pills has removed the source of a
truly frightful mount of misery, as being the only efficacious
remedy known in Europe for the last thirty years, having been
used and first introduced by Madame Restell, the celebrated
Midwife and Female Physician, (grandmother of the adverti-
ser,) with the most unexampled success. Madame Restell, as
well from her perfect acquaintance with the peculiar physiolo-
gy and anatomy of the female frame, as the opportunities af-
forded her in discovering every, the minutest sensation and ef-
fect produced by the use of her Female Monthly Pills has been
enabled so to combine the ingredients of which they are com-
posed, as at once to unite mildness and safety with almost cer-
tain efficacy. The advantages afforded of consulting freely
and unreservedly (without cost) with one of their own sex,
conversant with their dispositions, will be manifest to every
reflecting female, and will save much useless expenditure. It
is to be hoped that the mothers of females just emerging into
womanhood, as they value the future welfare and happiness of
their daughters, or their own peace, will snatch them from the
herd of evils arising from this cause. The most obstinate and
long-seated cases of irregularity, suppression, &c., have been
removed by the female Monthly Pills.
   It is necessary for the married to abstain from their use for
reasons that are contained in the full and particular directions
when and how to be used, which accompany each box.
   Madame Restell's proper signature is written on the cover of
each box. Price $1. For sale at

<m9><cl>I</cl>MPORTANT TO MARRIED FEMALES.—MADAME
 RESTELL'S PREVENTIVE POWDERS.—These in-
valuable Powders have been universally adopted in Europe,
but France in particular, for upwards of thirty years, as well
as by thousands in this country, as being the only mild, safe,
and efficacious remedy for married ladies whose health forbids
a too rapid increase of family.
   Madame Restell, as is well known, was for thirty years Fe-
male Physician in the two principal Female Hospitals in Eu-
rope—those of Vienna and Paris—where, favored by her great
experience and opportunities, she attained that celebrity in
those great discoveries in medical science so specially adapted
to the female frame, for which her medicines now stand unri-
valled, as well in this country as in Europe. Her acquaintance
with the physiology and anatomy of the female frame, enabled
her to arrive at a knowledge of the primary causes of female
indispositions—especially of married females—which, in 1808,
led to the discovery of her celebrated “Preventive Powders.”
Their adoption has been the means of preserving not only the
health, but even the life of many an affectionate wife and fond
mother.
   The advertiser feeling the importance of this subject, and es-
timating the vast benefits resulting to thousands by their adop-
tion, would respectfully arouse the attention of the married, by
all that they hold near and dear, to its consideration. Is it not
wise and virtuous to prevent evils to which we are subject, by
simple and healthy means within our control? Every dispas-
sionate, virtuous, and enlightened mind will unhesitatingly an-
swer in the affirmative. This is all that Madame Restell re-
commends or ever recommended. Price Five Dollars a pack-
age, accompanied with full and particular directions. They

			<b>City Intelligence.</b>
   A D<small>OMESTIC</small> T<small>RAGEDY</small>—M<small>URDER MOST FOUL SUS-
PECTED</small>.—Some months since, there resided and kept
a dry goods store in Greenwich, near Vesey street, a
merchant of the name of William <u title="Morrill (below)">Murrell</u>, who was
in very flourishing circumstances, with good pros-
pects before him, and blessed—as he thought—with
a young and lovely wife, who had one daughter. This
gentleman became smitten with the mania for mak-
ing a fortune rapidly, and sold out his dry goods
store, for the purpose of pursuing other plans for the
furtherance of his wishes at the south. He left his
wife and daughter here, with a large proportion of
his property, intending to return to, or send for them
at his convenience. After his departure, the lady
formed other plans of her own, which greatly alarm-
ed the family of her husband, and in particular was she
cautioned by them against the keeping company with
and promenading Broadway, along with some tall,
dark cavalier, whose name none of her husband's
family was acquainted with. The lady, however,
had a liking for her constant visiter, and determined
not to be thwarted. About three weeks since, an
universal bustle was observed in her department, and
great preparations for packing up, and the following
day several cart loads of valuable moveables were
shipped by her directions, on board one of the pack-
ets that made between this city and the port of Bal-
timore. In the same vessel also embarked the lady,
the tall cavalier, and Mr. <u>Murrell</u>'s daughter.
   Information of these interesting matters was im-
mediately forwared to Mr. <u>Murrell</u> by letter, and he
lost no time ere he bent his steps towards Baltimore,
there to await the arrival of the vessel, taking the
precaution to put on a pair of green spectacles, so as
to be sure he had got hold of the right party before
his faithless wife could have time to give her para-
mour the alarm. When the packet arrived in Balti-
more, Mr. <u>Murrell</u> notified the Captain of the state
of affairs, and cautioned him against giving up any
of the property which had been brought on board
by Mrs. <u>Murrell</u>. He then procured a police officer,
and had that lady's tall and gallant protector taken
into custody, on charge of stealing. These prompt
proceedings alarmed Mrs. <u>Murrell</u>, and she in-
duced her husband to consent to return with her
to this city, and leave her friend to the mercy of the
law. It is supposed that he consented to some such
arrangement, for a letter was received by his friend in
New York announcing their return, and directing
that some furnished apartments should be imme-
diately got for their reception. The appointed day
passed, and the next, but last week the lady and her
daughter returned with the corpse of the late Mr.
<u>Murrell</u>, which she said she had brought here at his
earnest request, in order that it might be buried in the
vault of his family at Port Richmond, Staten Island.
On Wednesday the funeral was to take place, but
when they came to the grave the body had no certifi-
cate from a medical man, which the law requires;
and as the sexton refused to receive the body without
the coroner of that county was sent for. The lady
then represented that the body had been many days
travelling, and that decomposition must have com-
menced, which fact might make it very unpleasant to
have in examination. However it was the general
wish, and the coffin was opened, when the body of
the dead man appeared quite fresh, and appeared to
be only discolored in two places, under the ear and
around the stomach. The coroner not deeming the
circumstances to be suspicious, permitted the fune-
ral ceremony to be performed, and the earth closed,
as it was supposed for ever, over the coffin.
   That night the lady and her daughter staid with the
family of her husband at Staten Island, and of course
the sudden bereavement of the disconsolate widow
was the principal topic of conversation. Mrs. <u>Mur-
rell</u> told different stories of her late husband's last mo-
ments to different people, and one of the relations of the
deceased elicited from the daughter that her mother
had <i>poisoned her father</i>, and was going to return to Bal-
timore to marry the other gentleman. This man went
again to the Coroner, and the body was exhumed, the
stomach, duodenum and other intestines taken out and
brought to this city on Saturday, and delivered to Dr.
Chilton, the eminent chemist, of Broadway, for analy-
zation. The investigation has not yet commenced
and therefore, we cannot give the result at present, but
we understand that there are many circumstances be-
sides the confession of the girl, which seem to
strengthen the suspicion of poisoning. A final inves-
tigation will be held in a day or two, and we shall give
the proceedings thereof; but the strangest part of the
affair is the fact, that the lady and the child have
been permitted to return to Baltimore.

<b>☞</b> BRAZEN ATTEMPT AT IMPOSITION. <b class="r180" title="☜">☞</b></f12>
		<i>CAUTION TO MARRIED LADIES,
	AND TO THOSE ABOUT TO BE MARRIED.</i>
<m9><cl>A</cl>S attempts are made by desperate mercenary, and unprinci-
pled persons to practice a base imposition upon married
ladies and those about to be married, Madame Restell feels
called upon to expose the infamous means by which it is attempt-
ed to be consummated. Some three years since, it may be well
known to all, Madame Restell's celebrated “Preventive Pow-
ders,” (for married ladies, whose delicate or precarious state of
health being such as to forbid a too rapid increase of family,)
were first introduced into this country, and elicited some stric-
tures from the press, as to the propriety and moral tendency of
their introduction. Their perfect safety, efficacy, healthiness,
and certainty, however, having been the means of preserving
the life of many an affectionate wife, unable, or for a time in-
capable, of giving birth to children, was a consideration of pa-
ramount importance, worthy the attention of those who urged
objections.
   Their utmost universal adoption for thirty years in France,
and for three years in the United States, excited the attention
and inquiry of medical men, who, though slow and cautions at
first to credit the possibility of the existence, much less to re-
commend the adoption of a “Preventive to Conception,” could
not, however, resist the conviction that forced itself upon their
minds, from the fact, observable particularly in France (since
the introduction of Madame Restell's celebrated “Preventive
Powders”) of intervals of four or five years between the birth of
children, became convicted that it is the only mild, safe, and <u title="efficacious">ef-
ficatious</u> and certain remedy, and have, with the honorable
promptness, characteristic of the profession, when once satis-
fied of its <u title="beneficial">benificial</u> effects, unhesitatingly recommended their
adoption.
   Madame Restell, as is well known, was for thirty years Fe-
male Physician in the two principal Female Hospitals of Europe
—those of Vienna and Paris—where, favored by her great ex-
perience and opportunities, she attained that celebrity in those
great discoveries in medical science so specially adapted to the
female frame, for which her medicines now stand unrivalled, as
well in this country as in Europe. Her acquaintance with the
physiology and anatomy of the female frame, enabled her to ar-
rive at a knowledge of the primary causes of female indisposi-
tions—especially of married females—which, in 1808, led to the
discovery of her celebrated “Preventive Powders.”
   Their discovery, introduction, and adoption, are fraught with
such lasting and serious consequences to the welfare, the peace,
the health, the well being of husband, wife, mother, and child-
ren, that the advertiser would be recreant to the duties of huma-
nity, if she did not avail herself of the first opportunity, to ex-
pose, in the most explicit manner, the artifices, schemes, and
plans concocted to trifle and perhaps destroy the dearest interests
of the married or those about to be married, by the designing, to
rob them not only of their money but of their happiness, by
getting up counterfeit and imitation “Preventive to Conception,”
highly destructive to the constitution.
   The following has heretofore been, and is now the method by
which some ignorant and luckless quack hopes to dupe the public:
He first hires some woman, who immediately, as if by magic,
becomes “<i>Madame</i>,” and of course, “<i>Graduate as Midwife and
Female Physician from Paris</i>,” (it is thought that through this
means the deception can be better accomplished;) the next step
is to adopt the <i>headings</i>, and as near as possible, the <i>language</i> of
Madame Restell's advertisements; then to adopt for their dele-
terious compounds, the <i>names</i> of Madame Restell's remedies;
and, in short, to imitate Madame Restell in all her medicines.—
Thus, if Madame Restell has “Preventive Powders,” “Female
Monthly Pills,” &c. they must have something with the same
name. These ignorant pretenders also attempt to confine ladies
during confinement, &c. &c.
   By such shallow and catchpenny expedients do they imagine
the public are to be duped. If their nostrums were merely
harmless they might be passed unnoticed; but when such dele-
terious consequences must inevitably ensue to those who may
fall victims to the cupidity of these imposters, whether in taking
their nostrums, or entrusting themselves during confinement in
the hands of incompetent and mercenary adventurers, Madame
Restell deems herself called upon to warn females against these
attempts to deprive them of both their means and health. In
conclusion it is only necessary to say that there are some three
thousand letters in the possession of Madame Restell in proof
of the efficacy, safety, certainty and healthiness of her celebra-
ted “Preventive Powders,” from all parts of the United States
as well as Europe.

<cl>T</cl>O MARRIED LADIES AND THOSE ABOUT TO
BE MARRIED.—MADAME COSTELLO</f12>, Female
Physician and graduate as Midwife, by the Medical Faculty of
Paris, offers her professional services to the Ladies of this city
and country. The anatomical and physiological peculiarities
which distinguish the female from the male, impose upon her
diseases and functions altogether her own. Many of those dis-
eases are exceedingly complicated and obscure, requiring an ac-
curate knowledge of the female system to treat them with suc-
cess. It is a well known fact, that the health of many married
Ladies will not admit of their bearing children without imminent
risk of their lives; it is also well known that many married wo-
men are incapacitated for the important office of child bearing,
by some physical deformities or malformation, whereby the
life of the mother and offspring must both be sacrificed. When
things are left to take their natural course, is it not justifiable,
nay, an imperative duty we owe suffering humanity, to give re-
lief in such cases, especially if we possess the knowledge of safe
means or remedies whereby this desirable object can be effected.
Madame Costello's celebrated “Preventive to Conception,” is a
safe, healthy and effectual means—the limiting the number of
children at will. Madame Costello's “Preventive to Concep-
tion” is the only genuine and effectual one ever introduced into
this country.

   <i>Robbing and Arrest</i>—Mr. George Burtis, merchant,
of Water street, having for some time previous to
October last, missed from his store large quantities of
coffee, recently set himself to work to discover the
thief. The officers of police yesterday found a large
quantity of the coffee in possession of an <u title="Junk (Courier-1841-02-05)">Irish</u> shop-
keeper, corner of Water and Dover street, named
James Ritchie, who was arrested, and confessed that
the coffee was purchased of three negroes, named
“Big George,” Charles Beriley and Samuel Brown—
all of whom were arrested and committed. Mr. Bur-
tis estimates his loss at some 250 bags of coffee.

   A R<small>EMARKABLE</small> C<small>OINCIDENCE</small>.—On Monday mor-
ning, Joseph Brown, Esq. of the Atlantic Hotel, was
charged at the Police Office with insulting wife
of Charles Lohman, a book binder, who resided at
148 Greenwich street. When the lady and gentleman
appeared before the magistrate to make their charge
against Mr. Brown, the lady was asked if she was
not Madame Restell, to which she replied in the ne-
gative. The charge against Brown was dismissed,
and then he turned round and swore that Charles
Lohman had robbed him of a diamond breast pin to
the value of $<u>100</u>.
   On this complaint Master Lohman was brought
up and submitted to an examination, by order of
Justice Stevens. Lohman, on this, said that Brown
came to his house in Greenwich street, and was
turned out for improper behaviour to the ladies, in
which turning out, he might have lost his breast pin.
This story was very feasible, and therefore the ma-
gistrate held Charles Lohman to bail—but <i>only</i> in
the sum of $100. Robert <u>Famaris</u>, tailor, of Fulton
street, thereupon came, and gave bail for the ac-
cused—who of course was liberated. The coinci-
dence in the case is this, that on the 17th of August,
1839, one Charles Lohman, and Dr. Evans, appeared
and testified as bail in the case of Caroline Restell.
Yet the present Charles Lohman, and his lady say
they are not the same persons, although residing at
148 Greenwich street.

	UNITED STATES CIRCUIT COURT.
		Before Justice Kirtland.
   <i>Charge of Robbery</i>.—On Saturday night, a man
named Joseph Brown, was taken into custody by a
watchman, on charge of disorderly conduct, at the
house of the notorious <u>Madam</u> Restell, 148 Green-
wich street, Brown was subsequently liberated from
custody, yesterday. Mr. Brown came to the Police,
and preferred a complaint against a man named
Charles Lohman, charging him with having stolen
from him, (Brown) on Saturday night last, a diamond
beastpin, value $<u>50</u>.
   Lohman, (who is the same individual who, on the
17th of August, 1839, became joint bail in $1,500 for
Madame Restell,) on his examination, stated that he
resided at 148 Greenwich street; was 32 years of age,
born in Russia, and a book-binder; that on the Sa-
turday night in question, Brown <i>insulted</i> his wife,
that he attempted to put him out of doors, but being
unable to do so, called to his aid a watchman. He
denied having stolen the pin, but presumed that it
might have been lost in the scuffle. Lohman was
required to give sureties in $100, and Mr. Robert
<u>Farmariss</u>, of 154 William street, becoming his bail
in that amount, he was liberated.

   <i>Junk Shops</i>.—In a report of a case of “<u title="Robbing in Courier-1841-02-03">Robbery</u>
and Arrest,” published in our <u title="Wednesday's">Tuesdays</u> paper, our re-
porter was made by the printers to say, that the sto-
len property was found in possession of an “<i>Irish</i>
shop-keeper.” The report should have read “<i>Junk</i>
shop-keeper,” when it would have been “all right.”
   James Ritchie, the junk shop-keeper alluded to was,
as we before stated, committed and still remains in
prison.
   On his examination yesterday, he stated that he
was born in Scotland, 36 years of age, a commission
agent, resided last at 13 <u>Chesnut</u> street, and by ad-
vice of his counsel, declined answering further ques-
tions.
   From the confession of George Griffin, one of the
thieves, it appears that upwards of 100 bags of coffee,
valued at more than $<u title="2,500 in Herald-1841-06-15">5,000</u> had been stolen from
Messrs. <u>Merles'</u> store at different times since July last,
all of which were purchased by Ritchie for $2 per bag.
George Rankin, another of the thieves, upon his ex-
amination, confessed that he was concerned in steal-
ing the coffee, and that he was first induced to do so
by Ritchie, who asked him to sell some coffee from
<u>Melre</u>'s store.

   ☞ T<small>O THE</small> P<small>UBLIC</small>.—Having been misrepresented in
the reports of some of the prints in regard to an occur-
rence which took place a day or two ago, in which I am
made to appear as the “reputed” husband of Madame
Restell, &c. &c. As she is a lady of some seventy-three
years of age, I must decline the honor of being consid-
ered in that light. Madame Restell is obliged, from the
demands upon her time, to authorise others to act in her
place. On Saturday evening last, a fellow entered
Madame R.'s office, and on being asked his business, made
propositions of an insulting nature to my wife. I was
called, and immediately caned him out of the house, and
had him taken to the watchhouse, where I presume he
spent a very pleasant night, and on the following
morning brought before the police. During the scuffle,
this vagabond charges me with having taken a breast-
pin, for which I shall take measures to prosecute him
criminally; for if our families are to be insulted in our
very houses, and by our firesides, and when summary
steps are taken to chastise the insulter, we are to be
charged with whatever loss of property the infamous
scoundrel may have alleged to have sustained, it be-
comes a question whether we have a right to protect our
families from insult in our own house, without incurring
the risk of being apprehended for larceny. Under such
circumstances no man is safe. This fellow called him-
self by the various names of Thompson, James Brown,
(the name he assumed at the watchhouse) and subse-
quently at the police office, Joseph Brown. He is a ra-
ther tall, light complexioned, silly looking fellow;
wears brass spectacles, and hails from the Atlantic Hotel,
and answers to the description of a fellow going about
town insulting females, which sometime since appeared
in the Sun.			CHARLES LOHMAN, Publisher.

   <i>The Staten Island Mystery</i>—On Monday last, a
“tale of mystery,” fraught with horrors, appeared in
some of the daily papers, all about a certain Mrs.
<u title="Murrell (above)">Morrill</u>, wife of a Greenwich street Dry Goods dealer,
having, with her child, eloped with a dark visaged
<u title="cavalier">cavillier</u>—how she went to a southern city, where
she wsa met by her husband, who took her in charge—
how the husband soon died, and whose body was
brought to Staten Island for burial—how the body
was exhumed on suspicion of deceased having been
poisoned, and all that sort o' thing.
   The truth of the whole matter, as far as we have
been able to ascertain, is in substance as follows:
   About a twelve-month since a Mr. </u>Morrill</u> was in
possession of a dry goods establishment in Green-
wich street—a wife and daughter. His business not
proving so good as he had anticipated, he sold off his
stock and left for Baltimore, there to commence busi-
ness anew. Some time passed without any informa-
tion from him reaching his family, till at length the
news of his death was formally communicated to
them. The intelligence was so authentic in its char-
acter as not to admit of a doubt.
   The widow of course settled her affairs as all wi-
dows do, and should do, shortly after, she was ad-
dressed by the “dark cavalier”—none other than a
Mr. Anderson, well known in this city. Marriage
was proffered and accepted, and soon the nuptial knot
was tied. The honey moon was, however, scarce
over before the veritable Mr. <u>Morrill</u> made his ap-
pearance and laid claim to his wife; Mr. Anderson
of course evacuated the premises, and Mr. <u>Morrill</u> took
possession as in duty bound. The husband, wife and
child left for Baltimore, for a new home which he had
there provided. Shortly after the arrival of the party
there Mr. <u>Morrill</u> was attacked with the cholera mor-
bus, of which he after a six days illness died; he was
regularly attended by a physician, who at his death
gave a regular certificate of the cause thereof. Mrs.
<u>Morrill</u> accompanied the body of her husband to Sta-
ten Island preparatory to its interment by the side of
his foregone relations. The lady in the confusion of
the mournful propensities, had forgotten the physi-
cian's certificate, and the relatives of the deceased
fearful all was not right, called in the coroner to ex-
amine the body.
   An inquest was accordingly held, which resulted in
accordance with the testimony of the afflicted widow.
The burial ceremony was then performed. The inno-
cent prattling child, however, chanced afterward to
lisp something about the marriage of her mother with
the “dark cavalier.” Suspicions of poison, or other
means of violence, were roused anew in the breasts of
the relatives of the deceased, and it was determined
that the body should be disinterred, and a furhter in-
vestigation into the matter had. The body was ac-
cordingly exhumed, a <i>post mortem</i> examination held,
and the stomach and parts adjacent were placed in
charge of Dr. Chilton, of this city, for the purpose of
chemical analysis. The Doctor having carefully and
faithfully analyzed all the contents of the stomach,
has reported to the afflicted and affrighted relatives
that as to the matter of poison, or any other circum-
stances calculated to excite suspicion, he has found—
nothing. And thus the matter ended.

   <i>Rape</i>.—A female named Charlotte Griffin, of 141
Essex street, whose husband is now in prison on
charge of grand larceny, complained on Saturday
at the police, that on the 7th ult. Peter Ritchie, bro-
ther of the notorious coffee receiver, James Ritchie,
now in prison, assaulted her with great violence, and
attempted to commit a rape. Ritchie was arrested,
and committed in default of $1000 bail required.

   T<small>HE</small> S<small>TATEN</small> I<small>SLAND</small> M<small>YSTERY</small>.—We learn from
Dr. Chilton, that no traces of poison are to be found
in the stomach and intestines of the late Mr. <u>Mor-
rill</u>. The lady has returned from Baltimore, and
afforded satisfactory testimony to the friends of the
late Mr. M., that the deceased died from <i>cholera
morbus</i> after six days illness. It seems he had a
strange aversion to the medical profession, and re-
fused to have a doctor up to the fourth day of his
attack. To the remonstrances or entreaties of his
wife, he replied that if he was not better “by to-
morrow, they might send for an herb doctor.” Of
course, he got no relief form such an <u title="empiric">empyric</u>, and
his death on the sixth day need astonish no one.
Under the circumstances of the case, it must be
highly satisfactory to all parties, that a complete in-
vestigation has taken place, and that after the nu-
merous tests, which the skill and science of Dr.
Chilton has submitted the stomach and intestines to,
that no traces of poison has been discovered.
	...
   C<small>HARGE OF</small> R<small>APE</small>.—Peter Ritchie, a brother of
James Ritchie, who is in the tombs for receiving sto-
len goods, was brought up, charged, on the oath of
Charlotte Griffin, with pulling her on a bed, and
thence taking certain liberties, et cetera. Peter said
he did not mean any thing offensive to the lady; but
seeing as how her husband and his brother were both
in the tombs on a charge of felony, why he only
wished to pay her certain little delicate attentions.—
The Magistrate committed Perter to the tombs.

pronounced both the fair ones to be frail, and con-

such, to go to the penitentiary.
   This may be very even-handed justice, but it
strikes us as very likely creating a job for a “Judge

beas corpus, and $10 each in addition, to pay the
fees of the “Judge at chambers,” we know a “high

vagrants to the penitentiary without a jury uncon-

<i>CAUTION TO MARRIED & UNMARRIED LADIES</i>.
<m9><cl>M</cl>ADAME RESTELL, Female Physician, would caution
females against a daring and infamous fraud attempted to
be practised by some unprincipled and disreputable person call-
ing herself “Costello,” by surreptitiously causing the insertion
of an advertisement, (unknown to the editors of the print in
which it appeared,) falsely purporting as coming from “Ma-
dame Restell,” alleging that Madame Restell had removed her
office, and associated herself with this “Costello” woman.
Madame Restell need only here state that no such “removal” or
“association” has taken place, and that the advertisement allu-
ded to was inserted without her knowledge or sanction. This
“Costello” is an impostor, who is by turns a washerwoman, a
cook, sometimes a fortuneteller, and latterly has advertised her-
self herself (by way of change) as “Costello, Female Physi-
cian, graduate from Paris,” and has endeavored to counterfeit
and imitate the subscriber's celebrated “Preventive Powders,”
“Female Monthly Pills,” and her other medicines, against whose
tricks and impositions Madame Restell has cautioned the pub-
lic. Chagrined and disappointed in her schemes, she now re-
sorts to the desperate though shallow falsehood of asserting that
Madame Restell has removed from her own elegant house and
residence to “associate” herself with one of the very persons
against whom her “cautions,” &c. are directed. This ignorant
woman and the quacks who instigate her, will find themselves
mistaken in their estimate of the good sense and discrimination
of the public in this their last desperate but truly pitiful scheme
at brazen imposition.			MADAME C. RESTELL.

<m9><cl>T</cl>O MARRIED WOMEN—MADAME RESTELL, Fe-
male Physician, is happy to have it in her power to say that
since the introduction into this country, about three years since,
of her celebrated Preventive Powders for married ladies, whose
health forbids a too rapid increase of family, hundreds have
availed themselves of their use, with a success and satisfaction
that has at once dispelled the fears and doubts of the most
timid and sceptical; for, notwithstanding that for twenty years
they have been used in Europe with invariable success, (first
introduced by the celebrated Midwife and Female Physician
Madame Restell, the grandmother of the advertiser, who made
this subject her particular and especial study,) still some were
inclined to entertain some degree of distrust, until become con-
vinced by their successful adoption in this country. The re-
sults of their adoption to the happiness, the health, nay, often
the life of many an affectionate wife and a fond mother, are too
vast to touch upon within the limits of an advertisement—re-
sults which affect not only the present well being of parents, but
the future happiness of their offspring. It is not but too well
known that the families of the married often increase beyond the
happiness of those who give them birth would dictate? In how
many instances does the hard working father, and more espe-
cially the mother, of a poor family, remain slaves throughout
their lives, tugging at the oar of incessant labor, toiling to live
and living but to toil; when they might have enjoyed comfort
and comparative affluence; and if care and toil have weighed
down the spirit, and at last broken the health of a father, how
often is the widow left, unable, with the most virtuous inten-
tions, to save her fatherless offspring from becoming degraded
objects of charity or profligate votaries of vice? And even
though competence and plenty smile upon us, how often, alas!
are the days of the kind husband and father embittered in be-

	<f12>MADAME RESTELL'S APPEAL TO
		PHYSICIANS.</f12>
<cl>G</cl>ENTLEMEN,—I take the liberty of addressing you on
a subject the importance of which your daily experience
in the course of your practice fully demonstrates; a subject
which cannot and should not, if it could, be longer trifled with,
connecting itself, as it does, with the health, the well-being,
the happiness of those entrusted to your charge. Feeling a
deep interest in all that tends to alleviate, if not to prevent the
suffering, both physical and mental, often endured by married
females, whose formation being such as, in the event of their
becoming mothers, to destroy health, and not unfrequently en-
danger life.   I address myself to your candor and humanity,
whether it be not but the performance of a duty imposed upon
you as individuals worthy of the confidence you enjoy, as well
as an act alike of justice and humanity to your patients, to take
ordinary pains to convince yourselves that my Preventive Pow-
ders for ladies in such delicate and precarious health, as to for-
bid a too rapid increase of family, are really what they purport
to be, and therefore entitled to the popularity they possess, and
in all respects worthy of recommendation, as being one of the
greatest blessings yet discovered in medical and physiological
science, as destined to rescue many an affectionate wife and
fond mother from sinking into an early and premature grave?
or whether they are to be classed with the innumerable speci-
mens of no definite virtue? It behooves you, gentlemen, to re-
flect that the consequences resulting to the welfare, the health,
the happiness of those adopting the use of these powders are too
serious; their effects either for good or for evil too important
to be treated with the sneer of indifference or the smile of in-
credulity; for if by their adoption health is improved, life
prolonged, much mental and physical suffering prevented, the
pecuniary circumstances of parents advanced, thereby the
means for the proper education of their offspring better provi-
ded for and secured; if, I say, results so beneficial naturally
and necessarily flow from their adoption, (which I can satis-
factorily establish,) you are called upon as men, as husbands,
as fathers, to lay aside your prepossessions as physicians, and
aid in extending and enlarging the circle of their benign influ-
ence, that the blessings to be derived from their adoption may
be spread far and near, and thus be the means of prolonging the
life of many a faithful and affectionate wife, who, but for their
adoption, after lingering out a sickly, and consequently unhap-
py existence, would have been cut off in the midday of <u title="existence">exist-
nece</u> from amidst those whom she was attached by ties most
near and dear. True it is, that from the sordid, the narrow-
minded, or the selfish, nothing can be expected, since the gen-
eral introduction of the “Preventive Powders” will, by remo-
ving the cause of many complaints to which females would other-
wise be subjected, necessarily diminish their practice and abridge
their profits; but surely, the high-minded, the liberal, the up-
right, the honorable, the humane, I trust and hope will not,
from any motive of pecuniary disadvantage to themselves, be
deterred from recommending to married females under their
care and adoption of means at once efficacious, healthy, and cer-
tain. I am the more fully persuaded of this, from the fact that
not a few have been induced to adopt their use, by the advice
and <u title="recommendation">recommenddtion</u> of physicians. While, however, I solicit
your aid in furthering and extending the blessings, the use of
my “Preventive Powders” will confer on those adopting them;
I pledge myself to desist from recommending their use, if their
effects, or the consequences of their adoption, can be shown to
be otherwise than of the greatest possible advantage. The
“Preventive Powders” were first introduced in France about
thirty years ago, by the grandmother of the subscriber, the
well-known and celebrated Madame Restell, for many years
Female Physician in some of the principal Female Hospitals in
Europe; and the efficacy and safety of the “Preventive Pow-
ders” for married ladies whose health will not admit of too ra-
pid increase of family is a sufficient commentary on her ac-
quaintance with medical and physiological science. On their
introduction into this country, the distrust and incredulity at
first entertained, have given place to that confidence naturally
inspired by the success of their adoption, by thousands who
have availed themselves of their use within the three years
since their introduction into the United States. Hoping that
you may give the subject of this appeal that mature considera-
tion which its importance demands,
				I remain,
					With great respect,

<m9>		<f12>FEMALE MONTHLY PILLS.</f12>
<cl>M</cl>ADAME RESTELL, Female Physician, being fully satis-
fied, from her perfect acquaintance with the peculiar phy-
siology and anatomy of the female frame, that most of the
complaints to which females are subject, have their source al-
most invariably in the suppression and irregularity of those
functions of nature to which every female is indebted for
health, strength, cheerfulness, and of consequence, to happi-
ness. To this cause can we attribute those violent and convul-
sive headaches, derangement of the stomach, gnawing in the
side, burning in the chest, disturbed and feverish sleep, fright-
ful dreams, languor, debility, weakness, a most distressing le-
thargy and disinclination to activity or employment, deathly,
sallow, and inanimate complexion, want of appetite, and in
short, the utter prostration of the very susceptibility for the
enjoyment, or even, in many instances, endurance of life, en-
gendering that melancholy of mind and depression of spirit that
make existence itself but a prolongation of suffering and
wretchedness, and which, alas! not unfrequently dooms the un-
happy victim to the perpetration of suicide. Those dreadful
and alarming symptoms are removed in a few days by the use
of the Female Monthly Pills.
   The adoption of the Female Monthly Pills in the Female
Hospitals of Europe, as well as Madame Restell's other reme-
dies, in consequence of their efficacy and safety in all cases of
irregularity or suppression of the menses, from whatever cause
produced, as well as their adoption in this country to the ex-
clusion of the various worthless compounds heretofore offered,
is well known.

	<b>Theatricals in the United States.</b>
   The present state of theatrical in this country
very much resembles the state of the stock markets;
sometimes up, sometimes down—sometimes slightly
prosperous, but mostly depressed and stagnant.—
	...
   Fanny Elssler has at last reached New Orleans,
after making $30,000 in Havana; and the enthu-
siasm was greater there than it has been elsewhere.
She rode on horseback from the levee to the hotel,
and the cushion on which rode was put up at auc-
tion and sold for $200. It is not true that any of the
Southerners compelled her to lengthen her petti-
coats on the stage. She had not engaged in New
Orleans at the last accounts, but is sure to get $800
or $1000 a night, as often as she plays there.
   There are no other new theatrical movements
worth mentioning.

		<b>Court of Oyer and Terminer.</b>
   M<small>ARCH</small> 13.—This tribunal meets this day at 11
o'clock, and it is understood that Judge Gridley, of
the Albany Circuit, is to replace the petulant and
deaf functionary who has hitherto presided in this and
the Circuit Court. The Criminal Calendar only con-
tains one case of any magnitude—that of Ezra White,
with which the public has been sufficiently nau-
seated, and only now wish to be relieve from, even
if it should result in the liberation of a murderer <i>scot
free</i>.
   It is said that the watchman is not forthcoming,
and if so, White's acquittal is certain. Indeed, that
was evident on the first trial, when that witness was
absent until the afternoon of the second day, and had
the late Mr. Graham, hurried, instead of procrasti-
nating the first day's proceedings, a verdict of Not
Guilty must have been the result, before that watch-
man came upon the scene.
   Having taken up, from the very first arrest of
White, a very strong opinion of his guilt, and having
experienced the tender mercies of the very gang that
he was chief of, in this city to the terror of the peace-
able, we cannot but admire the legal tact and foren-
sic ingenuity of Mr. Graham in so perseveringly fol-
lowing all the mazes of the law until his client's li-
beration is almost certain. Our opinion of the mo-
ral effects of such formalities will never be altered,
although White's victim was “never nothing but a
foreigner, and he a native born citizen.”
   The civil calendar is understood to contain more
than 300 cases, so that Judge Gridley will not re-
pose on a bed of roses during his sojourn in New
York.

			<b>Special Sessions.</b>
   M<small>ARCH</small> 13.—This tribunal met on Saturday, in
order to clear out of the tombs, a number of petty
thieves, respectable loafers, and other small fry of
the criminal code.
   <i>Rowdies</i>.—John Haggerty, without the O, was put
to the bar, charged with assaulting a middle aged
lady, by endeavoring to get into a bed where she
and three more were reposing in the arms of Mor-
pheus.
   John's defence was, that another gentleman was
in the room, and that he believed he, John, should
make the party more numerous but not less respec-
table.
   The Court held this defence to be inadmissi-
ble, and sent John Haggerty<u> !</u> to the tombs for 30
days.
   Sally King was tried for assault and battery, and
sent to the tombs for ten days, to see if that would
mend her ways.

	GENERAL SESSIONS.—Yesterday.
   Jane Louisa Riley was tried for grand larceny in
stealing $43 worth of cloth from Messrs. Lozee &
Mott. The jury found her guilty.
   Henry Ketcham was tried and convicted of assault
and battery, and fined $7, which he paid.
   Edward Thompson was tried and convicted of bur-
glary in the third degree, and was sentenced to the
state prison for two years and two months.
   Ann Sharp was tried for assault and battery, with
intent to kill Charles Kelley. The jury found her
guilty of assault only, and the court sentenced her to
the penitentiary six months.
   Emma Francis was tried and convicted of assault
and battery, with intent to kill Michael Higgins with
a knife. The court sentenced her to the state prison
for three years and two months.
   Several others were tried for petty offences and ac-
quitted.
   The Grand Jury came in with a number of bills of
indictment, and also presented as a nuisance, the fur-
niture, and old clothes, and such like articles of mer-
chandise, with which Chatham square and the streets
adjacent are, and have been for a long time continually
filled.
   The Grand Jury also made the following
			PRESENTMENT.
   On closing the arduous labors of their session, the
Grand Inquest cannot refrain from respectfully mak-
ing to the Court the following <i>Presentment</i>:—
   We are aware that the province of the Grand Jury is
mainly to examine such complaints as may be laid be-
fore them against persons accused, or suspected of
crime; but we feel it to be also our privilege as well as
our duty, to act in some degree as guardians of public
morals, as well as of the public weal.
   In this view we feel bound to employ our powers,
as well for the prevention, as for the punishment of
crime.
   Our attention has been strongly drawn to a sub-
ject which we regard as pregnant with incalculable
evils.
   The Court is too well acquainted with fallen human
nature not to know that there are crimes, which but
for the fear of detection, would be much more com-
mon than they now are, and that if this wholesome
restraint shall be removed, the corrupt passions of
thousands would lead them to the violation of all the
principles of virtue, charity and virgin honor.
   We respectfully invite the attention of the court
to the advertisements constantly appearing in the
newspapers of our city, of a certain “Madame Res-
tell and a Madame Costello,” in which, among other
things, they offer to the community an article styled
by them “Preventive Powders,” “preventive <u>of</u> Con-
ception.” We present herewith to the court two
copies of the <i>New York Herald</i> containing these ad-
vertisements. We need not expatiate on the evils
which may grow out of this abomination.
   The enlightened mind of the court will at once per-
ceive the facility thus furnished to those who dread
<i>crime</i>, far less than <i>detection</i>, and how the vile se-
ducer is thus enabled to present to his victim, that
which removes the last fear which remains after his
surmounting all other obstacles. We earnestly pray
that if there is no law that will reach this, which we
present as a <i>public nuisance</i>, the court will take mea-
sures for procuring the passage of such a law.
   Another evil, to which we invite the attention of the
court, is the encouragement afforded to early juvenile
crime, by the practice of keepers of Junk shops of
purchasing from <i>minors</i>.
   A very painful case of this kind has been before the
jury at the present session, among the many com-
plaints which have been preferred against keepers of
such shops as receivers of stolen goods.
   A law forbidding under severe penalties the keepers
of these shops from purchasing any article whatever
from <i>minors</i>, we think will be highly salutary, and
have the effect to drive the numerous youthful prow-
lers for plunder, to seek some respectable and honest
employment.
   These suggestions, the Grand Inquest respectfully
submit to the superior wisdom of the Court, feeling
that they are made from a strong sense of feeling and
a sincere desire to prevent crime, and improve the
morals of our noble city.

		<b>PRESENTMENT.
Madame Restell's Reply to Mr. John D.
   <u>Keese</u> (Druggist,) and other Gentlemen of
   the Grand Jury.</b>
G<small>ENTLEMEN</small>—
   As you have thought proper to overstep the strict
bounds of your duties, and gratuitously, and doubtless
disinterestedly, stepped forward to take under your guar-
dian and fostering care the “public morals” of this “no-
ble city,” you will not, I hope, deem it impertinent in me
to examine briefly the premises and reasons you adduce
to found the very eminent danger to “public morals” you
seem to apprehend from the nature, purpose, intention,
and object of the “Preventive Powders.” I will not
charge you, gentlemen, (as some evil disposed people
would,) with being instigated by sinister, mercenary,
selfish, corrupt, or unworthy motives. I will not, for a
moment, suppose that the cause you have thought proper
to pursue had any—the remotest—reference to any pecu-
niary feeling of one or more of your body. I am suffi-
ciently acquainted with “fallen human nature,” to know
that the wisest, most virtuous, and upright, are not al-
ways exempt from improper influences in their conduct
and duties. The desire to be commended, worthily or
unworthily—a craving to figure before the world as the
stern champions of “public morals,” and thus, by infe-
rence, to be supposed possessed of a goodly share of “pri-
vate morals,” is but natural to “fallen human nature.”
With your motives, therefore, gentlemen, I have nothing
to do, presuming them to be correct.
   But you will pardon me for dissenting from you in the
low estimate of female character which you express in
your presentiment. I cannot subscribe to the monstrous
doctrine that there is no moral principle, no conscious-
ness of right, no instinctive perception of virtue, that ac-
tuates female conduct, instead of the “fear” and “res-
traint” you allege. I cannot conceive how men who are hus-
bands, brothers, or fathers, can give utterance to an idea
so intrinsically base and infamous, that their wives, their
sisters, or their daughters, want but the opportunities and
“facilities” to be vicious; and if they are not so, it is not
from an innate principle of virtue, but from fear. It is
humiliating to find men in this enlightened age, with all
the contracted views and prejudices in regard to morals,
as connected with females, that should make a heathen of
the fifteenth century blush for very shame. What! is
female virtue, then, a mere thing of circumstance and
occasion? Is there but the difference of opportunity be-
tween it and prostitution? Would your wives, and your
sisters, and your daughters, if once absolved from fear,
all become prostitutes?—all sell their embraces for gold,
and descend to a level with the most degraded? Such
abhorrent, detestable, and disgusting estimate of female
virtue, it is hoped may be confined within the narrowest
possible bounds. No high-minded, virtuous and enlight-
ened mind can entertain it. But I distinctly and unequi-
vocally deny that the object, or intention, or effects of my
“Preventive Powders” are such as you seem to imagine;
and am prepared to prove to the satisfaction of even the
most prejudiced mind, that their general and universal
introduction would have a decidedly moral influence, by
inducing early marriages; and in the language of my
“Circular,” “young persons seriously attached to each
other, and who might wish to marry, would marry early,
merely resolving not to become parents until prudence
permitted it. The young man, instead of solitary toil,
or vulgar dissipation, would enjoy the society and the
assistance of her he had chosen as his companion; and
the best years of life, whose pleasures never return,
would not be squandered in riot or debauchery.”
   But it is not in this respect only that the introduction
of the “Preventive Powders” would have a moral effect.
It is well known among physicians, (of which fact you
should have acquainted yourselves,) that there are some
women who cannot, except at the imminent peril of their
lives, and the certain sacrifice of that of their unborn
offspring, give birth. Is it not moral for those to have
the “Preventive Powders” to save their health—their
life? Many weakly wives have been saved from a pre-
mature grave, to be a succor and a blessing to those near
and dear to them. And are we to forego an actual good,
because, if perverted, it may possibly offer “facilities”
to evil? Nor shall we know where to stop, if we follow
up this principle. If you give your sons lessons in me-
chanics? But then you give them “facilities” to pick
locks. If you teach them to read? But they may obtain
“facilities” to falsehood and folly. If you instruct them
in writing? But they may become possessed of “facili-
ties” to forge.
   It is not for me, gentlemen, to advise a respectable bo-
dy of men in the duties belonging to Grand Jurors; but
it suggests itself to me, nevertheless, that too much cir-
cumspection cannot be used in making “presentments,”
to avoid hasty, inconsiderate and injudicious conduct,
bringing the body and the institution into just ridicule
or rebuke. Hoping that nothing herein contained will

   Several messages from the acting Mayor, <i>pro for-

   The presentment of the Grand Jury, in relation
to the advertisement of Mesdames Restell and Cos-

abomination in the noble city,” was read and refer-
red to the committee on police.
   Ald. <u title="Chamberlain ?">Chamberlin</u> made a little bit of a flare up
speech, in which, amidst cries of order, order, he
persisted in saying that the Grand Jurors were over
tenacious of the morals of this noble city, while the
Governor had the power to appoint one for Recorder
who was covered with gross corruption, &c., and he
hoped the committee would take the matter in hand
and enquire into the real character of Fred. A. Tall-

nor, and let the people know what a miserable wretch
“we” have got for a criminal judge.
   At this point in the Alderman's oration, the Presi-

orator was compelled to sit down.
   Among the petitions presented and referred, was
one asking for aid in the procurement of a patent for
an improvement in the manufacture of manure.

		<m8>Reported for the Courier and Enquirer.</m8>
   <i>A Chapter on Mystery, Blood and Murder</i>.—Yes-
terday was an eventful day in our police annals. The
whole town, was throughout the day in a state of in-
tense agitation and excitement. The first great cause
was the arrest and imprisonment of the notorious
<i>Madame Restell</i>.
   The story of her arrest and the cause which led
thereto (in stating which we are compelled for want
of room to be as brief as possible,) is as follows:—
   In the month of May 1839, Mrs. Ann Maria Purdy,
wife of William W. Purdy, then residing in Mott street,
being enceinte, and having at the time a child only ten
months old, resolved upon the adoption of some course
to procure abortion.
   She concealed her intentions from her husband,
and consulted an old negress—the washerwoman for
the family on the subject. Procuring a copy of the
Sun newspaper, she therein found one of Madame
Restell's advertisements. The old negress informed
her that she knew of a young woman in Mulberry
street, who had been relieved by Madame Restell,
without any difficulty whatever.
   On the 1st of June, Mrs. Purdy called at the resi-
dence of Madame Restell, stated her case, and procu-
red a vial, for which she paid one dollar. The con-
tents of which she was directed to take several times
per day, until the desired relief was afforded. Return-
ing to her home, she for several days took the medi-
cine as directed; but becoming alarmed at the symp-
toms which followed, she sent the phial to Dr. D. D.
Marvin, to learn of him the nature of its contents.
Dr. Marvin having examined the medicine, pronoun-
ced it to be a compound of oil of <u title="tansy">tanzey</u> and spirits of
turpentine. He addressed a note to Mrs. Purdy,
stating that the medicine was of a most deleterious
and dangerous character, and could not be administer-
ed without the greatest hazard being incurred.
   The medicine was then laid aside. The female “in
Mulberry street” was consulted, but refused to give
any information as to the course adopted by Restell
in her case.
   Mrs. Purdy then made another visit to Mrs. Res-
tell, and was informed by the latter, that an opera-
tion could be performed by a <i>woman</i> which would
relieve the patient, without causing the least pain or
<u title="inconvenience">inconvience</u>, or danger of exposure. The terms
agreed upon were, that Restell should receive $20 for
her services. Mrs. Purdy said that she was unable
to procure funds without her husband's knowledge
and offered to give to Restell a pledge ticket for a
gold watch worth $20 in lieu of the money. She
then went away, and as agreed upon, at 8 o'clock on
the next evening she called at Madame Restell's. She
was, after a few minutes conversation, taken into a
back dark room, where by Restell and some <i>man</i> to-
gether, a hasty and violent operation was performed
upon her person. She was after this permitted to
leave the room. She was made to promise never to
disclose what had been done, as, said Mrs. Restell,
“it is a <i>state prison offence</i> & you may be made to suf-
fer for it as well as me.” Mrs. Purdy promised never
to made any disclosure, and left the house in a very ex-
hausted state, took an omnibus and rode home. In
a few days she was taken violently ill and was atten-
ded by Dr. Marvin. The Doctor discovered the cause
of her illness, and Mrs. P. declared to him the fact of
her having visited Mrs. Restell, under a pledge of se-
crecy on his part.
   She continued ill and gradually grew worse till
within a few days her situation becoming extremely
critical, Dr. Kirby was called in to consult with Dr.
Marvin. She was pronounced to be past all hopes
of recovery. This decision of the physicians was
communicated to her, and then for the first time she
expressed a desire to disclose all to her husband.
This was on Sunday last. Mr. Purdy on Monday
came to the police and conferred with Mr. Justice
Merritt on the subject; Mr. Merritt issued a warrant,
which he gave in charge of officer Gil Hays, and pro-
ceeded with Mr. Purdy to his residence. Mr. Merritt
found the unfortunate victim in the last stage of hu-
man suffering, though in full possession of her intel-
lectual faculties. A full and detailed statement of the
facts which we have above given in a condensed
form, was taken down from her own lips, to which
she <u title="subscribed">subscibed</u> her name and swore; the deposi-
tion was read to her a second time; she was remind-
ed of the awful situation in which she was placed,
and the dreadful solemnity of the occasion; she, how-
ever, without wavering, declared that all which had
been read to her was true to the letter.
   Mr. Hays proceeded to the residence of <u>Mad-
dame</u> Restell, where he found her giving audience to
some half a score of her patients in a splendidly fur-
nished parlor, and her <i>husband</i> (?) “Charles Loh-
man,” employing himself the while in an adjoining
apartment in preparing packages of the “Preventive
Powders.” Mr. Hays made known his errand, when
Madame R. demanded his authority, and refused to
accompany him.
   Her name, she said, was not Madame Restell, but
Lohman, the wife of Charles Lohman. She only
“acted as the agent of Madame Restell, of Paris.”
All this talk, however, did not avail her any thing
or frighten Mr. Hays from his purpose, and after
some <u title="parley">parly</u> both Madame Restell and her husband
Charles Lohman, accompanied the officer to the house
of Mr. Purdy, corner of Bowery and Broome street.
   Upon her being brought into the presence of Mrs.
Purdy, the latter readily recognized her as the wo-
man, who more than a year previous had given her
the fatal advice. Mr. Charles Lohman was suffered
to depart, but Madame Restell was conducted to the
tombs, where she was fully committed, there to await
the almost certain event of Mrs. Purdy's death, and
of her own consequent trial. Mrs. Purdy is but 21
years and 6 months of age, and has been married 3
years. She was at last accounts sill living, but ex-
pected to survive but a few hours.

   <i>Chapter 2d.—Sacrifice of another Female through
Ignorance and Malpractice</i>.—Another cause of the ex-
citement prevalent yesterday, was the discovery on
the evening previous of the body of a beautiful young
female, concealed in a box, in Oliver street, in the
neighborhood of the residence of a noted “female
physician,” named Mrs. Bird <i>alias</i> Dawson, in Oliver
street.
   About six o'clock on Monday evening, Mr. Jona-
than Lyon, cartman to Messrs. <u title="Butterfield">Butterfied</u> & Coach-
mon, auctioneers, of Chatham square, was applied to
to convey a <i>long box</i> from No. 20 Orange street to No.
18 Oliver street. The box was taken to the house,
where <i>something</i> was put into it, and it was again put
upon the cart and removed to the house of Mr. John
K. Cowperthwaite, corner of East Broadway and
<u title="Catherine">Catharine</u> street. The circumstance of the box being
somewhat heavier upon coming out of the house than
when it went in, excited Lyons's suspicions, and upon
enquiry, learning that No. 18 was the residence of
the “female physician,” he felt assured that all was
“not right,” and communicated his suspicions to
Mr. Butterfield. The latter sent for officer McGrath,
the coroner and a magistrate, who came, and causing
the box to be opened, it was found to contain the body
as aforesaid. The body was sent to the dead-house,
Park, and yesterday an inquest was held thereon. It
appeared the deceased was born in Connecticut. Her
name was <i>Maria E. Shaw</i>—was twenty years of age,
and till recently resided with her mother, Mrs. Eliza
Hill, in Twentieth street.
   Some weeks since, she being <i>enceinte</i>, came to re-
side with Mrs. Bird, and arranged that her stay should
be prolonged till after her delivery. In a few days
she was taken ill, and was attended by Dr. James
Wright, from the 25th of February till March 11th,
when he ceased visiting her. She was then in feeble
health, but convalescent. The Doctor on leaving,
cautioned Mrs. Bird of the necessity of having a
medical man present on the occasion of her patient's
delivery; this was, however, not attended to. She
was on Sunday about noon delivered of a living fe-
male child. Some unfavorable symptoms ensued,
and Dr. Wright was called in, and about the same
time, Mrs. Hill, mother of deceased arrived. The
Doctor found that some wrong practice had been re-
sorted to, prescribed for deceased, and left. In about
there hours afterwards she was a <i>corpse</i>!
   Mrs. Hill, on her examination, stated that deceased
was always a delicate person, and she had for some time
supposed her to be in a decline. I have visited her
frequently since she had been at Mrs. Bird's. I was
not present at her confinement, but arrived shortly
afterwards. She was attended by Mrs. B. Dr.
Wright arrived after it was over. She was delivered
about 12 o'clock on Sunday, and she died on the
same day. Dr. Wright attended her about three
weeks before her confinement at my request. De-
ceased was not married.
   Margaret Dawson, on her examination stated that
she was the “lady” who answered to the name of
Mrs. Bird. I use this name in my professional busi-
ness. I am a midwife—have practised about twenty
seven years. My business is to board ladies who are
enceinte. Mary E. Shaw was sick at the time she
came to me. I attended her during her confinement
—the labor was not difficult or protracted. The
child is a female, and is still living. Here the wit-
ness recited what occurred after the delivery. She
became alarmed and sent for Dr. Wright. The rea-
son for wishing to have the deceased interred private-
ly, was on account of the disgrace of having an illegi-
timate child. The arrangements was made with Mr.
Cowperthwaite.
   Dr. Wright was consulted as to the expedience of
procuring a private burial, and advised that it should
not be done, as such proceedings always excited sus-
picions. Mr. Cowperthwaite was however consulted
and consented to undertake for a stipulated consider-
ation to remove the body to his own house and have
it buried in the Houston and Chrystie street burial
ground on Tuesday at 10 o'clock. Dr. Wright certi-
fied to the ability of Mrs. Bird as a midwife, and stated
that she had been employed on several occasions by
himself, the late Dr. Bushe and others. The Doctor
gave a certificate that deceased died of <i><u title="uterine haemorrhage">werine hæm-
orhage</u></i>. Doctors Gilman and Cooledge examined
the body after death, and concurred in opinion with
Dr. Wright as to the cause of death.
   The jury after hearing the testimony retired, and
after a two hours discussion on the propriety of <i>pre-
senting</i> Mrs. Bird, as having been instrumental in the
death of deceased, agreed upon the following verdict:
   “It is the opinion of this jury from the facts elici-
ted that Maria E. Shaw was in a very precarious
state of health and much debilitated when she came
to the hands of Mrs. Bird, and that it was highly im-
proper on the part of Mrs. Bird that she did not call
in a medical man to assist her in the <u title="accouchement">accouchment</u> of
deceased, and that she died in <i>child-bed</i>.
<a id="Courier-1841-03-24-ch3-Angel-Magnetism"></a>
   <i>Chapter 3d.—Another mystery, and about a female</i>.
—This is a case which is as the police officers say
“not ripe.” We can only give the circumstances as
they came to our knowledge, in the abstract, and fur-
nish the details on a future occasion.
   The information which has reached the magis-
trates is in brief as follows:
   A certain Dr. <u>Collier</u> has been for some days past
lecturing at Peale's Museum on the science of Animal
Magnetism. The principle subject upon which he
operated was a young female, a recent graduate of a
flash house of ill fame, named <i><u>Angeline Sinclair</u></i>. She
was pretty, rather intellectual, but in a very <u title="delicate">delecate</u>
state of health. She was with another young <i>lady</i>
introduced by the Doctor to a genteel boarding house
in Broadway, kept by a Mrs. T——. It was here dis-
covered that her reputation was none of the best, and
she was furnished with notice “to quit.” She was
however taken ill and obliged to remain. On Satur-
day evening last, she was taken suddenly worse, and
died before midnight. A respectable elderly gentle-
man, a boarder in the house was called up to assist
in “carrying out” the body. He found the body on
the floor in the room, cut and mangled in the most
horrid manner, (probably for anatomical purposes)
and exhibiting a most revolting and disgusting spec-
tacle. On Sunday morning the body was put into a
box and removed from the house, and since then no
trace of it has been found. Such are the facts as com-
municated to the coroner. What will be the result
of the investigation remains to be seen, at present the
matter is to the inmates of the house rather an <u title="= excitable">ex-
citeable</u> mystery.

			<b>City Intelligence.</b>
   T<small>HE</small> A<small>RREST OF</small> M<small>ADAME</small> R<small>ESTELL</small>.—At a late
hour on Monday night, Caroline Lohman, who goes
under the <i title="nom de guerre">nom deguerre</i> of Madame Restell, was ar-
rested at her house in Greenwich street, and placed
in the tombs. The detention of this celebrated per-
sonage is for causing an abortion to a respectable
married female, so long ago as <u title="1840, not 1839?">last</u> summer, and
which would not have come to light but for the fact
of the married lady being now in <i>extremis</i>, and hav-
ing charged the nostrums of Madame Restell as the
cause of her illness. The sufferer, whose name is
Ann Maria Purdy, wife of William <u>H.</u> Purdy, of
Mott street, has made an affidavit, which occupies
nearly twelve folios, and much of the matter there
related is obviously unfit for the public eye. She
says that she is now 21 years of age, and has been
married three years and better. In the month of
May, 1839, she found herself pregnant, and having
then a sucking child, she was very desirous of get-
ting some relief. She talked with a negro wench
on the subject, and the negro said, that if the lady
would read the Sun newspaper, she could see some-
thing there which might tell her how to get relieved
from her burthen. The wench also said, that she
knew a lady in Mulberry street who had read the
Sun, and been in consequence to Madame Restell,
and got relief. Mrs. Purdy, on hearing this got the
Sun, and the negro wench explained the advertise-
ment to her, and about the 1st of June she went to
Madame Restell's and stated her case. Madame
said, for one dollar she would give her a medicine to
cause abortion—and on Mrs. Purdy's paying that
sum, she gave her a small phial containing a yellow
liquid, telling Mrs. Purdy that she must take some
drops of that on a piece of sugar. Mrs. Purdy took
the nostrum home, and took some, but not liking it,
she sent it by a girl to a Dr. Marvin, who said it was
oil of tansy and spirits of turpentine, and a very
dangerous thing to take.
   Mrs. Purdy then consulted the negro wench
again, and having obtained from her the name of
the lady who before consulted Madame R., she went
to her house in Mulberry street, but the lady refused
to give any information about the matter. Mrs. Pur-
dy then visited the house of Madame R., and an
arrangement was made between the ladies, for Mrs.
Purdy to have an operation performed on paying
a fee of $20 in money, or “money's worth.” At
the hour appointed, Mrs. Purdy went to Madame
R., and was taken “behind the curtain,” where to
her great alarm, she found a man, which fact made
her fear she had got into a bad house.<u title="No pair for this">”</u> This man
performed an operation on her, and told her that
most likely she would be sick, and have to employ
a physician, as also give up suckling her infant.—
Mrs. Purdy then left, and got into an omnibus, but was
taken very sick in the vehicle and nearly fainted be-
fore she got home. Before she left Madame Res-
tell's, Caroline Lohman told her that it was a State
Prison offence, and that she, Mrs. P., ran more
risk in the event of a discovery, than herself.
   On the Sunday after this operation, she sent for
Dr. David D. Marvin, and on the following Tuesday
she was delivered of <u title="foetus">fœtus</u>, the after-birth of which
did not come away until the following Friday.
  As Mrs. P. got worse, she disclosed the facts to
her doctor, and on Monday she confessed the facts
to her husband, who took the necessary steps to have
the whole affair placed before the police magistrates,
who immediately placed a warrant in the hands <u>of
of</u> Gil Hays, who proceeded to Greenwich street,
and there saw the lady known as Madame Restell,
lecturing to several, very, interesting looking young
ladies. At sight of the officer, Madame Restell
dismissed her auditory, and asked Gil what he want-
ed; he said he had a warrant for the arrest of Ma-
dame Restell, on which “the lady” asked to see it,
and then said her name was Caroline Lohman, and
that was her husband.
   Gil immediately took them both to the house of
Mrs. Purdy, where “the lady” was identified by
the poor victim as the one who had been present
when the operation was performed. On this the
officer reconducted Caroline Lohman and her hus-
band to the Tombs, where the former was locked
up, and the latter let loose.

   C<small>ORONER'S</small> O<small>FFICE</small>.—M<small>ELANCHOLY</small> A<small>FFAIR</small>.—An in-
quest was impanelled under the direction of Dr. Ar-
cher, to enquire into the cause of the death of Maria E.
Shaw, the young female whose body was found in a
box, by two gentlemen, on a cart in Chatham square,
on Monday night, as related in the Herald of yester-
day.
   It appeared that the deceased was twenty years
and six months old, a native of Connecticut, and the
daughter of a Mrs. Eliza Hill, in 20th street. About
eight weeks ago, the deceased went to board with
Margaret Dawson, <i>alias</i> Mrs. Bird, at No. 18 Oliver
street, being at the time pregnant of an illegitimate
child. She was attended by a Dr. Wright until with-
in a few days of her confinement, which took place
last Sunday, and her mother was sent for and came
immediately. She advised the sending for Dr.
Wright, who came, and finding that the <u title="placenta">placentia</u>
had not been moved, advised the usual remedies.
The child was living and doing well, but the mother
continued to sink, and died of <u title="uterine hemorrhage">exterine hermorrhage</u>.
   Mrs. Dawson and Dr. Wright were both examined
at great length, and a post mortem examination of
the deceased had, by some medical gentlemen, but
nothing of any importance was elicited, except that
the poor girl had been sent to Mrs. Bird to avoid ex-
posure, and that the father of her child was a Mr.
Rodgers, living up town.
   The jury were locked up for two hours, and ten of
them were, at one time, for presenting Mrs. Bird,
the midwife, as the cause of the girl's death; but
they eventually agreed on the following verdict:—
   “It is the opinion of this Jury from the facts elici-
ted, that Maria E. Shaw was in a very precarious
state of health, and much debilitated when she came
to the house of Mrs. Bird, that she did not call in a
medical man to assist her in the <u title="accouchement">accouchment</u> of de-
ceased, and that she died in child-bed.”
   The Coroner also held three other inquests, but
none of which possessed any public interest.
   A<small>NOTHER</small> M<small>YSTERIOUS</small> C<small>ASE</small>.—On Monday an ap-
plication was made to the Coroner to investigate the
death of one <u title=" 'alias' Angelica St. Clair">Angelique Sinclair</u>, a girl who had once
been on the town, but who had latterly been en-
gaged by one Dr. Collyer and other professors of
animal magnetism, to be experimented on, at Peale's
Museum. Another girl was also retained, and the
pair put to board at the house of a Mrs. Theall, ad-
jacent to the Museum. Last week Mrs. Theall told
<u>Angelique</u> that she must quit, but the girl was ill at
the time, and permitted to remain. On Saturday
Dr. Collyer went to her room to prescribe, and while
there a message was sent to a gentleman boarding
in the house, to come and see <u>Angelique</u>, which in-
vitation the gentleman did not accept. Some hours
after he heard she was dead, and went up to the
room and saw Dr. C. performing several experiments
on the body, aided by some very juvenile profes-
sors of surgery and anatomy. When this party had
concluded their experiments, they cut up the body
of the girl and sent it off in a box, since which it has
not been heard of, nor has the Doctor been seen
since Sunday. The whole affair is thought to be
<u title="pregnant">pregnent</u> with suspicion, and as the excitement was
pretty high, we have thought it best to give our
readers such facts as have come to our reporter, even
though the disclosure man be deemed “a premature
one.”

   P<small>OLICE</small> O<small>FFICE</small>.—<i>Mde. Restell</i>, a woman who
had been recently presented by the Grand Jury
for the infamous mode in which she obtains a
living—by ministering drugs, and, as the case in
hand proves, causing surgical operations to be per-
formed, for the purpose of producing abortion—
was yesterday arrested and committed to prison,
on a charge of manslaughter.
   The sufferer was a Mrs. Purdy, wife of Wm.
Purdy, an agent of the Harlem Railroad. This
inconsiderate woman, desirous, it seems, to avoid
becoming a mother, in an evil hour applied to
Mde. Restell. We cannot pursue the detail, but
the result was, that drugs not sufficing, she suffer-
ed an operation to be performed; since which, her
health has steadily declined, and at the point of
death, as she believes, and other think too proba-
ble, disclosed the whole matter to her husband,
before kept in ignorance thereof.
   He applied to Justice Merritt, who, after taking
the dying deposition of Mrs. Purdy, caused the
arrest and commitment of Mde. Restell.

   Another case of excitement, connected with the
death of an unmarried woman who died in the
house of a midwife, and whose body was privately
taken away for interment, occupied the courts.
The victim was Maria E. Shaw, aged 20, who
went to the house of a woman named Bird, <i>alias</i>
Dawson, in Oliver street, and there died in child-
bed. The private interment, it was alleged, was
to prevent exposure of the deceased to shame.
   The Coroner's inquest agreed in the verdict.
   “It is the opinion of this jury, from the facts
elicited, that Maria E. Shaw was in a very preca-
rious state of health, and much debilitated, when
she came to the hands of Mrs. Bird, and that it
was highly improper on the part of Mrs. Bird, that
she did not call in a medical man to assist in the
<u title="accouchement">accouchment</u> of deceased, and that she died in
<i>child-bed</i><u title=".”">.</u>

   M<small>ADAME</small> R<small>ESTELL IN</small> P<small>RISON ON A CHARGE OF</small>
M<small>ANSLAUGHTER</small>.—This woman, who has render-
ed herself infamously notorious, is at last in a fair
way to meet her deserts. The following is the
charge on which she has been arrested. In May,
1839, Mrs. <u title="Ann (elsewhere)">Anne</u> Purdy, wife of Mr. William Pur-
dy, an agent of the Harlem Railroad Company, who
was then only about nineteen years old, became
<u title="enceinte"><i>enciente</i></u> of her second child, having at the time
another child ten months old which she was nurs-
ing. The prospect of having a second child while
the other was yet so young, was extremely annoy-
ing to her, and at the suggestion of her servant, a
colored woman, she applied to Madame Restell to
prevent her becoming again a mother. Madame
Restell accordingly gave her a phial containing a
colored liquid, of which Mrs. Purdy took one or
two doses, without producing the desired effect,
but attended with such other unpleasant feelings,
that Mrs. Purdy fearing it might be unwholesome,
sent it to a medical gentleman in order to ascertain
what were its ingredients. This gentleman inform-
ed her that it was compound of <u title="tansy">tanzy</u> and turpen-
tine, and that it was extremely dangerous to use it
as an internal medicine, and Mrs. Purdy in conse-
quence <s>discontinued</s> the use of it; but being still
anxious to effect her purpose, she again <s>applied to</s>
Madame Restell, who informed her that she could
perform a surgical operation on her person, which
would have the desired effect; for performing
which Madame Restell told her, she received from
$40 to $50 according to the circumstances of the
patient, but ultimately consented to do it in the
present instance for $20.
   As Mrs. Purdy could not conveniently procure
this sum without the knowledge of her husband,
from whom she wished to conceal the matter, she in
a few days after called on Madame Restell and de-
posited with her the pledge ticket for a gold watch;
also, gave her one dollar, being all the money Mrs.
Purdy had with her, and which Madame Restell
insisted on being given to her along with the ticket.
Having thus received her fee or what she deemed
sufficient security for it, Madame Restell then
brought Mrs. Purdy behind a curtain which was in
the room, and a blanket being laid on the
floor Mrs. Purdy was placed on it, and an
operation was performed on her person by a
man, and she immediately after went home
in the omnibus, where she arrived with great diffi-
culty, from the extreme weakness and pain, conse-
quent upon the operation she had undergone. In
two or three days after her visit to Madame Restell,
the operation proved successful in producing a pre-
mature <u title="accouchement">accouchment</u>. And from that time to the
present Mrs. Purdy has never enjoyed a moment's
health and has gradually declined and rapidly ap-
proached her dissolution, in the last stage of con-
sumption.
   Having within the last few days been informed
by her physician that the end of her earthly exis-
tence was at hand, and that she could not possibly
survive many days longer, she thought it her duty
to inform her husband of what she had every reason
to believe had been the cause of her lost health and
approaching death. The husband, on being inform-
ed of it, applied to Justice Merritt, who immediate-
ly waited on Mrs. Purdy and procured, what may
be called, her dying deposition of the above facts,
and then had Madame Restell arrested and commit-
ted to prison on a charge of manslaughter.—<i>Jour-
nal of Commerce</i>.

in an apparently mysterious manner, from the house
of a Mrs. Bird, a doctress who resides in Oliver
street. The Coroner having heard of the occur-
rence, traced the body to the house of an undertaker
in East Broadway, and had it removed to the dead
house in the Park, where an inquest was held on
it. From the evidence adduced at the inquest it
seemed that the deceased was an unmarried woman,
named <u title="Maria E. Shaw (elsewhere)">Mary Dawson</u>, who went to reside at Mrs.

and died there in her <u title="accouchement">accouchment</u>. Verdict accor-

	...
   F<small>RACAS</small>.—A fracas arising out of the foregoing
case, took place, yesterday morning, at the house
of Mrs. Theall, between Algernon H. Griswold <u>and
and</u> Robert H. Collyer. Mr. G. came to the police
and had a warrant issued against his medical anta-
gonist, and the latter was held to bail. The fair wi-
dow, Mrs. Theall, became surety for the Doctor,
to the amount of $300.
   The Doctor subsequently applied to Justice Mer-
ritt, for a cross warrant, but up to the time for leav-
ing the office, it was not granted.
   T<small>HE</small> C<small>ASE OF</small> M<small>ADAME</small> R<small>ESTELL</small>, <i>alias</i> C<small>AROLINE</small>
L<small>OHMAN</small>.—This celebrated personage was brought
out for examination, on the charge of aiding and
abetting some unknown person in the causing of a
premature delivery of a Mrs. Ann Maria Purdy.
   “The lady” was attended by Messrs. Jordan and
<u>Morrell</u> as counsel.
   Justice Merritt explained the charge, and inform-
ed her of her rights. The Clerk was then proceed-
ing to put the first question—“What is your age,
place of birth, business, residence,” &c., when “the
lady” cut him short by saying “that under the ad-
vice of her counsel she should decline answering any
questions, but for herself she could say she was in-
nocent of that charge.”
   The Magistrate said he should not fix the amount
of bail that night, and thus ended the 2d act of the
drama, which had kept the whole police establish-
ment in a ferment of excitement throughout the day.

   A<small>TTEMPT AT</small> R<small>APE</small>.—James Reed, a young butcher,
was brought up charged with an attempt to commit
a rape on the person of a girl named <u>Mary Ann Mil-
lett</u>, only 9 years of age. The details are unfit for
publication.
	...
   C<small>UTTING</small> O<small>FF</small> H<small>EADS</small>.—A very novel case of assault
and battery was tried Wednesday, in the Court of Com-
mon Pleas. It was a suit brought by a <u title="cartman">carman</u>
against a butcher, to recover a compensation in dama-
ges for nearly severing the plaintiff's head from his
body. The facts lay in a nut shell, as the lawyers
say. Defendant had a ferocious dog, which bit the
plaintiff's child, and the latter insisted on the dog
being hanged. A week after the execution of the
dog the butcher got the cartman into his slaughter
house, seized him by the nape of the neck, and actu-
ally cut his throat with a big knife, from the spinal
ridge round to the right jaw, before the cartman was
rescued from his perilous situation. The wounded
man was taken to the hospital, and he had the good
fortune to get cured, as the butcher had missed the
<i>carotid artery</i>.
   For the defence it was set up that the butcher was
insane, and that lunatics were not answerable for
either <u title="trespass">tresspass</u> or tort.
   This point was argued at great length, and finally
reserved for the opinion of the Court above.
   Testimony to the insanity or delirium tremens of
the defendant was adduced, and the jury gave the
plaintiff $500 damages.
   For plaintiff, W. M. Price, for defendant, J. T.
Brady.
   The proceedings in the Civil Courts yesterday were
of no interest, except to the parties litigating and
their legal advisers.

   <i>The Restell Case</i>.—Madame Restell, the “notor-

for examination. Her Counsel, Messrs. Morrill and

declined answering any questions. She declared
herself innocent of the charge and was remanded.—

the Police by John Ehler, Secretary of the Patent
Fire-Arms Company, that a young man, clerk in the
Company's employment at their warehouse, 155 Broad-
way, had embezzled money and property to the a-
mount of upwards of $700. A warrant was issued
for the arrest of the delinquent.

   <i>Rape</i>.—A young butcher named James Reed, was
yesterday arrested on charge of attempting to com-
mit a rape on a little girl, 9 years of age, named
<u>Mary Jane Millett</u>, in the house of Benjamin Jacax,
204 16th street. Reed was committed.

   <i>The Broadway Mystery</i>.—Mr. Coroner Archer on
Tuesday evening, proceeded to investigate the mat-
ter of the death of <u>Angeline St. Clair</u>, to which we al-
luded in our paperof yesterday. It appeared that she
had been for some days ill of <u title="erysipelas">erysipilis</u>, though she
was able to attend the lectures of Doctor Collyer, in
the evening. She was attended by Drs. Schmidt
and Oakley, who gave a certificate of the cause of her
death. She was buried by the public authorities on
Sunday. The causes which led to the complaint be-
fore the coroner upon explanation appear far less
horrible than were at first represented. Dr. Collyer
appears to be in no wise censurable in the premises.
   The excitement growing out of the affair led to the
arrest yesterday of Dr. Collyer, on charge of assault
and battery committed by him on Algmoon S. Gris-
wold, a gentleman residing in the same house, 231
Broadway. The Doctor was required to find bail in
$300, which he procured. Mrs. Theall, landlady of
the house, becoming herself his security. The Doctor
then made application for a warrant against Mr. Gris-
wold, charging him with having committed the first
assault.

<b>Madame Restell—Strange Developments com-
   ing—Necessity for vigorous action on the
   part of the Recorder.</b>
   The arrest of Madame Restell, the sudden death
of Maria Shaw, and the story of the post mortem
examination of <u title=" 'alias' Angelique Sinclair">Angelica St. Clair</u>, the girl who had
been assisting in illustrating animal magnetism at
Peale's Museum, have produced a great sensation
in this community, and caused an inquiry into the
condition of public and private morals in this city.
The case of Madame Restell is much the most cu-
rious, and involves the most serious consequences.
Her trial will produce developments the most cu-
riuos, the most startling, the most astounding, that
ever were witnessed in this or any other country.
   Some anxiety has been manifested, to know who
Madame Restell is, her appearance, character, and
history. It is a short story and soon told.
   The person who is now in prison, under the name
of Madame Restell, is an Englishwoman, about
thirty years old, of youthful appearance, with a
bright, intelligent eye, and rather a prepossessing
face. She came to this country about ten years
since, with her husband, bearing the name of Som-
ers. Her husband was a tailor, and worked in one
of the most fashionable establishments in this city.
Mrs. Somers also worked for the same establishment,
and was distinguished for the neatness and rapidity
with which she made vests and pantaloons.
   About five years ago, Somers died, and his widow
subsequently married a Russian of the name of Loh-
man, a printer. He is a shrewd, cunning fellow,
and has written her advertisements, puffs, handbills,
&c. A couple of years after their marriage, busi-
ness called Lohman to Europe. He took his wife
with him, and left her in Paris, while he went to
Russia. While in Paris, Mrs. Lohman became ac-
quainted with Madame Restell, a very celebrated
<i>accoucheur</i> and physician. From her Mrs. Lohman
acquired a knowledge of the practices which she has
followed here, and for which she is now in prison.
   On her return from Europe, she opened a shop in
this city, and adopting the title of Madame Restell,
offered her services to all who stood in need of them.
Shortly after, there was a good deal of talk about
town, and many mysterious hints were heard of cer-
tain curious cases, and threats of strange develop-
ments were muttered, but nothing definite or tangi-
ble came out, and all interest in the matter gradually
died away. Her establishment in Greenwich street
was thronged at all hours. Half a dozen persons
were frequently seen there of a morning before the
shop was open. The most elegant and fashionable
carriages in the city often drew up at her door, a ser-
vant would be sent in, and Madame Restell come out
and enter the carriage. Sometimes the carriage
would drive away with her, and sometimes it would
remain at the door for half an hour or more, with her
inside. Her practice was immense, and among all
classes of people, and she has now between five hun-
dred and six hundred letters, many of them from
ladies in the highest circles of fashionable society,
some married and some single, in this city and else-
where, acknowledging the benefits they had derived
from her ministrations, and thanking her, many of
them, in the warmest terms, for her advice and pre-
scriptions.
   What will be Madame Restell's course with these
letters when she is brought to trial? Will she not
offer them in justification of her conduct? Will she
not plead, that practices which drew from such re-
spectable patients the most animated encomiums,
should be looked at with an eye of lenity?
   We regard the arrest of this woman, and the dis-
closures consequent upon it which must follow, as an
interposition of Providence to crush the whole cor-
rupt fashionable society of this city to atoms. Ma-
dame Restell has been an accomplice with the de-
moralized portion of society, in violating the laws of
God and man. Young unmarried females, moving
in the highest circles, have applied to her for aid,
and she has the evidence of the fact under their own
hands. Men who pretend to be leaders in churches,
leaders of fashion, and leaders of finance in Wall
street, are connected with these extraordinary deve-
lopments. Now is the time to assert the majesty of
the laws, and vindicate our courts from all imputa-
tion or suspicion of winking at iniquity or powerful
connections. Those charged with the execution of
the laws must go on, and rip up the whole of these
dark transactions. There must be no smothering
up, no concealment, no evasion. It is due alike to
the pure and unspotted of our city, and to the sanc-
tity of the laws, that there should be an investigation,
deep though rough. We rely with confidence upon
the determination and energy of Recorder Tallmadge
in this emergency, notwithstanding the mean and
malignant attacks of the Journal of Commerce and
the rest of the sanctified hypocrites, who say to every
man not of their set, “stand by, for I am holier than
thou.” Whatever pranks and foibles may have
characterised his boyish days, he has nothing to
fear in a comparison with most of those who now
pursue him with fiend-like malice. He will do his
duty, and insist upon a thorough, searching scrutiny
into all the circumstances now for the first time de-
veloping the corrupt and demoralised state of fash-
ionable society in this country. Awful disclosures
are coming!

   <i>Madame Restell</i>.—In the case of this notorious
female, Mr. Justice Merritt, after consulting with His
Honor the Recorder, and the District Attorney, de-
cided yesterday morning, to admit her to bail in
$5000 with good sureties. Several <i>respectable</i> individ-
uals presented themselves as bail, but on their learn-
ing that their names would go forth to the world, in
<u title="juxtaposition">juxta-position</u> with that of the woman herself, and as
<d>[Col.4]</d>
semi-accessories in her crimes, they very properly
withdrew. An intense excitement prevails among the
citizens in the upper part of the city—in the neighbor-

should Madame Restell succeed in procuring bail,
that some violence will be attempted upon her person,
or at least her residence.

in the tombs, not having yet procured bail. The
bail demanded has been reduced to $3000. The in-
terest in this case seems not to abate at all. Seve-
ral persons about town have undertaken to make an
outcry on account of our comments upon the disclo-
sures that an investigation would produce. This is
unwise. Those who exclaim against the tone of our
remarks, subject themselves to the suspicion of being
implicated in some of the woman's transactions. None
whose hands are clean can apply anything we have
said to themselves. The existence of such an estab-
lishment as Madame Restell's in this country, fur-
nishes abundant evidence of the spread of corruption
among the fashionable circles. It is a damning fact
which no clamor can remove. The prosecution of
Madame Restell may be quashed, all judicial inves-
tigation may be stifled, but the dark spot can never
be effaced. We have more to say on this subject

   T<small>HE</small> C<small>ASE OF</small> M<small>ADAME</small> R<small>ESTELL</small>.—The counsel for
this person got out a writ of habeas corpus and
had her brought before Judge Inglis for the purpose
of getting the bail reduced or ascertaining if the Po-
lice Justices had not permitted some irregularity to
creep into their proceedings, by which a discharge
could have been effected. About 4 o'clock the pri-
soner was brought up in the custody of Hyde, the
jailer, and she had scarcely been in his Honor's room
five minutes ere the place was filled to repletion by
the veriest set of loafers<u> </u>it was our ill fortune to en-
counter in a similar confined situation. The very
windows of the office, and the tables were occupi-
ed with the lady's admirers, and it was only by re-
moving <u>Madam</u> into an inner room out of the sight
of her numerous friends and disciples, that his Honor
was enabled to proceed.
  Messrs. <u>Jordon</u> and <u>Morrell</u> both urged upon his
Honor the impossibility of the accused getting bail
in the sum of $5,000, and the injury which her health
must suffer if detained in prison until her trial could
be brought on. The learned and eloquent gentle-
men also called his Honor's attention to several tech-
nical objections to the proceedings. Mr. Whiting,
on the part of the people, said that the bail was not
too high. That in the case of Glentworth similar
sureties had been required and given. That the
offences charged against this woman were notorious
as the sun at noonday. The press had teemed with

of excessive bail, founded on any newspaper para-
graphs, or <u title="outdoor">out-door</u> prejudices, set afloat possibly by
men as corrupt, if not as depraved as his client was

	BEFORE JUDGE INGLIS—At Chambers.
   <i>Madame Restell</i>.—This notorious personage was
brought before Judge Inglis yesterday afternoon on
a writ of Habeas Corpus. She was accompanied
from the “Tombs” to the City Hall by her <i>husband</i>
(?) Charles Lohman, and Capt. Hyde, and closely at-
tended by a troupe of loafers and rowdies, whose curi-
osity was excited by the novelty of the scene and the
occasion. Within and around the Judge's chambers
a dense crowd of citizens assembled, all eager to sa-
tisfy their curiosity by a glimpse at the woman.
   The pressure of the crowd became at length so
great that, Judge Inglis was compelled to order the
prisoner to be removed to an <u title="anteroom">ant-room</u>, adjoining
the office. Upon this the excitement partially subsi-
ded and a portion of the crowd dispersed. His Honor
was then enabled to proceed to business.
   Messrs. Morrill & Jordan, counsel for the prisoner
moved for a reducing of bail (5,000) and argued that
the bail should be fixed at a mere nominal sum. The
motion was opposed by J. R. Whiting, Esq., District
Attorney.
   The motion was argued at some length by the
counsel on either side, and at the conclusion of the ar-
gument, His Honor took the matter into considera-
tion, remarking, that he would render a decision at an
early hour this morning.
   Madame Restell attended as before, with some dif-
ficulty made her egress through the crowd, and was
returned to her old quarters, at the city prison.
   We did not learn that any persons presented them-
selves as her bail.

   H<small>ABEAS</small> C<small>ORPUS</small>—M<small>ADAME</small> R<small>ESTELL</small>.—This
woman was yesterday, at 4 o'clock, taken out of
prison, and carried before Judge Inglis, at Cham-
bers, in the City Hall, on a writ of Habeas Corpus,
in order as well to test the validity of her imprison-
ment, on the charges preferred, as to obtain a re-
duction in the amount of bail. Her counsel, Messrs.
Jordan and Morrill attended, and the former not
only took sundry technical exceptions to the affida-
vits and proceedings before the Police magistrate,
which he contended were not entirely according to
the requirements of the statute, but also contended
that the bail demanded was exorbitant, for a mere
case of misdemeanor, as he alleged this was, in
which the maximum of punishment, if found guil-
ty, was $500 fine, and one year's imprisonment in
the City Prison. The District Attorney, J. R. Whi-
ting, Esq., replied to the remarks of the counsel for
the accused, and dwelt at considerable length on
the infamous notoriety the prisoner had acquired
by her circulars and advertisements, and the vi-
ciousness of the employments in which she had
been for years engaged. He contended it was not
a mere common case of misdemeanor, but one of an
aggravated character with which she was charged;
and that the question as to the bail, was not whe-
ther it was great in proportion to the punishment
for the offence; but whether it was such sufficient
bail as would induce her to stand trial, and not
by forfeiting it, to escape conviction, and punish-
ment.
   He contended that the bail instead of being too
high, was too low; that the proceedings, prelimi-
nary before the magistrate, and up to the time of
her commitment to prison, were correct and con-
formable to the statute; and offered to read the
original affidavit and accompanying papers, to show
the aggravation of the case, and to satisfy the
Judge that the bail was not too high. He said he
should also move to have the amount of bail increas-
ed. Mr. Jordan rejoined to the remarks of the District
Attorney, objecting to the reading of the original
affidavit; and contending, again, that the proceed-
ings in some particulars he named, were not ac-
cording to statute, and that the bail was fixed so high
as to preclude the obtaining of it. But that if the
bail were fixed at a reasonable amount, unexcep-
tionable bail would be given. His Honor Judge
Inglis said he would examine the matter, and de-
cide to-day at 11 o'clock. The District Attorney
said he would require one day's notice as to the
names of the persons, who were to become bail,
that he might have time to inquire into their suffi-
ciency, which His Honor granted. Madame Res-
tel, alias Lohman, was then reconducted to prison.

   M<small>ADAME</small> R<small>ESTELL</small>.—This woman was taken out
of prison on Monday afternoon, and conducted by
Capt. Hyde, the keeper of the prison, to the resi-
dence of Mrs. Purdy, where the District Attorney
and Justice Lownds, with Mr. La Forge, the coun-
sel of Mrs. Purdy, were in attendance to examine
the latter in presence of the accused, in regard to all
the matters with which the prisoner stands charged.
Mrs. Purdy, who is a small, delicate and lovely
looking young woman, with a very innocent expres-
sion of countenance, and a large dark and intelli-
gent eye, was reclining on her bed, unable to rise;
her skin of the purest white, and a slight hectic
flush, the emblem of consumption on <u title="her cheeks">herc heeks</u>.
She was perfectly composed, though very weak, and
reiterated all of her former statement, and something
more, in reply to the various interrogatories pro-
pounded to her by counsel, all of which questions
and answers were carefully taken down by the Dis-
trict Attorney and read over to, and signed by the
complainant. Mrs. Restell, alias Lohman, on be-
ing asked whether she desired counsel, which she
was told she could have, if she wished, drew out a
written document, drawn by her employed counsel
protesting against the examination, and the pro-

out the <u title="slightest">slightests</u> trepidations, or <u title="apparent">appearent</u> con-

rapidly sinking into the arms of death.—<i>Express</i>.

<b>“Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not
			go unpunished.”</b>
   Those who have access to the daily papers of our city,
have observed, ere this, that the notorious Madame Res-
tell, whose vile advertisements have so long disgraced
the press, is at length incarcerated in the “Tombs,”
awaiting her trial, and the sentence of a legal tribunal.
In the providence of God, tangible facts are now before
the public, which seem to prove, beyond a doubt, the deep
guilt of this unhappy woman, and those identified with
her in her work of death.
   Our hearts have long bled over this moral <u title="maelstrom">maelstroom</u>,
and we felt on reading the following presentment, that
<i>prayer</i> has been heard and answered. The fact that the
grand jury have at length taken so firm a stand against
this heroine of licentiousness, and her vile traffic, affords
ground of encouragement that our city is not to be whol-
ly given up, so that it shall be said “Justice is fallen in
our streets, and equity cannot enter.” Let our rulers
once “quit themselves like men,“—and form a patriotic
phalanx for the defence of that “righteousness” that
“exalteth a nation,” and the panders of vice, would not,
as now, walk forth with boldness, and perform their
deeds of darkness year after year, with none to molest
or make them afraid.
   Since the developments of certain facts in this case,
we have noticed that the public press utters a united voice
of condemnation. Those papers too, which have hitherto
stooped so low, as to become the faithful and successful
coadjutors in aiding and abetting these designs of evil,
by giving them publicity in their most offensive and dan-
gerous forms, now attempt to speak as loudly as the rest
in tones of censure? Truly, “out of their own mouths
are they condemned.” We learn from our Visiting Com-
mittee who have visited the prison since the confinement
of Madame Restell, that she appears extremely hardened,

and wholly inaccessible to religious truth or christian
faithfulness. Vigorous efforts are making by a certain
class to release her—but unless there is a radical change
of heart and life, it is to be hoped that her future influ-
ence may not be felt beyond the walls of a prison, and that
there, if no where else, she may be made sensible of the
enormity of her guilt, and led to exercise genuine repen-
tance.

the great number of murders and suicides which
appeared in the papers during the last fall, induced
him, in his usual newspaper reading, to keep a
memorandum of them. He accordingly began
on the first of January last; but cannot have seen
but a small portion of the whole number through-
out the United States. From that date to the first
of April, there have been 74 murders and 63 sui-
cides. Of these, 19 came to sudden death by in-
temperance; 12 by taking laudanum, and other poi-
sons; 7 by hanging themselves; 7 by cutting their
throats; 8 by drowning, and 5 by shooting them-
selves.

company with Henry Green, undertook to break
out of his cell in the 3d tier of the city prison, on
Sunday night. He tore up his blankets and made
of them a handsome rope, and then with an old
case knife and the leg of his bunk, he succeeded in
removing all the small stones in the eastern side of
his cell, in an aperture large enough to pass through,
and was engaged in removing the large stone that
remained, the only bar to his escape, when the
noise aroused Ezra White, who was confined in
the cell underneath him, who alarmed the keepers,
and who running in, stopped the prisoner's opera-
tions, and placed him in double irons, where he will
remain until sentenced.

argued yesterday and is to be decided to-day.
   We would like to know how it is that Justice has slept so
long over the iniquities of this wretched woman, and how the
Grand Jury could now resolve to bring her to account without
a whisper of rebuke her equally guilty <i>accomplices</i> in the
work of corruption and death. Two years ago, we (while
temporarily conducting the New-York Whig.) called public
attention repeatedly to the atrocious and abominable adver-
tisements which were then blazoned in <i>The Sun</i> and Ben-
nett's <i>Herald</i>, urging the <i>Ladies</i> (!) of New-York to avail
themselves of the benefits to be derived from Madame Res-
tell's practices. We remonstrated against the public tolera-
tion of such scandalous and depraving practices and the un-
blushing effrontery of the woman and her coadjutors of the
Sun and Herald in proclaiming their joint iniquity. But no-
body else moved a finger, and the horrible baseness went on
in broad daylight, and flourished. At last, when the woman
had made a fortune, and her newspaper accomplices large
sums by their mutual iniquity, a deluded creature is nearly
murdered, through the joint influences of publications in The
Sun and the practices of Madame R. and behold, Justice is
<i>almost</i> aroused! He opens one eye, reaches out his arm and
grasps one of the culprits, leaving the other untouched! is
this right? Ought they who for base lucre have wilfully
abetted beforehand the crimes of this wretch to escape
wholly unpunished? The public must answer.

   <i>Case of Madame Restell</i>.—Messrs. Morrill and Jordan, in
conformity with notice previously given moved to quash the in-
dictment against Caroline Lohman, alias Madame Restell, Mr.
Morrill read an affidavit of the accused, alleging that the bill
was found against her by the Grand Jury, by virtue of illegal
testimony taken before the Grand Jury in admitting the writ-
ten examination under the oath of Ann Maria Purdy, taken <i>de
bene esse</i> on the 5th inst. pursuant to an order of this Court, be-
fore the Recorder and District Attorney, the accused protesting
<s>????????????????? On the statements put</s> forth on this
affidavit the motion to quash was made.
   The District Attorney opposed this motion, on the ground that
there was nothing in the affidavit to justify to motion to quash.
He contended that an affidavit, on which was based a motion to
quash, must show upon its face that the indictment was defective,
or founded on incomplete, imperfect, and illegal testimony. The
affidavit must state those facts and what they are.
   It is not contended that the indictment is not correctly drawn,
and it does not appear on what evidence the bill was found, whe-
ther on the oath of a Grand Juror, or the testimony in the form
of affidavit, of Mrs. Purdy. The Complaint taken at the Police,
must go before the Grand Jury, in order to show them what the
complaint was and what evidence was necessary to sustain it.
There was nothing in the affidavit to show that the Grand Jury
found the bill on the affidavit or testimony of Mrs. Purdy, or on
what testimony it was found. The complaints of parties must go
before Grand Juries, and there is noting in the affidavit read
on which the Court could entertain this motion.
   Mr. Morrill of Counsel replied and argued the motion at great
length, in favor of quashing the indictment for reasons he ad-
vanced. He cited numerous authorities in favor of his motion,
viz: the case of Smith and Ogden tried more than 30 years ago
before Judge Matthias <u>Talmadge</u>, in the U. S. Court, in which it
is ladi down that a motion to quash an indictment can be sus-
tained on the ground of illegal testimony before the Grand Jury.
Also the case of the Rev. Dr. Dodd, and Leech's Crown Law, p.
155; and other authorities. He contended that Mrs. Purdy
should have been taken before the Grand Jury to testify in the
case, instead of having her affidavit and examination before that
Grand Jury as evidence.
   Mr. Jordan also argued at considerable length in favor of the
motion to quash, and was followed by the District Attorney,
who cited Archibald, criminal law, p. 66, to show that a motion
to quash, must be based on an affidavit setting forth on what ille-
gal testimony the indictment was found, which the present affi-
davit did not; and contended that the affidavit and the allega-
tions therein were not sufficient to found a motion upon, to quash
an indictment. Mr. Jordan rejoined at some length, and argued
the sufficiency of the affidavit.
   The Court, after hearing the arguments, stated that they
would examine the authorities, the affidavit, &c. and decide
upon the motion on Wednesday afternoon, (this day.)

all the circumstances of the case, for a reduction of the

   Recorder—What is the amount of bail?
   Mr. Morrill—Three thousand dollars. He then said it
was impossible to procure bail to such an amount, and as
the offence was but a misdemeanor, punishable on con-
viction but by one <u>years'</u> imprisonment at the most, he
hoped the court would see the propriety of reducing the
amount. In fact so long as so great an amount was re-
quired his client was undergoing an amount of punish-
ment, though not convicted, almost equal to the extreme
punishment that could be awarded if a jury should say
she was guilty of the offence, with which he contended
she was improperly charged.
   The Recorder said, after consultation with his col-
leagues, we are of opinion that the bail is not too much,
and therefore we cannot interfere.
   The Court then proceeded with the trial of petty lar-
ceny cases of no public interest. After which the
Grand Jury came into Court with a number of bills, and

to try, convict and punish Madame Restell, for acts

   Certainly—let her be severely punished—but let
no abortionists escape justice. During <u>Greely</u>'s ca-
reer as an editor he has murdered probably six or
seven young infant newspapers—some penny—some

this by his detestable pills, generally composed of
galvanised New England squashes. The abortions
that this editorial Madame Restell in pantaloons,
hanging with one brace down to the middle of his

wanted to prescribe for the Herald, when it was a
sweet babe, and no doubt he would have killed it
outright, but fortunately he was not allowed to use
his squash pills upon it.
   <u>Greely</u> is now procuring the abortion of a new

   D<small>EATH OF</small> M<small>RS</small>. P<small>URDY</small>.—The known victim of the horri-
ble cupidity, depravity and quackery of Mad. Restell and
her confederates, <i>died</i> of the injuries sustained at the hands
of these creatures, on Wednesday evening—aged about 22
years. Her sufferings for many weeks have been so great
that death was to her as an angel of mercy.
   What should be the punishment of those by whose deprav-
ity this poor victim has been brought to an untimely grave?
Recollect that she was first tempted to apply to the creature
Restell by a servant, who brought her the advertisements of
that fiends in the columns of <i>The Sun</i>. This was long after
the conductors of that paper had been publicly and anxious-
ly remonstrated with and shown the iniquity of publishing
those advertisements. But what cared <i>they</i> for crime or
misery, so long as either could fill their greedy coffers with
gold? No! urge on the work of death! Let crime and sin
riot in the vitals of the community, so that the dollars are
only poured merrily in! And thus, by constant publication
and puffing in <i>The Sun</i>, backed by puffing Editorials in the
<i>Herald</i>, the dreadful trade of this wretch was made to thrive
and gold flowed in streams into her den, and thence to the
pockets of her newspaper accomplices. Must not this
blood-money prove a curse to its receivers?
   Of course, Mrs. Purdy is not by any means the only vic-
tim of these horrible practices. Doubtless may others have
yielded up their lives to her perilous prescriptions, conceal-
ing their shame and their guilt in the darkness of the grave.
What demoniac practices shall be next resorted to, to glut

   <i>Death of Mrs. Purdy</i>.—Mrs. Purdy, the unfortu-
nate victim of the notorious Madame Restell, now in
prison on charge of murder, died yesterday, at the
residence of a relative in New Jersey. Mrs. Purdy
was, two years since, when first she consulted the
fiend Restell, in the bloom of health and beauty.
She was, when she died, but twenty years of age.
This is only an isolated instance of the ruin which
the wretched culprit has practised upon her own spe-
<d>[Col.4]</d>
cies within a few years past. She is now, thank
heaven, safe in the hands of the law, and will not be
suffered to escape, till she and all her coadjutors have
rendered mete sacrifice at the shrine of justice. Sev-
eral persons have recently offered to become bail for
Restell; but upon their being required by the Magis-
trates to justify as to the amount and whereabouts of
their means, they have in every instance <i>backed out</i>.
It requires <i>character</i> as well as means to succeed in
such a cause.

rate either for weal or woe to the prisoner. As she has
the best legal advisers, and they are capable of bringing
all the features of the law to the aid of the defence of their
client, she may be acquitted for want of testimony. On
the other hand if the examination, taken <i>de bene esse</i>, is
got before the jury, then the death of the unhappy lady
must have such an effect on the jury as to insure her
conviction.

			<i>A Visit to the Prison.</i>
   <i>March</i> 29<i>th</i>.—In company with Sister P——, visited,
for the first time, our city prison, which contains at pre-
sent one hundred and forty-three prisoners, mostly males.
I was struck with the youthful appearance of the inmates.
The majority were between the ages of fifteen and thirty;
notwithstanding their crimes have been such as to forfeit
their liberty, they do not generally appear to be hardened
in sin.
   The first cell visited, was occupied by a young girl, ap-
parently not over seventeen years of age. She had been
confined here five months—was associated with a woman
who appeared to be an old offender. They both expressed
much gratitude for the tracts, and were willing to have
prayer offered on their behalf. While we bowed together
before the mercy-seat, they sighed and groaned aloud.
   As we passed from cell to cell, our tracts and papers
secured for us a cordial reception, in every instance save
one. Nearly every hand was extended to receive the lit-
tle messenger of mercy. We had conversation with
most of the prisoners, many of whom were affected even
to tears. With one heart, most of them informed us, that
<i>bad company</i> had brought them here.
   Found one young man destitute of a Bible, whom we
supplied. Met with another, who, during his confine-
ment, had read the Bible through.
   One young man, very intelligent and gentlemanly in his
address, informed us that he had just received his sen-
tence to spend five years in state's prison. This unhappy
youth spoke of his crimes with such deep humility and
brokenness of spirit as would have melted a heart of
stone. I urged upon him the claims of the gospel, and
the consolations of religion, as being adapted even to the
gloomy walls of a prison, and begged him to look to God,
against whom he had sinned for peace and pardon
through the blood of the cross. He replied, that after liv-
ing in sin twenty years, it was hard to bow before the
Lord, and with tears in his eyes requested prayer to be of-
fered for him. Before leaving, he promised to pray for him-
self. May the Lord hear the sighing and groaning of
these poor prisoners, and emancipate them from the
bondage of sin, from the service of Satan, and deliver
them from the prison of hell. We were consoled with
the reflection that these were not endless sighs, nor ever-
lasting groans—that they are still on praying ground, and
a ray of hope beams into these dark abodes.
   In one of the cells visited, we found that “mistress of
abominations,” whose polluted and polluting advertise-
ments have been the means of leading thousands of our
sex to infamy and death. It may be recollected, that the
case of this individual, and her notorious <u title="traffic">triffic</u>, was al-
luded to some time since in the Report of the Visiting
Committee, in the Advocate of August 15th. The prepa-
ration of that Report was the last labor of the kind per-
formed by a beloved member of this Committee, who is
now (if living) on the confines of the grave. We remem-
ber her tears when presenting this Report, and the deep
anguish of her soul, as she inquired, “Cannot something
be done to save our city from such contaminating influ-
ences?” It was benevolence, patriotism, true Christian
feeling, that moved her breast; and, could she see this
woman now in her solitary cell, she would doubtless
“thank God and take courage.” She would not rejoice
in the prospect of her punishment, in itself considered—
but a class of emotions would be awakened, such as may
be felt by the Christian, living or dying, in view of a
greater good, purchased at the expense of a lesser evil.
But to return. Our visit was received by Madam R——
<d>[Col.2]</d>
with great indignation. She remembered a former con-
versation—that my companion had told her of her guilt;
and its inevitable consequences—and her countenance
expressed what was said by one of old, “Art thou come
hither to torment me before the time?” Poor fallen wo-
man—such was not our purpose. We would fain have
pointed her to Him who has said to the truly penitent,
“Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as wool;
though they be red like crimson, they shall be whiter
than snow;” but her heart was harder than the nether
mill-stone. She rejected the tract, saying she had plenty
of good reading, pointing at the same time to a lot of
novels with which she was supplied; and, turning her
back in anger, said, “I will hear nothing from you—I
fear neither God or man, nor care for heaven or hell!”
The keeper remarked that she was visited by hundreds
wearing the garb of gentlemen, and no pains or expense
would probably be spared to screen her from the just
penalty of the law. If she shall be again liberated, and
her career of crime continue unchecked, we know not
what is to become of the morals of our beloved city.

		<m8>Reported for the Courier & Enquirer.</m8>
   <i>Madame Restell</i> alias <i> Lohman</i>.—The counsel of this
woman made a motion in the court of general sessions,
early in the past week, for the quashing of the indict-
ment found against her by the Grand Jury, in which
she is accused of misdemeanor, in having procured
an abortion at the instance of a young married woman
named Purdy, who died on Wednesday last, at
Hackensack, New Jersey, of the effects, it is alleged,
of Madame Restell's mal-practice.
   The motion was made on a legal quibble, and it was
grounded on an affidavit made by Madame Restell, in
which she set forth that she was taken from prison
against her consent to the bedside of Mrs. Purdy,
where Mrs. P. underwent an examination, which was
laid before the Grand Jury, and on which alleged ille-
gal testimony, the indictment was found, and it was
contended that this proceeding being illegal, it vitiated
the whole procedure.
   On Saturday morning, the Court met half past 10
o'clock, and his Honor the Recorder proceeded to
give the decision of the Court on the motion above
<u title="mentioned">mention</u>. He cited a number of cases showing that
the indictment was well founded, and that the affi-
davit of Mrs. Purdy was admissible before the Grand
Jury. Besides, his Honor said it would be highly
improper to quash this indictment or arrest its pro-
ceedings, when there might have been other testi-
mony, parole, oral, or otherwise before them.
   Judge Lynch said he concurred in the opinion of
his Honor.
   Judge Inglis said he did not altogether concur in
that decision, and he then proceeded to read his opin-
ion, in which he held that there were many cases
where the Court not only had the power, but were
bound to quash indictments. He thought, however,
that the Court should be extremely cautious in inter-
fering with the proceedings had before a grand jury.
Another objection to such interference was, that it
would be rendering the Court, to a certain extent, an
examining committee into the action and proceedings
of that body.
   The Recorder said—at the conclusion of Judge In-
glis's opinion, that the Court unanimously concurring,
the motion was denied.
   Madame Restell was then brought out and arraign-
ed—the indictment read to her, to which she pleaded
not guilty. The prisoner was then remanded to
await her trial.

   Judge <u title="Inglis">Ingliss</u> said he concurred generally with the
Recorder, but had some few remarks from cases cited
which he would read to the jury. His principal reason
for declining to quash indictments arose from the fact,
that such a practice had a tendency to make Courts of
Law mere examining committees of the proceedings of
Grand Jurors.
   His Honor then proceeded to read his opinion. And
then the Recorder said that the Court unanimously de-
nied the motion.
   Mr. Morrill said his client was in a very peculiar posi-
tion, she was abused by the press, denied bail, and could
act have a fair trial, he hoped the court would deter the
order to plead.
   The District Attorney said the learned gentleman had
taken time enough, and if he refused to advise his client,
on the motion of pleading the court would advise her to
plead not guilty. After some further conversations the
fair accused was brought into court, looking as <u title="dégagée (free)">degagée</u>
and interesting as possible, and pleaded not guilty.<f>
   <i>False Pretences</i>.—In re William H. Gregory, <u>Roswill</u> L.
Graves, and <u>Roswell</u> Graves, jr., all indicted about three
years since for obtaining monies and securities under
false pretences from Darby Farnham and others in this
city. The Court, with the consent of the District Attor-
ney ordered <i>nolle prosequies</i> to be entered, and the defend-
ants to be discharged.

   ☞ T<small>O</small> T<small>HE</small> P<small>UBLIC</small>.—The course pursued towards
me by a portion of the public press, is one, to say the
least, highly reprehensible, if not criminally culpable,
inasmuch as its effect is to prejudice and poison the pub-
lic mind, by the gross, and I am inclined to believe, ma-
levolent falsehoods and intentional misrepresentations
which are published with all the exaggeration that ma-
lignity can dictate, or imagination conceive. The 'Cou-
rier and Enquirer' has charged me with 'manslaughter,'
and even 'murder,' knowing at the same time that the
charge is misdemeanor, and has also attempted to create
an impression that I had caused the death of the woman
on whose affidavit I have been detained, when it is
notorious that for eighteen months after her alleged
treatment, (in June, 1839,) she had enjoyed sufficient good
health to enable her to attend balls, parties, &c., with late
hours, and exposures incident to such indulgences. Put
even if it were otherwise, is there any justification for
the uncalled for comments indulged in by the Courier &
Enquirer and others, before the party accused is put on
the defence. Justice and common sense requires that no
party shall be adjudged guilty merely on a charge, as
charges are easily made, and may, on trial, prove un-
founded, false, or malicious. It is a violation of those
rights guaranteed to every individual, if not actually a
contempt of court to proceed to adjudge, and treat the
accused at the bar of public opinion, as guilty, before
trial. Such, however has been the course pursued to-
wards me, and I leave it to the public to say whether it
is not in derogation of every maxim of law, justice, de-
cency, or fairness, subversive of the fundamental princi-
ples of our civil institutions.

   J<small>UDGE OF THE</small> C<small>RIMINAL</small> C<small>OURT</small>.—We find in
the Star of last evening the following article:
		[<i>Extract of a letter from Albany.</i>]
   “You stated a few days ago that the nomination of
M. M. Noah, Esq. as Judge of the Court of Sessions,
had been confirmed by the Senate. This is not the
case, and I regret to learn that five Whig Senators
have expressed an unwillingness to concur in the ap-
pointment, not from personal considerations, but from
old political reminiscences. The interest of the King
family has been actively employed against him, and
religious prejudice forms some part of the objections.
I am sorry to see this want of liberality and fairness
to those who have been zealous and efficient in the
Whig ranks, and to whom there are no real grounds
of objection. The three Senators from the First Dis-
trict, who are most interested, will report in favor of
the appointment; still, I think with the other opposi-
tion, he will be rejected.”

   Let it be “rejected,” then; let us understand
what position the democratic portion of the Whig
party holds in the Senate of this State; and if <u title="the"> he</u>
“Kings are to rule over us,” the sooner we know
it the better. If Whigs in the Senate, now the
conflict is over, are pleased to vote against those
who eminently labored to secure the triumph of
the party, because they were in hostile positions
in 1832, there must be a general breaking up of
parties throughout the State. Major Noah was one
among the first who run up the White flag, and left
his early political friends, because he disapproved
the measures of their leaders; and although he
may be entirely indifferent in relation to this small
appointment, not so his numerous republican
friends in the Whig ranks. We cannot afford to
lose any strength either in this city or State—and
lose it, too, through a want of political fidelity
among our own friends. We shall not be alone,
however, in offering Major Noah a cordial welcome
on his return to the columns of the daily press,
should his nomination be rejected; and the result
has been too long delayed, both in reference to
himself and the important business before the
court.—[Star.]

   We do not know how others may be affected by
the annunciation that a person so wholly unquali-
fied by education, acquirements, and character, for
a judicial station, as <i>M. M. Noah</i>, cannot, even by
the force of Executive recommendation, be thrust
upon the bench,—but we confess our own exceed-
ing gratification thereat, and sincerely hope it may
prove true.
   Whether the fact be as set forth in the letter
above quoted—or whether, indeed, it be a genuine
letter, or one concocted in the office of the Star—
(where the aforesaid M. M. Noah still presides, al-
though nominally retired,) we have no means of
judging, for we have no correspondence in Alba-
ny, and have not, and are quite sure no member of
the “family,” to whose agency so much is falsely
imputed, has used, or sought to use, any influence
or interest with the Senate, on the subject of this
nomination, beyond the opposition openly mani-
fested in this paper.
   If, then, there be five Whig Senators who refuse
to make <i>M. M. Noah</i> a judge, it must be put
down to the score, not of their prejudices, nor of
family influence, but of the demerits of the candi-
date. And who indeed that conceives adequately
of the dignity of the judicial station, and knows,
or will suffer himself to be informed of the utter
want of <i>all</i> the requisites for that station in <i>M.
M. Noah</i>, could hesitate about rejecting his nomi-
nation!
   We speak of this person as he is before the
<d>[Col.3]</d>
public. Individually, and in private life, we know
nothing, and seek to know nothing, of him; but as
he has manifested himself in his career before the
world, we say, he is destitute of every single qual-
ification for the bench.
   He is, in the first place, without any legal edu-
cation or knowledge. True, that in times past,
to the infinite discredit of the Supreme Court
of this State, he was, from the moral <u title="weakness">weakess</u> that
cannot say No to importunity, or from the sugges-
tions of <i>party</i> associations, admitted, by special
favor, a Counsellor of the Court—but, even the
Supreme Court cannot, by its <i>fiat</i>, convert igno-
rance into knowledge, or flippancy into eloquence.
   He is without principle, if truth be the corner-
stone thereof. He is the author of, and has habitu-
ally practised upon, the doctrine that “all is fair
in politics”—and he never does, and for the many
years that we have been witnesses of his editorial
career, never did, seem to consider truth as a ne-
cessary element of character or rule of conduct.
   Merit, however, is claimed for him, that he aban-
doned his party to join the opponents. He came over
to the opposition, only after, to use his own lan-
guage, “the crust that had been thrown to him
was withdrawn before it was eaten.” He had been
made Surveyor of the Port by General Jackson,
but found he could not be re-appointed at the ex-
piration of the term.
   He accordingly made a merit of retiring, and
immediately commenced a paper professedly for
the support of Gen. Jackson's Administration, but
in fact to oppose it. He has abused and praised,
supported and deserted, all parties, and unless ru-
mor belie him much, was prepared, in the pinch of
last year's struggle, again to desert and go back to
his old associates.
   Finally, he was the author of the system of drag-
ging into his newspaper the private affairs and the
family connections of those whom he selected for
attack, and first opened the door to that system
of private slander which is improved, and only a
little improved, from the <u title="= ancient">antient</u> National Advo-
cate, by the present New York Herald, whose edi-
tor learned his trade of slander in the office of the
National Advocate.
   We have left bound to say thus much, because
we look upon the article in last evening's paper
as designed—by the intimation, especially at the
close, that M. M. Noah intended to go
back to the public press,—to operate as a
threat of future vengeance against all those
Senators who may oppose his nomination; and we
desire that they should know that there is one press
here, at any rate, what will applaud moral courage,
and has no misgivings about calling a knave a
knave, when the public interest may require it to
be done.
   We shall, moreover, as we are falsely charged
with interfering with this matter, make a point of
transmitting this paper to every Senator, that it
may at least be known what our views are as to
this nomination.

<d>[Col.4]</d>
   T<small>HE</small> T<small>RIBUNE</small>.—This is the name of a new
penny paper, which bids fair, we have great satis-
faction in believing, to counteract, in part at least,
the unmitigated evil of its more licentious con-
temporaries.
   The Editor, Mr. Greeley, has talents, know-
ledge, and industry, under the guidance of sound
morals. He has also large experience as an Edi-
tor, and a conscientious sense of the dignity of the
vocation.
   The effect of the existing penny press is, as we
have said above, one of almost unmixed evil. It
panders to the worst passions, and lives upon the
fears, the credulity, and the crimes of the commu-
nity.
   In proper hands, and under due moral restraints,
the minor press could be made as mighty for good
as now, under other guidance, it is for mischief. We
trust and believe the Tribune will prove to be such
an ally in the cause of principle, political and
moral.
   It is Whig in its doctrines; and already, we are
told by the Editor, in only third week of its
existence, it prints some 5500 copies.
   We trust it will go on prospering.

		TO THE PUBLIC
   When, at the solicitation of many ardent Whigs, we com-

Whig in character and avowedly to counteract the subtle but
deadly venom which <i>The Sun</i> is now and has for years been
silently infusing into the veins of the body politic, we did not

to state. Two years ago, the ostensible publisher of <i>The
Tattler</i> was publishing a cheap Whig paper, and we for a
short time had partial charge of its Editorial columns. We
then spoke of The Sun precisely as we now do, exposing the
base hypocrisy of its pretensions to independence while in
truth it was the veriest self of Loco-Focoism, refuting its
jesuitical attacks on the Whig cause, and denouncing the hor-
rible prostitution of its advertising columns to the blazoning
of Mrs. Restell's and other leprous advertisements—Madam
Restell's laboratory being then in full operation. In short,
we were then guilty of just such “prevarication,” “false-
hood,” “tergiversation,” etc., as has now sunk us to the rank
of “ex-gentleman” in the eyes of 162 Nassau; but we wrote
the articles in that very office, and they were published in the
<i>New-York Whig</i>. Need we say more?

MENTS IN THE</small> M<small>ORALS OF</small> P<small>OLITICS</small>.—Scarcely has the
famous “Glentworth case” ceased to be uppermost
in the public mind, when we are again to be pre-
sented with an entirely new illustration of the beau-
ties of “paper snatching” and the morals of Wall
street editors.
   The party accused, in the present instance, of lay-
ing violent hands upon private papers, is no less an
individual than Webb of the “Courier and En-
quirer,” and the party complainant is or was in the
editorial department of the “New World”—Epes
<u title="Sargent ?">Sargeant</u>
   It appears that these two personages, being in
Washington upon similar business, the one to ob-
tain the Post Office in this city, and the other a for-
eign appointment, with congenial appetites to feed
from the public crib, had taken a parlor in common.
But this friendship was not destined to last long, for
Webb soon suspected his friend of not being entire-
ly favorable to his desired appointment, and forth-
with determined to ruin him with those in authority.
Accordingly, unknown to his friend, he lays violent
hands upon his private papers, and extracts there-
from certain “memoranda,” or “notanda,” in which
were used the words “Webster dynasty.” These
<u title="too">t  </u> scrupulous and conscientious editor of the “Cou-
rier” exhibits about to prove his friend <u>Sargeant</u> in
the “Clay interest.” The two return to New York
with disappointed hopes and soured tempers, where
poor <u>Sargeant</u> learns from the new Collector, at the
dancing party given by M. H. Grinnell, the cause of
the failure of his brightest hopes. The scene here
opens, and in the course of a long epistolary corres-
pondence (somewhat spiced) these facts are admit-
ted on the part of Webb:—
   1st. That he took the private papers of his friend.
   2d. That he exhibited them about, to injure him in
a certain quarter.
   3d. That he finally destroyed them, thus cutting
off every explanation or interpretation that the
words might be made to import.
   Here then, is a beautiful illustration of the “Cour-
ier's” regard for the “private papers of a citizen.” No
paper was so loud and noisy in its denunciation of
Recorder Morris,<u>”</u> but he claimed to proceed as a
magistrate, and to act by judicial right. By what au-
thority does the “Courier” pretend to act when he
seizes the private papers of his friend, and without
his knowledge, uses them to his detriment? The
“Courier” should forever remain silent on the sub-
ject of the inviolability of private papers, when con-
victed of the offence in its worst possible form. It
presented us, in the case of Recorder Morris, with a
beautiful theory on this subject, and it has now ex-
hibited to the public a forcible example of its own
practice. As the editor of the “Courier” is given to
writing learnedly on the subject of law, he will no
doubt be able to sustain himself upon some English
reported case—in which the point is conceded that
any person has the right to search the private port-
folio of his friends, seize his private papers, and use
them as he may see fit.
   The public will soon be presented with the details
of this interesting case. The correspondence ought
to be published. Come Epes, out with it.

   A<small>PPOINTMENT OF</small> J<small>UDGE</small> N<small>OAH</small>.—So the appoint-

is come at last. Better late than never. The violent
and disgraceful attack upon Noah, set on foot and
perpetrated by the “King family,” has operated upon
the Senate like a shock of electricity in his favor.
<i>Apropos</i>—This “King concern” wants some spring
medicine to set them on their legs. We must give
them a dose or two, price two pence a piece. They
have been getting rather impudent of late, and want
something to cool them down to decency at least.
The idea that a paltry set of Wall street stock-job-
bers should regulate stocks, exchanges, morals, le-
gislature, law, and appointments to office, is prepos-
terous enough.
   Let Judge Noah take his seat and now to business.

   <i>Trial of Ezra White</i>.—The Court room was crow-
ded to excess in the morning, in the expectation that
the trial of this man would be called on.
   The District Attorney informed the Court that he
was not prepared to proceed, as the principal witness
for the prosecution had left the city; but he had been
informed by his wife that he was expected hourly.
   Mr. Graham, Counsel for the prisoner, said that if
a motion was to be made for a postponement, he
should like to have the cause proceed, and to be heard
in argument against the motion.
   The District Attorney—“I shall not move for a
postponement, but if not prepared, shall not move it
on.”
   Mr. Graham—“Then I beg to inform the District
Attorney, that unless the case be called during the
present term, I shall at its expiration, move the Court
for the discharge of the prisoner.”
   Mr. Whiting said that he should call the case on
Monday morning, if the witness had returned by that
time, and the prisoner was remanded.
   We learn that the absent witness is Wright, the
watchman, upon whose testimony alone the prisoner
can be convicted, and without which White will not
be put on his trial. The probability therefore is, that
he will be discharged by the Court.

   <i>Madame Restell</i>.—This woman was brought before the Re-
corder on Tuesday evening, by virtue of a writ of habeas cor-
pus, sued out by her acting counsel, P. B. Manchester, Esq. for
the purpose of having her admitted to bail in $3,000. A man
named <u>Selden Brainerd</u>, formerly of Boston, who has transacted
a pretty large business in the bailing line to the amount, as is
stated of some thousands of dollars, offered himself as bail; and,
justifying to the possession of twice the amount of bail demanded,
he was received as bail, and Madame Restell was discharged
from custody. Whether the bail is available, and whether Mrs.
Restell alias Lohman will appear and be tried for the offence
with which she is charged, remains to be seen and known.

   <i>Restell at large</i>.—The notorious Madame Restell
was on Tuesday evening set at liberty by the Recor-
der. She produced the requisite security in the per-
sons of her husband (?) Charles Lohman, and <u><a href="http://archive.org/details/supplementtogene00brai" title="See page 165">Selden
Braynard</a></u>, each of whom justified in the amount of
$3000 each, in addition to which she deposited $3000
in cash subject to the order of the proper authorities,
in the event of a forfeiture of her recognizance. We
understood yesterday that she had left the city on a
short tour into the country, for the benefit of her
health.

<d>[Col.4]</d>
		<m8>Reported for the Courier & Enquirer.</m8>
	COURT OF OYER AND TERMINER.
		Before Judge Edwards.
   <i>Trial of White—A Jury <u title="Empanelled">Empannelled</u></i>.—The trial
of Ezra White for the murder of Peter Fitzpatrick,
commenced yesterday morning.
   Hon. Mr. Hall, Attorney General and J. R. Whit-
ing, Esq., District Attorney, appeared for the prose-
cution, and Messrs. David Graham and Wright
Hawkes, appeared as counsel for prisoner.
   At the opening of the court White was brought in
and placed at the bar. He wore and retained
throughout the day, the same fixed indifferent ex-
pression of countenance, which he has ever done
since his arrest. He appears in excellent health, and
much improved in appearance since his previous
trial. His skin which was then sallow, is now of an
alabaster whiteness, and forms a curious contrast
with his long dark straight hair, which is parted and
combed down on either side of his face; his eyes are
dark and of sparkling brightness. It is, however,
difficult to catch a glance from his eyes; as he sits
almost perpetually gazing, or staring on vacancy, ap-
parently unconscious of all which passes around him.
Once & once only during yesterday, was there any per-
ceptible change in the <u>prisoners</u> countenance; a juror
was called up and being required to swear, he persist-
ed for some time in “kissing the book” previous to
taking the oath. The ludicrousness of the circum-
stance, caused a general laugh throughout the court
room, and a kind of sympathetic smile was seen to
cross the countenance of White.
   The Clerk commenced calling the Jury at about
half-past 10 o'clock. Before 2 o'clock, the original
panel of 84, and the additional panel of 200, ordered
the day previous, had become exhausted, and but
seven <i>unprejudiced</i> jurors were found out of the
whole number. Under the law, in addition to a num-
ber specified by order of the Court, no more jurors
could be summoned on a panel, then the number
deficient on the jury to be formed; this number,
then was six; and the Sheriff was compelled to
make a return of a summons of six jurors; and this
tedious process was kept up through the whole day,
till eight o'clock last evening, when a full jury was
obtained. The following are the names of the jury:
Hiram Bartlett, Foreman; Alanson See, Ebenezer B.
White, Albert Beach, Samuel M. Wiseman, George
Bruce, George H. Young, John G. Snow, Joseph
Carlisle, George Lansing, Lafayette Boley, and Archi-
bald C. Reynolds.
   Between 400 and 500 jurors and <i>talesmen</i> were sum-
moned. 244 were challenged for cause, and but 18
peremptorily. 54 were excused by the Court, and of
the number summoned, those not above enumerated
failed to appear.
   The prisoner and jury were required to rise and
listen to the reading of the indictment; at the con-
clusion of which, the jury were locked up for the
night, White was remanded, and the Court to this
morning at 9 o'clock adjourned.
   ☞ The Counsel request all the witnesses to be
punctual in their attendance this morning, as the ex-
amination of witnesses will commence at 9 o'clock
precisely.

	...
   William H. Wright sworn on behalf of the prose-
cution, examined by the District Attorney.—I reside
at 62 Suffolk street, blacksmith by trade. At the
time of this fray, I was one of the city watchmen. I
was a chance man. It was on the night of the 13th
of <u>February</u>, 1839, as near as I can recollect. My
post was bounded from Pitt street, Grand street,
from there to Columbia; from there to Broome, and
back to Pitt street. <u>Gaffrey</u>'s house was on the
south east corner of Broome and <u title="Willett">Willer</u> street. (The
witness describes the house.) There is a door open-
ing in each street. I think I came on at 12 o'clock
that night. There was a dance at <u>Gaffrey</u>'s house;
there were many persons going from and coming to
the house; they seemed lively at first, and more
lively at last. It was quite in the street; there was
no quarrelling in the house; I was by the house a
number of times; the noise was the noise of jollity,
not of quarrelling. There was nothing more there
than the noise usually heard on Saturday nights. <u>I
I</u> came to the corner between one and two, as I heard
a noise there. The door up <u title="Willett">Willet</u> street was open,
and there appeared to be trouble there. There
were two or three on the stoop, as near the door as
they could stand. As I stepped on the <u title="stoop">stoup</u>, they
were in struggle as it seemed, with those inside.
<u>Samuel</u> Stark jumped off the stoop; two more stood,
the one inside, the other in the door fighting. One
inside seemed trying to push the other out, to the
best of my recollection. As soon as I stepped up, I
pushed the one on the stoop off, and the other came
out. I shut <u>Gaffrey</u>'s door; I told them to keep the
door shut, and then wheeled on through my walk.
I know three of them; I knew them by sight; one
was <u>Joseph</u> Stark, Ezra White and <u>Richard</u> Stark.
I have heard their names since; I went up to Joseph
Stark, advised him to go away, for the men inside
were in liquor, Joseph Stark said to me, <u id="Herald-1841-05-14-Ezra-Knock-Down">“Wright,
go away, I'll soon knock down some of them.”</u> I
told him that if he did not go away immediately, I
would rattle for assistance, and take him to the
watchhouse. At this time both the doors of <u>Gaf-
frey</u>'s house were shut. As I spoke, we stood near
the corner of the street; Joseph Stark went on. The
other young men stood very near to the corner.
(The witness here describes from a diagram the ex-
act situation.)
   Stark stood at the near corner of Broome and Wil-
lett; he was a little way below the house. The
walk was about six feet, and he was about the cen-
tre. <u>Lemuel</u> Stark was a little round the corner in
Broome Street, and White stood near him, I spoke
loud to Joseph; the others could hear; they were
about eight or nine feet from Joseph Stark. The
stoop went round the house; it was about a step up.
I do not remember any thing of it; it was boards, I
believe. The floor of the store went up about a foot
higher, as near as I could judge. After speaking to
Joseph Stark, I went up Willett street; he went to-
wards the rest of them; as I went I heard some one
go up on the stoop; I looked round, and saw Ezra
White with his hand upon the door; that was the
Willett street door; the two doors lock together on
a post; on seeing that I started for the door, and
White let go of it. One man stood with his back
to the Broome street door, very near to the post.
White made motions with his hand; he struck the
man some where about here (the abdomen); there
was a rush made by those inside; the second man
he struck pitched out head first, and I caught him
about the waist in my hands. I think there was se-
ven or eight crowding to get out; I let the man fall,
and gave the alarm rattle. Two or three watch-
men came; Mr. Loder was one, and I don't remem-
ber the name of the other. When I gave the alarm,
the four ran in every direction; White turned the
Broome street corner, and ran down the street to-
wards the river. I had a watchman's cap on; it
was a star light night; it strikes me that there was
some snow in the gutters, but I am not positive; I
do not remember whether it was cold; I think I had
an overcoat on; I think it froze a little during the
night. When the other watchmen came up, we
went into the house. The man who had fallen was
taken up by the people of the house, and was car-
ried in; I cannot tell whether he walked in on his
feet, or was carried in; I cannot say whether the
doors of the store were immediately closed or not.
The <u>watchman</u> came up directly after the alarm.
When I went in, one man was bleeding from the
forehead, and another one lay on the ground, bleed-
ing from the abdomen. I did not hear the man on
the floor speak; there was a good deal of excite-
ment. There was a third man, who I understood
was stabbed, and was carried away. Some one went
for a doctor; I staid there an hour, or an hour and a
half, I cannot say positively; I went away, and re-
turned in the morning; the man on the floor was not
dead when I left; when I went in the morning, I
found the man there dead; I heard his name that
night, but had not heard it before, they called him
Peter Fitzpatrick. At the time I saw this press at
the door, it strikes me that White had something in
his hand, but I cannot positively swear whether he
had or not; my impression is that he had, but my
memory is so poor that I <u>could swear</u> it. There
was a lamp lighted, and hanging over the counter.
I believe there was another light there; there was
a street lamp a little farther off. I saw the wound
when the Coroner came. I did not see it before.—
It was near the abdomen. I cannot say what it
was. I think it was a knife, or something of that
kind. I think it must have been a knife, but I cannot
swear positively.
   Cross-examined by Mr. Graham.—At that time I
was a chanceman. I used to average 3 or 4 nights
in a pay—that is, in a fortnight. Chancemen go to
occupy the place of some watchmen, who, for some
reason, is absent. I cannot tell how often I have
been examined; I think four or five times—once be-
fore the Coroner, once before the Police Justice,
once before the Grand Jury, and once upon the first
trial of this case. The Coroner heard me twice.
This is the sixth examination. I have at each ex-
amination given the same account as I now give, to
the best of my knowledge. On that night I was ab-
sent from 9 to 12. I had been there in the fore part
of the evening. The inmates of the house were
then pretty lively; they were dancing. I did not
see any one come out or go in there. I cannot
say that they were excited with liquor. There might
have been as many as 20. I saw them through a
small, square window. I heard them dancing.
   When I returned at twelve, they were not making
any more noise than is usual with them. I had
been past once, before the time when I saw White
there. I think I saw some young men standing near
the house before I came round at one or two. I
neither saw them go in <u>or</u> come out of the house.
They did not say anything; I do not think I should
know their faces. When I came up, there was
Lemuel Stark and Joseph and Ezra White standing.
<u>Gaffrey</u>'s friends seemed following them, White and
others, out of the house, <u>Gaffrey</u> stood right before
the door, and pushed the men inside back; they
were making towards the door; I do not think that
either of the three came out; as I stepped on to
the stoop, they stepped off. When White had hold
of the knob of the door, the others rushed up to his
assistance. The door opens out; he opened it with
his left hand. I was ten or twelve feet distant
from the door.
   [The witness was here severely cross-examined
as to his ability to see, from his situation, any blow
struck by Ezra White in the interior.]
   I stood in the middle of the side walk, up Willett
street. The three young men, with the prisoner,
rushed up, and commenced striking and fighting
the inmates, as soon as White had opened the door.
I had never seen Fitzpatrick before. After Fitzpa-
trick came out, the crowd followed; I thought he
was pushed out by the crowd inside; he was picked
up, and carried inside; I did not see him after he
was taken in, until I saw the man lying on the floor;
I did not see the man's face so as to recognise him
again.
   By the Court—I supposed <u>Delaney</u> to have been
the man who was first struck by the door. I never
saw him and Fitzpatrick together.
   By Mr. Graham—When I went in, nothing par-
ticular transpired that I recollect. I heard some re-
marks like this from the inmates, “Watchman!
watchman! keep out, this is only a family concern.”
It was said by some of <u>Gaffrey</u>'s friends; there was
something said like this, “Go out, go out! you are
not wanted here.” I did not go out immediately.
   Mr. Graham read, from the evidence presented on
the former trial, that part where witness deposed
that he immediately went out.
   Witness—If I said so, it was the truth; I do not
recollect the circumstance now.
   Mr. Graham again read from report of the former
trial, where witness says, I can't say that I saw any
body carried into the house.
<d>[Col.4]</d>
   Witness—If it is so there, I suppose that is the
way I <u title="testified">tesified</u>.
   Mr. Graham again reads. Witness says that is
correct.
   Witness—Last week I was in Rochester; I had
business there; I did not know the trial was coming
on. When this case was tried before, I went away;
I had business away; I was back just in time to be
examined. When we went into the house, there
was a good deal of loud talking. The people were
rushing out in a rage, using some rash talk, I don't
know what.
   Mr. Graham proposes to ask the witness whether
he made certain statements before Justice Taylor.
Objected to by the District Attorney. Objection
overruled.
   Witness—I stated before Justice Taylor that I had
walked ten or twelve feet along Willett street; that
I saw White strike at some person inside with some-
thing which I saw glisten, but could not say whe-
ther it was a knife or dirk; that several men imme-
diately rushed out after, the first blow was struck by
White; that White struck again, and jumped round
the corner striking right and left. I also stated that
I did not see White seized by any one from the
house. The men rushed out of the door when this
man fell.
   Direct examination resumed.—I cannot say that I
have any distinct recollection as to whether the
thing that was in his hand glistened. I should not
like to say positively. Lemuel Stark is a lame man
—he limps. I do not remember to have heard
White say any thing when he thrust his hand in at
the door. The man who was stabbed in the abdo-
men was the second man. As the man who fell came
out of the house, I saw Ezra White strike him some-
where about the head. I thought the man was injured
when he fell. Whether it was this man, or some one
else, I cannot tell. As soon as he was struck the
rush pushed him out. He was hurt, I should think,
from the blow, not from his fall. He did not fall
head-foremost on the pavement. I think I heard
some one say “I am stabbed;” but whether it was
the man who fell or not, I cannot say. I only saw
one man on the floor; he was laying on his back,
with a pillow <u>on</u> the head. The other man had
something round his head. I saw White strike the
man who fell. I saw no one else struck.
   Cross-examination resumed.—I would not like to
swear now that I saw a weapon gleaming. I think
when the other watchmen came up I stated that
some one had been stabbed. I am not certain about
it. I do not recollect my reason for going out of the
house when the inmates told me.
   Mr. Graham.—Then you left the house, after you
knew some one had been stabbed? You would have
left a house even if you knew a murder had been
committed?
   Mr. Whiting.—He doesn't say so—a man might
be stabbed without being killed.
   The examination of the witness here closed, hav-
ing occupied a space of three hours and a half.
   Mr. Graham here read Wright's deposition before
Justice Taylor.
   Charles Fitzpatrick, a physician, residing at 82
Sheriff street, attended at Gaffney's—he was sent
for, and saw Fitzpatrick. He found the wound on
the lower part of the abdomen. When he saw the
man, he was in a dying state, incapable of <u title="deglutition">delutition</u>.
The wound seemed to have been inflicted by an
edged instrument; he thinks it was such a wound as
would be likely to produce death. On the cross-ex-
amination, witness stated, that he was not the first
physician called in; he did not probe the wound; it
extended upwards, from the bottom; death from
such a wound takes place from the effusion of blood.
I think I got there, to the best of my recollection,
between 12 and 1 o'clock.
   Walter <u title="Pugsley (elsewhere)">Payley</u> is a physician and surgeon. He
was called to Gaffney's house between two and three
—saw Fitzpatrick lying on his back, with something
under his head, naked, all but the cloth that was over
him. The wound was in the groin. I made the ex-
amination before Dr. Fitzpatrick. I inserted my fin-
ger into the wound, and I do not think that was cal-
culated to give a different direction to the wound. I
administered some stimuli.
   From the character of the wound, I should think
it unlikely he would live for two hours. The wound
of <u>Delany</u> was just above the navel. I should have
considered it a dangerous cut.
   Cross-examined.—I do not think any artery was
wounded in Fitzpatrick; it seemed to be venous
blood. The man did not bleed when I left. I left
orders for the pressure to be continued. I think if
proper stimuli had been supplied, and he had been
attended to, his life might have been saved. There
was some coagulated blood in the wound. The next
thing I heard of the man was that, he was dead.—
That wound could not have been given by a man
standing by the door and stabbing upwards. If a man
was standing a little lower, it would be still more im-
possible.
   Direct examination resumed—I thought there was
blood and life enough in the man to make it possi-
ble that he might be saved. The extremities were
cold. I judged from the man's appearance that he
had been intoxicated. I understood that he was
drunk, or crazy; so the man said who kept the
house. Gaffney said that there were two men who
did the mischief; a short man and a tall one.
   Christopher Dunlady deposed that he was at Gaff-
ney's house on the night. It was on the 13th of <u>Ja-
nuary</u>, I think. I went there about 9 o'clock; Gaff-
ney invited me there; I came out about 1 o'clock. I
heard them say that people were outside. Fitzpa-
trick came in and said he had a desperate kick or
wound in the groin. He threw himself across me,
and I stretched him on the floor.
   He had refused to drink awhile before. After he
was stabbed, he mentioned my name and his wife's.
There were three or four boys there in the fore part
of the evening, but they behaved themselves peace-
ably. I did not see White to know him.
   Cross-examined.—There were about twenty per-
sons at Gaffney's; I saw a man all besmeared with
blood, come in after Fitzpatrick; it was about half-
past two or three o'clock when Fitzpatrick came in;
I saw some persons drinking at the counter; we
drank gin; I saw no one drink there; he was stand-
ing on his feet, his hands over where the wound was;
he was dressed in a frock coat; the wound went
through all.
   Edward Durham, another witness, testified as to
the nature of the company at Gaffney's. He found
a quarrel going on. <u title="There">there</u> was a man with Fitzpa-
trick a little in the door; I took hold of him, and
said they should have no muss there. The landlord
came up; I heard a <u title="scuffle">scufflle</u> at the door, and the
landlord finally got it shut; as I went to the door,
Fitzpatrick passed me by; Gaffney got the door shut,
and it was pulled open by some one; at the time
Fitzpatrick went out, several more went out as far
as the threshold. I was going when Fitzpatrick
passed me by; I was before on the point of going
into the house, when the man stabbed me; when
Fitzpatrick passed me by, he was stooping, as if he
had been badly hurt; I believe Fitzpatrick went out
of his own accord; there were two others <u>cut</u>; I
think when I was stabbed, I was outside of the door
on the stoop. I do not know who struck me.
   Cross-examined—Some of the men drank freely;
the bar was open, and there was frequently liquor
brought into the back room; the Willett street door
was open when Fitzpatrick went towards it, to go
out; as I turned to go in, I saw Fitzpatrick, and I
received my stab; there was no person carrying
Fitzpatrick in. I did not see him either stabbed or
struck; I am distinct in my recollection that I saw
Fitzpatrick go out; I did not see anybody help him;
he moaned when he passed me; I cannot tell whe-
ther the door was opened from the outside or
inside; it was wide open; it is my opinion that a
few more went out at the time that Fitzpatrick did.
   At this point of the case the Court took a recess.
   The foregoing are all the material points elicited
on the part of the prosecution. Only two witnesses
were called for the defence.
   The counsel commenced summing up about 8
o'clock, and at midnight the case went to the jury.

			<b>City Intelligence.</b>
	...
   M<small>ADAME</small> R<small>ESTELL</small>.—Some very erroneous reports
have been circulated respecting the bail of this cele-
brated feminine <u title="savant">savan</u>. We have obtained a sight
of the office documents connected with her libera-
tion, and collected therefrom the following facts:—
   The accused was brought before the Recorder on
Friday, for the purpose of tendering bail. Her coun-
sel prepared to deposite in the hands of the Record-
er, or the Clerk of the Court, or the Chamberlain of
the city, the sum of $3,000, the same to become for-
feit to the people, if Caroline Lohman did not ap-
pear to take her trial. His Honor said that he had
great doubts of the legality of such a procedure, and
that he should not consent to receive such a depo-
site, or to sanction it on the part of others.
   Mr. Jordan, the counsel for Madame Restell, then
proposed that the money should be placed in the
hands of <u>Thomas L. Braynard</u>, of No. 7 Hammond
street, who should assign the same to him, and that
he, Mr. Jordan, should give a certificate of such as-
signment to the Recorder. The same sum to be-
come forfeit to the people if Caroline Lohman did
not appear to take her trial.
   The arrangement was deemed bo be satisfactory,
and the Recorder then made the two sureties justi-
fy in the sum of $<u>6</u>,000 each. The names attached
to the bail bond are <u>Thomas L. Braynard</u>, of No.7
Hammond street, and Charles Lohman, of 148
Greenwich street.
   By another document attached to the assignment,
it would appear that <u>Braynard</u> named the sum of
$10 as his fee for this fair business transaction.

with the murder of Peter Fitzpatrick, on the night
of the 13th of February, 1839, was brought to a
close yesterday afternoon about three o'clock. The
presiding judge then delivered his charge, and the
jury retired. After being out several hours, the
jury returned into court, stating that they could
not agree upon a verdict and asking to be dis-
charged. They were remanded to their room by
the court, where they remained until about one
o'clock, when they came to an agreement as to
their verdict. It was announced to the court as
follows: “Manslaughter in the third degree, and
unanimously recommending the prisoner to the

were Willis Hall, Attorney General, and J. R.
Whiting, District Attorney, for the people; David

strayed away from the vessel, when a man named James Coch-

attended, and to whom <u title="Galway (later)">Galloway</u> stated he was sick and wished
to lie down, which he was suffered to do. He then stated to
Mrs. Gill that he had been robbed, who told her husband of it
when he returned. Cochrane, who pretended to be the friend
of Galloway, then wished Gill to examine a sore he said he had
on his side, and Gill, in so doing, discovered something under
Cochrane's arm, which, on taking it out, proved to be the same
$14 Galloway had lost, and was identified by means of the let-

   “THE MORAL CHARACTER OF NEW-YORK.”
   If the Father of Evil ever laughs, as he has been said to
do, at the 'fantastic tricks' of his practiced and adroit auxil-
iaries, he certainly must have enjoyed himself in looking over
the leading article in <i>The Sun</i> yesterday morning. That
depraved and filthy sheet, which has forced itself into a wide
circulation by systematically pandering to the lowest appe-
tites and most perverted tastes of the community—which has
never missed an opportunity to excite and profit by the fools'
wonder which gloats over accounts of monstrous births, the
chewing of snakes, the galvanizing into life of dead malefac-
tors, and every thing else hideous, revolting and horrible—
that paper which has built its fortune upon publishing trials
for procuring abortion, loathsome details of obscene vice, and
every thing calculated to stimulate the most prurient cravings
for garbage—that paper, the Sun, actually has the effrontery
to congratulate the citizens of New-York on a signal improve-
ment in their morals, and to take to <i>itself</i> the credit of pro-
ducing it! Where can this impudence find a parallel?
   The Sun graciously admits the Public and Sunday Schools
of our City, its Bible and Tract Societies, &c. to a secondary
partnership with <i>itself</i> in producing this beneficent change!—
but it arrogates the lion's share of the glory. We suspect
these Schools and Societies will not appreciate the honor in-
tended them. “To the cheap and independent press”—
[meaning itself, for it has never allowed any other, except
possibly the Herald, to possess either independence or merit]
—“belongs the <i>highest honor</i> in this good work.”!!!
   We are curious to know whether the Sunday Schools and
Bible Societies, which are so graciously admitted to the po-
sition of humble but useful auxiliaries of The Sun in the great
work of moral reformation, are to take a share in the credit
of introducing Madame Restell so favorably and <u title="thoroughly">thorougly</u> to
the public as The Sun through the last two years has done,
and of the other fearfully demoralizing advertisements and
puffs which it has so constantly and profusely vomited upon
the community. According to The Sun's published code of
morality, the Editors and Publisher of that sheet are no whit
responsible for the indecency or depravity of any article in
their columns, if they are only <i>paid for</i> inserting it; so we
presume the credit of this portion of their missionary labors
will not be worth sharing.

   C<small>OURT OF</small> O<small>YER AND</small> T<small>ERMINER</small>.—Before Judge Edwards
adn Aldermen Benson and Purdy.
   <i>Sentence of Ezra White</i>.—This prisoner was brought into
Court on Saturday morning to receive sentence, which the Dis-
trict Attorney moved should then be passed upon him. He ap-
peared quite composed and apparently indifferent to the proceed-
ing of the Court in his case; and, when asked what he had to
say why the judgement of the law should not be pronounced
against him, replied, “Nothing.”
   Judge Edwards then addressed the prisoner at considerable
length, and stated in substance that, after a fair and impartial
trial, he had been convicted of the crime of manslaughter in the
3d degree in causing the death of Peter Fitzpatrick by stabbing.
Three others (he continued) had been stabbed and wounded also
on the same occasion, and doubtless by the hand of the prisoner.
Fitzpatrick, the victim of the prisoner's violence, was now <u tittle="mouldering">mould-
dering</u> in his grave, and his wife and children were thrown upon
the cold charities of an unfeeling world, and left, perhaps, in a
state of great destitution by his means. His Honor then spoke
of the habits and mode of life of the prisoner and his compan-
ions, who had indulged in vicious courses and led lives of dis-
order and depravity, that had resulted in the death of one mur-
dered man. He said, to deter those companions from their per-
sistance in such courses the law would exert its authority and
punish to the utmost extent allowed, notwithstanding the recom-
mendation to mercy of the jury. The Court said they could see
no mitigation circumstances in the case, and accordingly sen-
tenced the prisoner to 4 years' imprisonment at hard labor in the
State Prison at Sing Sing. He was then remanded to prison,
and the Court adjourned for the term.

<d>[Col.5]</d>
			<b>Oyer and Terminer.</b>
Before Judge Edwards, and Aldermen Benson and Purdy.
   M<small>AY</small> 22.—<i>Sentence of Ezra White</i>.—This being the last
day of the term, Ezra White was brought into court to
receive sentence for occasioning the death of Peter Fitz-
patrick, which the jury on the second trial reduced to
manslaughter in the third degree, accompanied with a
recommendation to mercy. White remained in the same
state of unconcern which has ever characterized him,
since the commission of the atrocity, for which he has
gained such notoriety; but his bloodless countenance
would occasionally brighten when receiving the cares-
ses of his counsel, Mr. Alderman Graham. Having been
placed at the bar,
   The District Attorney called for the judgement of the
Court and of the law upon the convicted homicide.
   The Clerk, in the prescribed form, asked the prisoner
what he had to say why judgment should not be pro-
nounced upon him according to law? and
   The Prisoner, bowing to the Court, replied “Nothing.”
   Judge Edwards then passed the sentence of the Court
in the following terms:—
   E<small>ZRA</small> W<small>HITE</small>,—You have been convicted of manslaugh-
ter, in causing the death of Peter Fitzpatrick, and in the
circumstances of that case the court can discover no-
thing of a mitigating character. It appears that at the
time you approached him, and gave him the mortal blow,
he was not in a hostile attitude, but was quietly standing
on the pavement or adjoining the door-way, and there
approached him and applied the fatal weapon. It further
appears that another man, standing there at the same
time, received a wound in the head, and from the circum-
stances attending that case, I entertain no doubt that that
blow was inflicted by yourself. It also appears that two
other men were stabbed the same night, about the same
time; from whom those wounds were received does not
appear by any positive and direct testimony; the circum-
stances, however, attending the whole case, fairly warrant
the conclusion that they received them from you. It may
be that two of them were wounded at the time the affray
took place, when, according to the testimony of the wo-
men, you were acting on the defensive, and defying any
one to approach you; but the very row was created by
yourself, by your putting your hand within that door, and
moving it about in a manner which left no doubt that
you were endeavoring to apply that knife to the inmates.
That aroused their indignation, and the wounds were in-
flicted under those circumstances—consequently you
have neither justification nor excuse. Taking, then, the
case altogether, it is fairly inferable that you applied that
deadly knife to four individuals, one of whom sunk under
your arm, and now lies mouldering in the grave. For
this offence you have been convicted—for this offence
you are now arraigned to answer before this tribunal;
and it now only remains for the Court to say, under all
the circumstances of the case, what shall be the punish-
ment. The deed has been done—the deceased man lies
in his grave—his wife you have made a widow, and his
children fatherless. The facts of this case have gone
forth to the whole community, and the entire communi-
ty is waiting to see in what estimation a court of justice
holds offences of this description, and what punishment
the Court sitting here, as the administrators of the law
and the protectors of society, will feel to be their duty to
award. We should be recreant to our duty, if on this oc-
casion we were to drop the sword of justice—if we failed
to check, by the sentence of the law, ruthless violence like
yours—and if we extended any thing like lenity to an
individual standing before us in circumstances like
yours. If we look beyond that transaction, we see no-
thing to call for mitigation. We know not your general
character—you have not put that in issue, but we have
too much reason to fear that your habits are bad. This
offence, for which you have now to answer, was com-
mitted about half-past two o'clock in the morning. You,
with others, were rioting about at that unusual hour of
the night; and when you were requested to disperse,
one of your associates had the audacity to say to the offi-
cer, <a class="l" href="#Herald-1841-05-14-Ezra-Knock-Down">“I wish you would go, and then we will have a
knock down.”</a> Characters of this description have long
infested this community; there are too many young men
who have broken loose form the restraints of both parents
and masters, and it becomes necessary that they be curb-
ed and restrained in their riotous course, as well for
their own good as for the peace and safety of society. It
is therefore an act of humanity to them, as well as of pro-
tection to the community, that we enforce the extreme
penalty of the law for their and your correction. They
will then see in what estimation such conduct is held by
the Court, and what punishment they may fear when
called to answer for their offences.
   The jury, to be sure, have recommended you to mercy;
but the power and the duty of fixing your sentence has
been vested by the government in the Court. Recom-
mendations of juries are always entitled to respectful
consideration from the Court; but the Court, after giv-
ing them all due consideration, is not bound to surrender
its power and its judgment on the subject to the hands of
juries. This is especially the case here. We can see
nothing to alter our judgment, or to induce us to recede
from the views we have taken. Although the punish-
ment inflicted upon you may be severe, yet if you have the
sensibility which is common to our nature, and you are
not sunk below the level of humanity, this punishment
will be light and trifling, when compared with the re-
morse of your own conscience. In the course of nature
you have many years before you; but you never can
relieve your conscience from the accusation that Peter
Fitzpatrick, by your hand, lies mouldering in his grave,
and that you have turned his wife and children on the
cold charities of the world. That this reflection may
have a salutary effect upon you, is the sincere wish of
the Court. This, however, is a concern between your-
self, your conscience, and your Creator; but the court
is desirous that what little has now been said may make
a durable impression upon your mind.
   As regards the Court, our duty here is to enforce the
law, and in such a way as will most effectually extend
protection to the community at large. With these views,
the Court feels bound to go to the full extent of the pun-
ishment which the law allows. And I here remark,
that so far as my judgment is concerned, if the discretion
vested in the Court had enabled us to add many years
beyond the period to which we are limited, I should feel
myself in duty bound, not only to the government, but to
the community, which looks to the law and to courts of
justice for redress and for protection, to inflict that far-
ther punishment upon you. Unfortunately, our power
is limited, and the period we can fix is restricted to four
years. Your sentence, therefore, is, that you, Ezra
White, be imprisoned in the State Prison, at Mount
Pleasant, and kept to hard labor for the term of four
years.
   The prisoner resumed his seat, and entered into a con-
versation with Mr. Wright Hawkes, one of his counsel,
with a joyous unconcern, as though he were the least in-
terested spectator in the Court.
   At the close of the proceeding, White was handed over
to A. M. C. Smith, the Deputy Sheriff, and sent up to Sing
Sing in the afternoon boat.

   C<small>OURT OF</small> O<small>YER AND</small> T<small>ERMINER</small>.—S<small>ENTENCE
OF</small> E<small>ZRA</small> W<small>HITE</small>.—We are indebted to the Sunday
Mercury for the following excellent condensation
of the proceedings in the Court of Oyer and Ter-
miner on Saturday:
   Ezra White, convicted of killing Peter Fitzpat-
rick, was brought up to receive sentence. On the
bench were Judge Edwards and Aldermen Purdy
and Benson. The court room was full but not
crowded.
   At the opening of the Court, the District Attor-
ney called for the sentencing of Ezra White, and
the Clerk of the Court, Mr. Vandervoort, then cal-
led upon the prisoner to say why the Court should
not proceed to pass sentence upon him.
   White stood up at the foot of the long table that
runs in front of the bench, motionless, and with
but a slight exhibition of feeling. He said noth-
ing. By his side were his counsel, Messrs. David
Graham and Wright Hawkes.
   Judge Edwards then proceeded to deliver his
sentence. He commenced by stating that the Court
had discovered nothing in the circumstances that
attended the commission of the offence, for which
White now stood up to receive the sentence of the
Court, of a mitigating character; for at the time
of the killing of Fitzpatrick, he was not in a hos-
tile attitude towards any one. And so with regard
to the man who received a wound in his head,
which wound the Court entertained no doubt, had
been inflicted by White. And circumstances fair-
ly warranted the conclusion that the two other
men who were stabbed, received their wounds
from the same hand. The row was created by your-
self, said the Court, and with deadly knife, four in-
dividuals were that night stabbed by you, one to the
death, and his mortal remains are now mouldering
in the grave. The Court then spoke in reproba-
tory terms of the reckless and rowdy conduct of
White and his associates—of the fact that the whole
community was now watching to see what punish-
ment the Court would inflict upon him, and it then
intimated to the prisoner that no lenity could be
shown an individual standing before them as he did.
White's general character was then spoken of—the
fact that his own counsel had produced no evidence
of its goodness on the trial, and of the necessity
that now existed, of restraining the riotous and
rowdy conduct of such as he. For this purpose,
said the Court, the law puts forth its power on this
occasion, to let the class of young men to which
you belong know, that punishment sooner or later
awaits them.
   The fact of the jury having recommended the
prisoner to mercy was next alluded to—a recom-
mendation to which we cannot yield, said the
Court. It was hoped that, as he had many years
before him, being but a young man, this would be
a lesson to him, and have a correcting effect upon
him as upon others. And it was with this view—
the effect upon others—that the Court felt it to be
its bounden duty to sentence him to the full extent
of the law; and if it had any regret, it arose out of
the fact that the law was too limited.
   The prisoner was then sentenced to the prison of
Mount Pleasant, Sing Sing, for the term of four
years, during which to be kept at hard labor.—

<b>Diabolical Attempt to Destroy the National
			Theatre.</b>
   About six o'clock last night, the National Thea-
tre was discovered to be on fire in eight different
places, and under such circumstances as to leave no
possible doubt that the whole was a wicked and ma-
licious attempt to destroy that beautiful edifice,
with all the magnificent properties of the present
enterprising manager.
   It appears that Mr. <u>Oakey</u>, the celebrated panto-
mimist and comic dancer, who with others had as-
sembled to prepare for the evening's performance,
communicated to those around him that a smell of
something burning was very strong in the house; an
investigation was accordingly set on foot; first in the
property room, in which a quantity of bills and other
papers were found to be ignited, evidently for the
purpose of destroying the expensive properties of the
theatre. Mr. Wilson's private room was next ex-
amined, and here all his private papers and other
articles were discovered to be burning. Next,
fire was found under the stairs adjoining the box
office, and leading to Mr. Russell's room, where
	...
   Officers Gil. Hays and Welch were immediately
sent for, to investigate the origin of the fire, and dis-
cover the wickedly malicious scoundrel who could
have planned and executed so diabolical a crime,
and the result was, that the lamp-lighter to the
house—a man named Shiers—was taken into custo-
dy on suspicion. He had exhibited a revengeful
spirit in the course of the day, in consequence of
being refused “orders” for several of his friends,
and had threateningly said to a person connected
with the theatre, “there will be no performance to-
night.”
   Other circumstances tended to fix suspicion on
him, and he is now in the hands of the officers of
justice, by whom the whole matter will be thorough-
ly sifted.

   <i>Atrocious attempt to fire the National Theatre—
Timely discovery, and preservation of the building,
and arrest of the supposed incendiary</i>—About five
o'clock last evening, Mr. Burton, the manager, arriv-
ed from a visit to Philadelphia, and accompanied by
Mr. Wemyss, the stage manager, walked to the
theatre. To this fortunate circumstance may be at-
tributed the preservation of this beautiful structure.
Mr. Burton on entering the theatre by the rear en-
trance was met by Mr. <u>Okie</u>, one of the company,
who remarked, that he thought he smelt fire about
the house. Messrs. Burton and Wemyss were not
slow in taking the hint. They immediately com-
	...
   Mr. Russell, the Treasurer, with Mr. Glessing, his
assistant, had by this time commenced a search in
	...
While this search was in progress, a roll of paper was
thrown from an upper window into Leonard-street,
which was picked up by Mr. Smith, of the Refectory,
and which on examination was found to contain a
quantity of friction matches.
   In the Turkish Saloon below was found part of a
box of matches, which were found to correspond in
quality and appearance with those found in the street;
an attempt had also evidently been made to fire the
saloon. The author of this atrocious <u>villany</u> has
doubtless been discovered and is now in the tombs
awaiting an examination. His name is George
Shiers, an employee of the Gas Company, who as-
sisted in lighting the house at nights. This indivi-
dual had been frequently heard to threaten the es-
tablishment in consequence of a reduction of his sa-
lary, at which he expressed his indignation, saying
at the same time, “there'<u>l</u> be fire about the house,”
and yesterday he told one of the choristers that there
would be “no performance at the house to-night.”
Upon Shiers arrest, on searching his person, keys
were found which would afford him access to every
part of the house. He will be probably examined
this day.

   G<small>LENTWORTH'S</small> E<small>SCAPE</small>, &c.—This distinguished
youth, the companion in morals and in money, of
Messrs. Blachford, Bowen, and others “of that ilk,”
has escaped from the hands of a jury. This escape
was made on Saturday night, with some haste, and
after buttoning up his coat and breeches as fast as he
could.
   Yet the disagreement of the jury is a matter of
little consequence. The evidence is before the
country, and they have made up their opinion of the
“pipe-layers” beyond the power of all petty or penny
juries.
   But have we not come to a pretty pass in these
days? There is Eldridge in Philadelphia—he has
also escaped on his third trial, by the disagreement
of the jury. Let Madame Restell at once go to trial.
She cannot be convicted—nor can any person be
convicted in these halcyon days, but the poor devils
of loafers who steal a loaf to fill their bellies, or a
pair of breeches to cover them. The administra-
tion of justice is corrupt to the foundation. Politics
and banking have covered the whole land with im-
morality, licentiousness, crime and venality of all
kinds. The difference between the saint and the
scoundrel is gone for ever—they are both equal—
both fit for the State Prison or the State Legislature.
   We propose James B. Glentworth for the next

the steamboat Mr. White evinced considerable indis-

<m9><b><cl>C</cl>ASTLE	POINT	AND		THE		ELYSIAN
FIELDS.</b>—The delightful Pleasure Grounds at Hoboken
have been put in complete order, and, having been much improved,
are now open to visiters. The cool and shady walks, winding for a
long distance on the banks of the majestic Hudson, offer a pleasant
and refreshing retreat from the hot and dusty pavements of the city.
   The heights of Castle Point (which are still open to the public) com-
mand an extensive and beautiful prospect, embracing at a glance the
noble bay dotted with islands, and enlivened with vessels gliding in
every direction on its bosom; the city, with its numerous spires, and
the distant hum of its busy inhabitants; while the river, whitened
with sails, is lost in the distance beyond the towering palisades, pre-
senting altogether a scene lovely beyond description, and of its kind
unequaled.
   By a newly opened and well shaded walk, protected from the rays
of the sun by a grove of noble oaks, visiters may descend in a few
minutes to the Colonade, where, on moderate terms, are furnished re-
freshments of the best kind, and suitable to the season. The ferry-
boats have been comfortably refitted with awnings, &c. and leave Bar-
clay and Canal-streets every few minutes—the ferriage, as heretofore,
6½ cents. In no other part of the world, perhaps, can so rich a treat<!-- Looks like 3 dots (⠇ OR ⡆ OR ⋮) over "|", but the sign is clearly visible in Tribune-1841-08-07, &c. -->

   <i>Suit for Breach of Marriage Promise spoiled, and the
Lawyer done out of his Fees</i>.—On the 16th day of April last
a young Pearl-street Milliner named Jane ——— went to a
gentleman of the bar and wished to employ him to commence
a breach of promise of marriage suit against her defaulting
lover. She accordingly made affidavit that her <i title="ex-">ci devant</i>
lover, George ———, a clerk in a cotton broker's office in
Wall-street, had wooed her for nearly three years with the
avowed intention of making her his wife. That she kindly
received his attentions to the exclusion of all other admirers,
and that about seven months previous a reciprocal agreement
was entered into to become husband and wife, and that the
month of April of the present year was appointed as the pe-
riod when the nuptials were to be solemnized in due form of
law. That she went with George, her intended, about two
months before and selected and hired a house, for them, as
married people, to reside in; that furniture for it was pro-
cured and the wedding garments purchased, and at the in-
stance of her lover, the friends of the parties were invited to
hold themselves in readiness to appear and grace the nuptial
fete as their guests; but that on Sunday the 12th of April,
George, the lover, came with views far different from those
that have been stated, and bluntly informed his late lady-love
that he could not marry her, as he was attached to another
who more completely engrossed his affections; and that he
then left her and had not returned to redeem his plighted en-
gagements.
   Independent of this, which was sworn to before a commis-
sioner, she stated that George, after the purchase of the
furniture, had placed it in her possession, as he also had the
linen for a number of shirts he had left for her to make;
these he wished her to restore; but in the true spirit of an
insulted maiden, she declared that she would break the fur-
niture to pieces, and tear the shirts to tatters, rather than to
see them again in his possession. As a matter of course
they remained in her possession.
   After this demonstration of spirit, she applied to the law-
yer as above stated, and wished him to commence suit against
her treacherous lover for <i>non</i>-suiting her by his refusal to
wed. A letter was written by the counsel to George on the
subject, who sent a friend to her, requesting her not to pro-
secute. She, however, persisted, and resolved to let the law
light upon her former adorer, and a writ was issued for him
and damages laid at $5,000. She then returned to her coun-
sel, reported proceedings, and at his instance agreed to set-
tle the matter, and 'cry quit,' if he would pay her $200. She
returned the next day, said he had been to visit her and ex-
pressed a belief that he would marry her if she would consent
to be his. She returned again and informed her counsel that
her lover had agreed again to marry her, and soon after the
fates or the priest made them one—and the counsel heard
that they were married. He then wrote a letter to her as
Mrs. F. reminding her of her omission to pay him his fees
and costs accruing on the inchoate suit, but she replied with
much <i>sang froid</i>, that she was not Mrs. F. but had become
Mrs. G., and that he might go and whistle for his fees, and
get them as he could; and the result of the whole matter is,
that the lady has obtained a husband through the instrumen-
tality of the lawyer, and the lawyer has, by a mariage <u title="manoeuvre">ma-
nœuvre</u>, lost his fees, which illy <i>suits</i> his feelings and his
purse—and for which he will in all probability commence <i>suit</i>
against the defaulting wife and husband unless they are
speedily paid.

   T<small>HE</small> P<small>IPE</small> L<small>AYERS</small>—C<small>ATCHING AT</small> S<small>TRAWS</small>.—Mas-
ter Biddy Brooks, who writes the epistolary twaddle
from New York, that appears in the National Intelli-
gencer, speaking of the trial of Glentworth, says:—
<m9>   <u title="Notwithstanding">Nothwithstanding</u> the District Attorney has parti-
cipated largely in this feeling [meaning political feel-
ing] he has, nevertheless, at times shown great mag-
nanimity, and completely exonerated Messrs.
Blatchford, Bowen, Draper, and Grinnell from all the
infamous charges which were put in circulation
against them.</m9>
   There is hardly a word of truth in this statement.
Mr. Whiting exonerated Mr. Grinnell, so far as to
believe that he was duped by the others, but both
Mr. Whiting and the public believe that Blatchford,
Bowen and Draper, are just as guilty of pipe-laying
as Glentworth. They furnished the money and
Glentworth only did the work.
			—————
   T<small>HE</small> N<small>EW</small> M<small>AYOR</small>.—Robert H. Morris, the new
Mayor, the great terror to pipe-layers, bids fair to
be one of the most efficient and popular we ever
had. Every body approves his message. In the po-
lice and peace-keeping department, he will be as
manly and prompt as Aaron Clark, who was one of
the best we ever had. We <u>dont</u> care a button for
the politics of either—we only value their good qual-
ities for governing our unruly city. The new May-
or will, no doubt, introduce many new reforms into
practice—particularly in relation to the cleanliness
of the streets—the police, &c.
			—————
   T<small>HE</small> D<small>OG</small> L<small>AW IN</small> F<small>ORCE</small>.—In consequence of a
death by hydrophobia last week, the Mayor has put
in force the dog law, and made several appointments
to the respectable office of dog-killer. Good.
   We have not heard whether the Rev. David Hale
has been appointed to office this year or not—but we
presume he will be. We would also request the
Mayor to appoint James Watson Webb and Charles
King to office at once—salary two dollars per day,
weapons included. They have been seeking office
for a long time, and almost ready to eat each other
up by the delay. We ask nothing for Colonel
Stone at present, he having been wisely provided for
in the State Lunatic Asylum. <i title="Praise to God">Laus Deo</i>.
			—————
   H<small>OAX ON</small> H<small>OAX</small>.—The wonderful managers of the
Frederick County Bank, Maryland, now say that
they have received a letter from the robbers, offer-
ing to return the State stocks, &c. provided they
will say nothing further of the gold. No doubt of it.
These financial burglars have just discovered that
they robbed too much when they robbed their own
vaults of State stocks. Take them back by all
means. It is only another chapter in the farce of
self-robbery.
			—————
   M<small>ORALS AND</small> D<small>ECENCY</small>.—The Rev. Col. Stone, of
the Lunatic Asylum, and Editor of the Commercial
Advertiser, has been very busy for several months
past in showing up one Partridge, a woman of the
town. This is the suitable employment for a cor-
rupt, bloated Wall street paper, or a Wall street Edi-
tor.
			—————
   U. S. B<small>ANK</small>.—There is an <i>on dit</i> that Col. Drayton
has resigned the presidency of the U. S. Bank. If
he has not resigned, he ought to resign—and that
soon.
			—————
   T<small>HE ONLY</small> R<small>ESPECTABLE</small> T<small>HEATRE NOW</small> O<small>PEN</small>.—
Such the “Evening Star” says of the Bowery—one of
the most disgusting schools of sin and licentiousness
this country ever saw. Morals with a vengeance!

		<m8>Reported for the Courier & Enquirer.</m8>
   <i>Another Murder or Painful Suicide</i>.—The Coro-
ner was yesterday summoned to the house of a
Swede named John Roth, who kept a small grocery
or porter-house at <u>27</u> Mulberry street. Roth, it was
reported, had committed suicide by cutting his throat
with a razor. He was an uncommonly large athletic
man, of good habits, and to all appearances perfectly
sane and happy. He was found lying on the
floor of his room, over the bar room; his throat
dreadfully gashed; a razor lying on the table nearby;
and he quite dead.
   His wife stated, that a few moments before his
death, a man whom she did not know—said to be a
seaman on board the U. S. ship Dolphin—called up-
on him, and they together went to the room where
deceased was found. They remained together some
little time, when the strange man came down, called
for a glass of wine, which he drank; and as he was
in the act of leaving, coolly remarked, “By the way,
Mrs. Roth, do you know that your husband up stairs
has just cut his throat?”—when he left the house,
and Mrs. Roth hastened to convince herself of the
dreadful reality.
   Mrs. Roth also stated, that her husband had about
him when last she saw him a pocket-book containing
a considerable sum of money. Upon searching the
body, none of the property thus described could be
found.
   The Coroner, in view of this state of things, defer-
red holding the inquest till this day; and meanwhile
a search for the strange man was set on foot.

   <i>Atrocious Murder</i>.—About 2 o'clock on Tuesday,
the Coroner was summoned to the corner of 28th
street and 3d avenue, to an ante-mortem examination
on the body of a Mrs. Margaret Russell, who was
lying <i>in articulo mortis</i>, from a blow with an axe,
with which she had been struck by her husband,
Patrick Russell! On his arrival, the Coroner found
that the information was too true, and the ill-fated
woman was quite insensible; she was immediately
removed to the Bellevue Hospital, and the operation
of <u title="trepanning">trepaining</u> the skull, which had been horribly
fractured in the region of the temporal bone, was
performed by Dr. Hyslop in the presence of the
Coroner. No hopes however were entertained of the
woman's recovery.
   It appears that the brother of Mrs. <u>Russel</u>, from
whom her husband rented the house which he occu-
pied, had frequently threatened to turn them out of
doors, and that Russell had swore that he would kill
either his brother-in-law or his wife. About 12 o'-
clock, on Tuesday, Russell ordered two of his nephews
who lived with him to leave the room in which he and
his wife were, and on their doing so, the wretch im-
mediately seized an axe, and without saying a word,
with it felled his wife to the ground! His nephews
heard the blow and supposing that he was breaking
the windows, rushed into the apartment, and found
the unfortunate woman weltering in her blood and
apparently lifeless.
   The unfortunate woman survived till 11 o'clock
on Tuesday night when she expired. She was 36
years of age, a native of <u>Germany</u>, the mother of one
child by a former husband and of two by Russell.
<u>Russel</u> is 55 years of age, born in Ireland.
   The wretched husband fled and was pursued by one
of his own children, to the foot of <u>24</u>th street, where
he plunged into the East River and waded into the
water <u>up to his chin</u>. The little boy called for help,
and a Mr. <u>Cochran</u> and several other persons came
and secured him and had him committed to prison,
upper Police.
   The Coroner yesterday held an inquest on the
body of deceased, and the Jury rendered a verdict
that the deceased came to her death, in consequence
of blows inflicted by her husband, Patrick Russell.

   <i>Glentworth</i>.—We understand that J. B. Glentworth
wsa yesterday surrendered by his bail. We under-
stand that after much effort he succeeded in <u title="procuring">procu-
ing</u> bail anew, and that he is still at large.

   <i>Teeth</i>.—In the Common Pleas, yesterday, before
Judge Ingraham, a dentist named <u>Lemuel</u> Ross, re-
covered of Mr. Abijah Matthews, the sum of $63, for
a set of teeth furnished by the plaintiff. The bill of
particulars set forth in the declaration, was $188 37.
Before going to trial, however, $100 was thrown off,
and of the $88 37, remaining, the Jury gave the sum
above stated.

   <i>National Theatre</i>.—Justice Parker is still pursuing
the investigation, in the matter of burning of the
National Theatre. No new witnesses were discover-
ed or further progress made yesterday toward a solu-
tion of the mystery. Hurd, one of the suspected in-
cendiaries now in prison, was brought up, but refused
to answer any questions. Another attempt to ex-
amine him will be made this day.
   Mr. Burton has leased the spacious Hall in Wash-
ington Hall, corner of Broadway and Chambers-st.,
and has already commenced operations, in fitting it
up for the purpose of performing Vaudevilles and
other light warm weather entertainments.

   <i>More Murder in prospective</i>.—Just previous to the
closing of the Police Office last evening, a man in
great haste, rushed into the presence of Justice Mat-
sell and stated that a woman residing in Batavia st.
had given something from a phial to two children,
and had taken a quantity of the same herself, by
which the three had all been taken dreadfully sick.
A physician had been called who pronounced it a
case of poisoning. Officer Stanton was dispatched
to the scene of action to make the requisite inquiries,
but at last accounts had not returned to the office.
   The Coroner was also yesterday notified that the
body of an unknown man had been found floating in
the North River foot of Fulton st. and also that a
child had been drowned at the foot of 17th street,
East River—particulars not transpired.

   A Mr. Lessing, a very respectable, amiable man,
who keeps a grocery on the corner of 24th-street and
3d Avenue, was severely stabbed and cut in four or
five places by a drunken negro, on Monday night.

   C<small>ORONER'S</small> O<small>FFICE</small>—A<small>NOTHER</small> D<small>OMESTIC</small> T<small>RAGEDY</small>.—
On Wednesday, the Coroner proceeded to Bellevue Hos-
pital, to hold an inquest on the body of Margaret Rus-
sell, aged 36, who died the previous night from blows in-
flicted by her husband. It appeared that Patrick Russell
and his wife Margaret lived at the corner of 28th street
and 3d avenue, and that Margaret had occasional diffi-
culties with her husband, who was a man of violent tem-
per. About 11 o'clock on Wednesday morning the atten-
tion of the sister of deceased was aroused by a noise in
the room occupied by Russell and his wife, and on pro-
ceeding to the apartment, she found Mrs. Russell on the
floor bleeding profusely from a large wound on the right
side of the head. Another sister of the deceased was then
sent for, and in a few minutes the murderer was brought
in by some citizens, and the woman was removed to the
hospital, where she died.
   Rose Kelly, the other sister of deceased, deposed that
Margaret Russell was a native of <u>Ireland</u>, and had
been married to her present husband, Patrick, about six
years, by whom she had two children. She also had
one child by her first husband. Witness went into the
room at the desire of the last witness, and found the body
of the deceased as described by her.
   Edward McClaskey deposed that he was the son of the
first witness and was 12 years of age. He was at home,
at his mother's Tuesday morning, about 10 o'clock and
saw Patrick Russell, who appeared to be sober. He said
nothing but went to his room. Presently he came out
and witness heard a moaning in the room and told his
mother, who went with him to the room, and saw his
aunt lying on the floor bloody. At this time witness
could see Patrick Russell crossing by <u>28</u>th street towards
the East River, and he immediately started in pursuit of
him. Patrick only walked fast at first, but seeing wit-
ness after him he ran until he got to the river where
he waded in <u>as high as knees</u>. Witness hallowed
“stop that man,” but no one heard him at first.—
—He continued to make the alarm, but no one came to
assist witness; he told another boy to “watch that man;”
and then he ran to Mr. <u>Conklin</u>'s, and told them what had
happened; and they went and secured Patrick Russell,
who told them he would walk back if they would let
him, and they took him into the room to see his wife, and
then he was taken to the Upper Police Office. In answer
to questions put by the jury, this witness stated that, for
fifteen minutes before he saw Patrick go out, he heard a
knocking on the floor, which induced him to believe that
Patrick was breaking up the furniture. After taking the
testimony of the medical men, who had received the de-
ceased at the hospital. The jury found the following
verdict:—That Margaret Russell came to her death by
a blow or blows inflicted on her head by her husband,
Patrick Russell.
   A<small>NOTHER</small> H<small>OMICIDE OR</small> S<small>UICIDE</small>.—On Wednesday evening
about 5 o'clock, information reached the Coroner that a
man named John Roth, supposed to be a Dutchman, was
lying with his throat cut at his residence No. <u>27</u> Mulber-
ry street. Dr. Archer and Justice Matsell immediately
proceeded to the place, but it was thought prudent to post-
pone the inquest for a short time.
   The body of the deceased presented a most appalling
spectacle. He was an immense sized man, and he was ly-
ing on his back in a small back room completely deluged
with blood and gore. An open razor lay on a chair in the
room, but <i>some distance</i> apart from the corpse. The wound
in the throat was of the most decided character. The
trachea and arteries being completely severed, and death
must have been instantaneous. The wife of the deceased,
who is an Irish woman, says she was below in the bar
when one of her husband's friends came down stairs and
asked for a glass of wine, which she gave him. He then
told her that John had cut his throat, and desired her to
go up stairs. This man who is supposed to belong to the
U. S. brig Dolphin, then left the house, and it is said that
Roth must have had a large amount of money on his per-
son which cannot be found.
   Justice Matsell immediately sent officers in all direc-
tions to arrest the sailor, but up to the time of the office
closing he had not been heard of.
   D<small>ROWNING</small>.—A child was found drowned at the foot of
17th street. A man was found floating in the North
River, at the foot of Fulton street.
   In both cases verdicts of found drowned returned.
   A<small>NOTHER</small> M<small>YSTERY</small>.—Information reached Justice <u>Matsel</u>,
last night, that a woman and two children were likely
to die, in consequence of taking some deleterious drug
or other, either from accident or design. The family
was said to reside in Batavia street. An officer was dis-
patched to ascertain the particulars of the case, but he
did not return by this time of the office closing.
   L<small>IBEL</small>.—A man named John Leyden, said to be one of
the Collectors of the 6th Ward, was yesterday charged
with publishing libels in two of the penny papers, for
the purpose of defaming and maligning the character of
a juvenile lawyer, John C. McGrath. The collector was
held to bail.
   P<small>ETTY</small> T<small>HIEVES</small>.—The setting in of the warm weather
seems to have caused a whole swarm of petty thieves to
walk abroad, seeking for something to devour. Yester-
day about eight different charges were brought before
the police. First, Mike Reynolds, who stole a tin sauce-
pan—secondly, three little negro pests were charged
with picking pockets on the Five Points—Mary Dunn
stole a piece of calico—John M. Arminta stole a silk
handkerchief—Eliza Brown stole a piece of gingham,
and all were severally sent to the tombs.

		<b>Court of Common Pleas.</b>
		  Before Judge Ingraham.
   J<small>UNE</small> 2.—<i><u>Samuel</u> Ross vs. Abijah Matthews</i>.—This was an
action to recover the amount of a bill for dentistry, and for
services rendered to the defendant and his wife. The
bill of particulars amounted to $188 37, and included a set
of permanent teeth for the wife of the defendant and a set
of temporary teeth for himself. The permanent set for
the lady were put down at $100, but the plaintiff's coun-
sel abandoned this claim as untenable.
   For the defence, it was set up that the teeth were not
such teeth as a gentleman ought to have in his mouth,
much less such as he ought to pay for. That the masti-
cators were not good in color, deficient in ease, unable to
bear in the mouth, for more than half an hour at a time,
and had sundry other bad qualities about them.
   The plaintiff's counsel contended that the teeth were
as good as could be got at that price, and that the defend-
ant had promised to pay. The jury found for the plain-
tiff,<u title="Nothing!">				</u>

   C<small>ORONER'S</small> O<small>FFICE</small>.—An inquest was held on the
body of John Roth, who resided at No. <u>26</u> Mulberry
street, and was found on Wednesday afternoon with
his throat cut (<i>vide</i> Herald of yesterday) in the most
efficient manner. After a patient investigation, the
jury found that John Roth committed suicide while
in a state of mental derangement.
   The sailor who had been in company with Roth
a few minutes before the deed was done, was brought
before the jury, but nothing appearing against him,
he was discharged. It is proper to say that Roth's
pocket-book, with the money, was found in the bed,
so “poor Jack” was honorably acquitted of every-
thing except fright at the sight of blood.
   C<small>LUB</small> L<small>AW</small>.—At the request of Dr. C. H. Stillman,
of Fourth street, the coroner proceeded to Sheriff
street for the purpose of holding an inquest on a man
who received a severe blow from a watchman, about
ten days back, which produced such a severe injury
of the brain and spinal marrow, that notwithstanding
the best medical treatment, the patient died on Wed-
nesday. The name of the deceased was Edward
Fury, but no inquest was held, as Dr. Archer was
fully satisfied that the man had died from natural
causes.
   M<small>ORE</small> D<small>ROWNING</small>.—The firing of a salute in the
harbor of New York, is generally a sort of God send
to the Coroner, as the concussion in the air usually
causes two or three dead bodies to float on the sur-
face of the bay or the rivers. It is doubtful indeed
whether any city of equal population to New York,
even exhibits so large a proportion of drowned per-
sons in the course of the year, as our annals would
present. Yesterday afternoon the Coroner held in-
quests on two cases, one the body of a man at the
pier near Franklin market, which had lain many
days in the water, and was in a most terrible state
of decomposition. The other was a negro found at
the foot of James slip, supposed to be the body of
one Sally Jones, who committed suicide two nights
since.
   Information was also received at the Coroner's of-
fice that another body had been found.

—Yesterday Thomas Hurd was brought before Jus-

sulted as follows, which is copied verbatim from the

residence?
   A. I refuse to answer any question, my counsel,

   Hurd afterwards refused to sign the examination,
and the magistrate fully committed him for trial, in-
forming his legal advisers and all interested, that <i>no

the Tombs.

		GENERAL SESSIONS.
   This Court opened, for the June term, yesterday.
The calendar contains 21 new, 55 old—total 76 prison
cases.
   Eight grand jurors appeared upon a call of their
names. Those present were discharged for the day.
The absentees were severally fined each $25, and a
new panel was ordered for this day.
   A petit jury was formed, and <i>Daniel Boyle</i> and
<i>Hugh Burns</i> were put on trial on charge of highway
robbery, in having, on the 13th day of May last,
knocked down and robbed a Jew pedlar, named <u>Man-
nessah</u> Goldberg, of his pocket-book, containing a
considerable sum of money. The prosecution failed
to produce testimony sufficient to sustain the charge
of robbery, and the jury acquitted Boyle, and found
Burns guilty of assault and battery.
   The court then adjourned.

			FANNY ELSSLER.
   The theatrical gazettes of our City announce that Mlle.
Fanny Elssler—the <i>divine</i> Fanny, as she has been most im-
piously styled by her admirers—has consented again to irra-
diate our City with the light of her presence, after clearing
in her Southern campaign some $50,000 over her most lav-
ish expenditures, and that she will soon bless the longing
eyes of her idolaters with an exhibition of some of the most
brilliant and costly pirouettes that ever yet added grace to
the refinement or delicacy to the purity of New-York. An
adoring public will of course hold their dollars in hand, ready
for a rush pell-mell to the box-office.
   Now we do not propose at this time to enter generally upon
the question of the propriety and wholesomeness of theatri-
cal entertainments, but we desire to submit to the reputable
and virtuous W<small>OMAN</small> of New-York some considerations bear-
ing on the propriety and rightfulness of their countenancing
the career of Mlle. Elssler by appearing as spectators of
her performances.
   We entreat every true Woman of our city to lay aside
for one moment all preconceptions and prejudices relating to
Theatres, and steadily regard this matter in its naked aspect.
Let us suppose that a female of such character as Madame
Elssler's notoriously is—one who even had the common excuse
of necessity for a life of wantonness and shame—were to
advertise to deliver a Lecture to-morrow evening on some
interesting theme, which she was perfectly competent to elu-
cidate, how many reputable Women would think proper to
be among the number of her auditors? Could there possi-
bly be six? three? one?—But is the case better when the
heroine is deprived by her heaps of treasured wealth, her
every circumstance, from the horrible necessity of leading a
life of infamy—when instead of an unexceptionable Lecture,
she proposes to make such an exhibition of her powers and
her person as that of Madame Elssler—and when instead of
a decent lecture-room this exhibition is to take place with
other wantons in front of the maiden or matron spectator,
two drunkeries in the rear, and a public assignation-hall over
head? How far can these delicate concomitants be calcu-
lated to purify the atmosphere and justify the presence of
virtuous Women?
   We plead for Woman in this matter; and we ask those of
the sex who will be importuned to attend the performances
of Mlle. Elssler, to consider the consequences of compliance,
not to themselves merely, but to the cause of Virtue and
Purity universally. In the eyes of the mass of mankind,
whatever is hallowed by the presence of reputable Women
is virtuous, proper, commendable—at any rate as good as
they care for. What, then, must be the standard of female
virtue established in the minds of the masculine thousands
assembled to gaze on the revealings of the pirouette and the
cachucha, as they turn their eyes for a moment inquiringly
from the stage and meet the ardent, admiring gaze of intelli-
gent and reputable Women fixed approvingly, admiringly on
the voluptuous spectacle before them? Who does not re-
alize that the corrupt in soul will return with a keener zest
to their enjoyment, confirmed and emboldened in their innate
conviction that all virtue is but a decent hypocrisy or a cun-
ning calculation? Who can shut her eyes to the conviction
that the smiles, the cheers, the bravos bestowed upon this
gilded, glittering, shameless creature—the cast-off mistress
of half the titled libertines of Europe—are in truth ovations
to brazen harlotry and encouragements to persist in guilty
outrage of the laws of Society and of God? Who can fail
to realize that every cheer to this fallen spirit is in truth a
scoff at female virtue and an impulse to female degradation?
Women of New York! how many of you will countenance
by your presence and your plaudits the career of Fanny
Elssler?

   <i>Fatal Effects of the Hot Weather</i>.—In consequence
of the excessive heat which has prevailed for the past
two days, a number of deaths have occurred and ma-
ny persons have fallen down in the streets and have
been restored with difficulty.
   A laborer on the Croton Water Works, named Mi-
chael Egan, who arrived from Ireland only on Sun-
day week last, while employed near 42d street in a
state of profuse perspiration, drunk hastily of cold
water, and in a few minutes after fell down and al-
most instantly expired. His death took place about
5 o'clock on Tuesday afternoon. The Coroner's Jury
rendered verdict of death from drinking cold water.
   Another laborer, while at work yesterday, on the
8th Avenue, came to his death from the same cause.
The result of the Coroner's inquest has not yet trans-
pired.
   The Coroner also, yesterday held an Inquest at
Blackwell's Island, on the body of a wretched va-
grant named John McGinnis, who was the day pre-
vious committed as a vagrant for 6 months. He was
found dead in his cell. Verdict, death from delirium
tremens.

   C<small>OURT OF</small> S<small>ESSIONS</small>.—<i>Friday</i>.—Before the Recorder,
Judges Lynch and Noah, and Aldermen Lee and Pollock.
   In the case of James B. Glentworth, on whose behalf a
reduction of bail from $5000 to $500 was on Thursday ap-
plied for by his counsel, the Court stated that when the
amount of bail was originally fixed, there were seven indict-
ments against the accused for as many distinct offences.—
Subsequently six of those indictments had been disposed of
by demurrer; and only one remained on which the accused
had been tried, the jury being unable to agree. Every disa-
greement of a jury increased the legal presumption of inno-
cence; and the Court therefore deem it proper and right to
reduce the amount of bail from $5000 to $1000, in which
sum unexceptionable bail will be taken.
   The following sentences were then passed, viz.:
   Henry Taylor, colored man, convicted of manslaughter in
the 3d degree, in killing Joseph Smith, also colored, was sen-
tenced to the State Prison for the term of 4 years, the high-
est allowed by law.
   Alexander G. <u>Coxe</u>, convicted in December last of obtain-
ing $110 under false pretences, was sentenced to the City
Prison for 30 days.
   John <u>Ferden</u>, convicted of grand Larceny in stealing a case
of silks worth $465 of <u>Gignoux</u> & Co., was sentenced to the
State Prison for 2 years.
   Bridget Hickey, a girl of 15, convicted of burglary in the
3d degree, in breaking into the store of John Weller, was
sent to the House of Refuge.
   William Thompson, convicted of petit larceny, second of-
fence, was sentenced to the Penitentiary for two years.
   William Clark, convicted of obtaining money ($10) under
false pretences, was sentenced to the Penitentiary <u>sixty</u> days.
   William J. Cummings, convicted of petit larceny, steal-
ing a watch—Penitentiary 4 months.
   Hugh Burns, convicted of assault and battery on <u>Manaseh</u>
Goldberg—City Prison one week and pay a fine of $25.
  George P. <u>Geiser</u>, convicted, by confession, of an assault
and battery on Constable Kewan—City Prison 10 days.
   John <u>Crowin</u>, convicted on two indictments of receiving
stolen goods, was sentenced on the first to the City Prison
for 10 days and pay a fine of $25, and on the second indict-
ment a similar fine and imprisonment.
   John Williams and William <u>Stevenson</u>, convicted of as-
sault and battery, not appearing for sentence, their recogni-
zances were forfeited.
   <u>Christopher Breman</u> was tried for grand larceny, stealing
a trunk containing boys' clothing, a watch worth $30, and
other articles, worth together $51, from Jonathan D. <u>Howell</u>
of 9 Mangin st. on the 11th May, at night. The property
was taken from the garret of the house, and the watch taken
to Jackson's pawnbroker shop in said street to pledge, which
led to his arrest.
   The jury found him guilty, and the Court sentenced him
to the State Prison for three years.
   James Reed, aged <u>17</u>, was tried for an assault and battery
with an attempt to commit a rape, on <u>Mary Ann Millette</u>,
a child only 9 years of age, at No. 204 Sixteenth-street,
on the 12th March last. The jury found the accused <i>not
guilty</i>.
   Banard McKee, an old man of 70, indicted for an assault
and battery on his wife Mary, a woman of half his age, with-
drew his plea of not guilty and pleaded the indictment.
Plea received and recorded.
	...
   C<small>ORONER'S</small> I<small>NQUEST</small>.—An inquest was hel yesterday
at the house of Chauncey St. John, 19 West st. on the body
of an unknown man, found drowned at the foot of Morris st.
The deceased was dressed in a check shirt, blue cloth vest,
and canvass pantaloons, and had the appearance of having
been in the water a long time, and his body so much disfigured
as to be unrecognized. Verdict, found drowned.

			<b>General Sessions.</b>
Present his Honor the Recorder, Judges Noah and
		Lynch, and two Aldermen.
   J<small>UNE</small> 11.—<i>In re James B. Glentworth at the suit of the
people</i>.—In this case the Recorder delivered the
opinion of the Court, on the motion made by Mr.
Glentworth's counsel, for a reduction of bail.
   His Honor said that at the time the bail was fixed
at $5000 there were seven indictments against the
defendant, that six of those were disposed of by the
Court, on <u title="demurrer">demurer</u>, in favor of the defendant, and
that on the other, the jury could not agree on a ver-
dict. The Court could not refrain from noticing the
fact that every disagreement of a jury increased the
legal presumption of the innocence of the accused,
and the Court, having all these circumstances before
it, would order the sureties in $5000 to be discharged,
on condition that the defendant found two good and
sufficient sureties in the sum of $1000, so as to ensure
his attendance in Court whenever he should be re-
quired to take a new trial.
   Mr. James S. Smith then asked for an order for
the Police Magistrates to take the bail, which their
Honors granted, on condition that the District Attor-
ney have due notice of the bail.
   His Honor directed the following convicts to be
paraded for sentence:—
   Henry Taylor, negro, convicted of manslaughter
in the third degree, in killing another negro, in the
month of April last.
   His Honor, the Recorder, adjudged the negro man
slayer to suffer for four years at Sing Sing, that being
the full extent of the law.
   Alexander G. Coxe, an ex-Major in the army of
Brigadier General Southerland, of Navy Island ce-
lebrity, convicted two terms since of obtaining goods
under false pretences, was directed to be placed at
the bar. Coxe, being asked the usual question, said
he was absent from the Court when the jury returned
their verdict, and he has no other knowledge of said
verdict except what he derived from the Clerk of the
Court, and he now objected to the verdict as illegal,
because recorded during his absence.
   He also denied the false pretences, and said he
had suffered an imprisonment of four months before
his trial.
   The Recorder said it could be of no use entering
on the merits of the case, because the jury had
passed upon the charge, and Coxe insisted on read-
ing two affidavits. His Honor, the Recorder, then
took a brief review of the circumstances under
which Coxe was convicted, and adjudged him to be
imprisoned in the city prison for thirty days.
   John <u>Ferdon</u> convicted of grand larceny, in steal-
ing a valuable case of umbrella silks, the property
of <u title="Gigenous in Herald-1841-06-09">Gigounr</u> & Co., was next put to the bar.
   The court adjudged him to the state prison for
two years.
   Bridget Hickey was next paraded.
   His Honor, the Recorder, lectured this black-eyed
little sinner severely, and adjudged her to the House
of Refuge <i>sine die</i>.
   William Thompson, a confirmed thief, convicted
of petty larceny, it being the second offence, was
next called up.
   His Honor adjudged this convict to dig stone of
Blackwell's Island for two years.
   William Clark convicted of obtaining money un-
der false pretences.
   This loafer of the genteel order, was a sort of in-
cipient financier, and raised an unauthorized loan on
the credit of one of his friends, for the small sum of
$10.
   The court adjudged him for this offence, to the
stone digging process for <u>ninety</u> days*.
   William J. Cummings for stealing a watch, was
sent to the penitentiary for four months.
   Hugh Burns indicted for robbing a foreign Jew <u titie="pedlar OR peddler">ped-
dlar</u>, but convicted of only knocking out two of the
<u>Jews</u> teeth and otherwise maltreating him, was next
put to the bar.
   His Honor the Recorder, adjudged Burns to the
tombs for one week, and to pay a fine of $25, and
this his Honor called “making an example of Burns,
lest such cases should become somewhat too preva-
lent in this community!”
   George P. <u>Geizer</u>, for beating an officer of the Ma-
rine Court, was sent to the tombs for ten days.
   The sentence of the Court on Julia Tooker was
postponed until Tuesday next.
   John Williams and William <u>Stevenson</u>, not ap-
pearing to hear the sentence of the Court, their sure-
ties were estreated.
   John <u>Cronin</u>, a junk shop man, was called up on
two convictions of receiving stolen property of little
negro loafers.
   The Court lectured John considerably, and sent
him to the tombs for ten days for each offence, and
further to pay a fine of $25 for each offence, making
twenty days imprisonment and a fine of $50. John
grumbled much at this sentence, but could not get it
reduced.
<d>[Col.6]</d>
   <u>Christian Brennan</u> was put on his trial for a grand
larceny in stealing a trunk of wearing apparel and
watch, value $51, the property of Jonathan D. <u>How-
ell</u>, of No. 9 Mangin street. The case was clearly
made out, and the jury found him guilty without
leaving their seats.
   The Court immediately adjudged him to the State
Prison for three years.
   R<small>APE</small>.—James Reed a lubberly ill-looking boy, ap-
parently about <u>fourteen</u> years old, was put on his
trial charged with attempting to commit a rape on a
little girl, named <u>Mary Ann Millett</u>, who did not ap-
pear to be more than ten years of age.
   The details of this case were unfit for publication,
and the jury, after listening to the testimony adduced
pro and con, acquitted the boy, and the court ad-
journed to Monday, at 11 o'clock.
   * N<small>OTE</small>—Major Alexander G. Coxe, for obtaining
<s>s</s>egars to the value of $100 from a poor ignorant fo-
reigner, was merely adjudged to stay for thirty days
in the tombs, whilst Clark, for illegally borrowing
the sum of $10, was sent to <u title="herd">hurd</u> with the most aban-
doned characters and to dig stone for <u>ninety</u> days!
Now we should like to know on what principle of
criminal jurisprudence two such very different de-
grees of punishment should have been <u title="meted">meeted</u> out, to
a pair of such respectable professors of the art of vic-
timization. The ways of the wise, as <u title="Solomon">Soloman</u> ob-
served, are truly astounding to common folks.

   E<small>DITOR IN</small> T<small>ROUBLE</small>.—Horace Greeley, the galva-
nized squash, has recently paid $80 to compromise a
suit brought against him by the U. S. District Attor-
ney, for penalties incurred for violations of the Post
Office laws and regulations. It is said that forty or
fifty other suits for similar violations have recently
been commenced. Nearly a bushel of New Worlds
have been detected in the same illicit correspond-

   <i>Jane Brush and her Cow—M. W. Dodd, Brick
Church Chapel</i>.—This is a translation from the
French, by the same fair hand whose fine version of
Dumas' Gaul and France, we noticed last week.
   It is a beautiful story, and none the less so, we dare
say, for the <i>dovetailing</i> of the translator's charming
imagination into the text—for, she tells us that she
has added to the original—though it is so ingenious-
ly done that it is quite impossible for us at least to
discover the “spots in the wainscot.” The little
volume furnishes one of the few instances in which a
work professing to be written for children, has been
successful. It is not written <i>down</i> to their feelings
and comprehension, but exactly upon a level with
them. Its language, and the incidents of the tale are
precisely what they should be, to made an impression
and do good. There is no baby talk about it, and
yet, every thing is so said as to adapt itself at once
to the capacity of the young mind at the earliest stage
of its understanding. No better child's book has
ever been written, and <i>we</i>, at any rate, have found it
very delightful reading <i>for children of some age</i>.

<b>A Curious Trial for Receiving Stolen Coffee.</b>
   The time of the five Judges, fat and lean, intelli-
gent and otherwise, was occupied yesterday, from
ten in the morning until almost ten at night, with
the trial of a very intelligent, good looking and appa-
rently respectable Scotchman, named James Ritchie.
   The charge against Ritchie was receiving 171
bags of coffee, each containing 120 pounds, worth
about $<u title="5,000 in Courier-1841-02-05">2,500</u>.
   After a great deal of the time of the court had
been wasted by several tedious talks between Wil-
liam M. Price and the court in relation to a woman,
and Charles O'Conner and the court in relation to
one of his clients, a great rascal, who ought to be in
the state prison; and after Judge Noah had adjust-
ed his wig several times, and put on his spectacles
and pulled them off half a dozen times, and read over
the morning papers, and scribbled the heads of an ar-
ticle for the “Star,” the District Attorney called out
   “Put James Ritchie to the bar.”
   Ritchie was then brought into court, remarkably
well but not showily dressed, and placed at the bar.
   A jury of a curious mixed medley collection of
characters was then sworn; and the District Attor-
ney rose and told them that the prisoner was indict-
ed for receiving several bags of stolen coffee, and
that he expected to be able to prove him guilty.
   Ritchie, it appears, was one of the three brothers,
James, Peter and Thomas. The prisoner, James,
could not procure bail, and had been in prison five
months. He was educated as a lawyer in London,
and when last in England was in the office of the
British Commercial Insurance Company, 35 Corn-
hill. He had also been a vestry clerk. He came to
this country several years ago, and had been a coffee
dealer. Thomas was a sailor, and had been mate of
a vessel.
   Mr. <u>William</u> Merle was the first witness called;
he was a Frenchman.
   He testified that he keeps several stores; kept Nos.
262 and 264 Front street; took possession of that
store on the first of August last. There were, then,
2000 bags of coffee on store; the bags were lettered
“A, B, C, D,” &c. The coffee was placed in the
second and third lofts. In September last, we found
out some bags had been stolen. We went on losing
coffee up till November; one day last November my
foreman showed me a lot of coffee shrewed about
under the hatch, and from there to the back door,
and we traced it through the yard up to the fence
that parts our store from Mr. Ritchie's, who lived at
260 Front street, and kept a junk store. We watch-
ed Ritchie's store, but saw no coffee go into it or
come out of it, except next day among the sweep-
ings of his store I saw some coffee, but I did not
handle any of it. We told the police and kept a
watch to catch the thief.
   <u>Morrell</u>—Did you see any one come that you
caught<u>.</u>
   Merle—They got wind I presume.
   <u>Morrell</u>—Never mind your presumption, sir.
   Merle—There were 171 bags stolen, averaging 120
lbs. each, and worth from 11 to 12 cents.
   Judge Noah, who was getting a little impatient
here pulled up his specs and pulled down his wig,
and cried out, “What kind of coffee was it that was
worth 12 cents a pound?”
   Merle—It was various kinds in the bags—all differ-
ent.
   <i>Cross-examined by <u>Morrell</u></i>—The coffee was there
when I took the store. It was counted, but I never
saw it counted. I don't positively know how much
coffee was in the store. John J. Hicks was the for-
mer lessee of the store.
   John J. Hicks was sworn—I don't know how much
coffee was in the store. Mr. Van Benschoten kept
the account. He handed it to me and I gave it to
Mr. Merle.
   Elias H. Van Benschoten sworn—I think there were
1827 bags of coffee in that store when Mr. Merle took
it. I handed the account to Mr. Hicks. I counted the
bags on the 1st of Aug. and a few days afterwards, and
<u>found found</u> the number right.
   Cross-examined—I didn't examine the bags parti-
cularly.
   George Griffin sworn—(This witness appeared to
be one of the better order of mechanics, pale from
sickness and confinement in prison for the last five
months, is a master cabinet maker from London; he
has been here 9 years.)
   Griffin—I was engaged in stealing this coffee.
   Judge Noah—How's that? Did you steal the cof-
fee? (Surprised.)
   Griffin—I'll tell you. The first I saw of any coffee
being stolen from Merle's store, was when I saw
George Rankin and Tom Ritchie.
   Judge Noah—(Laughing and looking with a know-
ing nod and a chuckle towards the Recorder.) Who's
that you say? Tom Ritchie?
   Griffin—Yes, Sir, Tom Ritchie. (Laughter.)
   Judge Noah—Did Tom Ritchie steal any coffee?
(Laughter.)
   Hays.—(angrily.) Silence in Court, gentlemen;
this is no laughing matter, if Tom Ritchie did steal
coffee.
   Recorder to Noah—Hays calls you to order bro-
ther Noah.
   Noah—Oh! I only laughed to think that there is
so little even in the name of citizen Ritchie. Go on.
   Griffin—Rankin and Tom Ritchie got a ladder,
went into Mr. Merle's loft, lower down four bags of
coffee, gave them to me, and I put them into James
Ritchie's junk store and Tom Ritchie.
   Noah—Stop—not so fast—I want to get all this
down about Tom Ritchie.
   Griffin—James Ritchie was not present.
   Noah—But Tom Ritchie was. (Laughter.)
   Griffin—Yes. The next time George and I went
and got six bags of coffee; and Tom remained be-
low and took them.
   Noah—Tom Ritchie was on the ground that time.
   Griffin—Yes. And so we went on several times till
we got a matter of 90 bags in all at different times. We
could easily put it from over the fence through a win-
dow into the junk shop. The coffee was left there
till <u title="James">Jame</u> Ritchie came there the next morning to see
it. Then it was put into carts and carted away for
sale. James Ritchie paid me $2 a bag, and gave Tom
$2 a bag, and George Rankin $3 a bag.
   Noah—Then Tom Ritchie did not have the largest
share of the plunder.
   Griffin—No.
   Noah—That's not characteristic of the name.
(Laughter.)
   Griffin—We stole altogether from 90 to 100 bags;
but then some more was stolen by Tom Ritchie be-
fore I began.
   Noah—Then Tom Ritchie stole some on his own
hook. (Laughter.)
   Griffin—I don't know what hook he stole it on—
he hooked it himself. (Laughter.) The stolen
coffee was sold to Mr. Gillies, in the 5th street, and to
Gilbert Colgate, or Colgate Gilbert, in Dutch street.
I sold it, and gave the money to James Ritchie. I
have seen James Ritchie up to Gillie's house.
   Cross-examined:—
   Q.—How long have you been a prisoner?
   A.—In the coffee business? (Roars of laughter,
in which Noah joined till his wig shook again.)
   Q.—No, sir, a prisoner.
   A.—Five months.
   Q.—Was you ever arrested for any robbery there?
   A.—I think not, there.
   Q.—Was you ever concerned in any other robbery
elsewhere?
   A.—Well, I believe I was in another store near
there.
   Recorder—Witness, you need not answer such
questions unless you like.
   Witness (with great humility)—Thank you sir<u>?</u>
(Laughter.)
   Cross-examination continued—I occupied the 2d
story, over James Ritchie's store; I fitted up count-
ers and things there, as may be; there was a shed
under the window of my floor, which ran up to
Merle's premises; Mr. James Ritchie has dried cof-
fee on that shed. Before he had that junk shop the
coffee was his business. I made up my mind to
testify against Mr. Ritchie two days after I was ar-
rested. I since justified in the half of $300 bail. I
don't know how much I'm worth now. I've been
plundered by one and another since I've been in pri-
son for the last five months. I'd be worth $150 next
week if Mr. Ritchie paid me that $80 he owes me,
which he's tried to rob me of since I have been in
prison, and he ought to be ashamed of it. I lent him
$40 and $25, all in cash, at two times. I got noth-
ing to show for it. I owe him nothing.
   Direct resumed—I'm a cabinet maker; I've known
Ritchie for ten years; I saw coffee in his store, and
knew it was stolen before I engaged in the busi-
ness.
   Noah—What business?
   Witness—The coffee line. [roars of laughter]
James Ritchie took me to a cellar to deposit much
of the coffee; it was two doors from Charlton street,
on the right hand side; a man name Carter lived up
stairs—he was a Londoner; sometimes I carried it
up there in a horse and wagon—sometimes James—
and sometimes Tom.
   Noah—Then Tom Ritchie worked sometimes?
   Witness—Yes; it was the overplus that was stored
up there, because he was afraid to sell too much at
once.
   Mr. Gillies sworn—I lived at 28 Fifth street; I
keep a spice and coffee factory. I bought coffee from
James Ritchie two or three times during last sum-
mer; not over 1,500 to 2,000 weight of him; I bought
more of Tom Ritchie.
   Noah—Then Tom Ritchie sold some?
   Witness—Yes, sir. James never brought any, ex-
cept a sample, Tom brought it; I think in July; it was
in barrels; Tom sold it, as he said, for himself and
brother; I bought in all from both between 3,000 and
5,000 weight of coffee; it came twice in bags—five
bags at one time. James never told me where he
got it; I gave nine cents a pound for it; <i>I once bought
500 weight of damaged coffee</i>—it was burnt in a fire at
the public store opposite James Ritchie's; I roasted
that with other coffee.
   Cross-examined—I always gave a fair market
<d>[Col.5]</d>
price for it. There was no concealment about it.—
No marks upon the bags I once lent James Ritchie
to buy coffee with. I was once in his employ when
he was in the coffee business in Broadway. He has
always borne a good character for integrity. I took
the coffee I bought to be La Guayra and Rio mixed.
La Guayra coffee has small kernels.
   Here some coffee (No. 1) was shown to witness,
that was taken out of the cellar in <u title="Macdougal">Mac Dougal</u>
street.
   Witness—That don't look like the coffee.
   Some coffee (No. 2) from the bags, still left in
Merle's store, was here shown witness.
   Witness—That don't look like it.
   Shaler—What kind of a way is that to swear
away a man's liberty, by trying to identify kernels
of coffee. (Laughter.)
   Judge Noah—We found it difficult to identify the
pork the other day—(roars of laughter)—and the man
was discharged; coffee kernels are queer things to
recognise.
   Witness—Some of that last lot (No. 2) looks like
Maracaibo coffee.
   Noah—I should like to see those different kinds, so
as to be able to know them again.
   Recorder—You know the taste of a good cup of
coffee, brother Noah, when you drink it?
   Noah—Yes, and wine, too.
   Witness—I can't swear to the coffee, nor no one
hardly, all coffee looks so much alike; some Mara-
caibo resembles La Guayra some, and vice versa;
some La Guayra is like some Maracaibo.
   Noah—But damaged coffee don't look like good
coffee.
   Witness—Not exactly.
   Noah—And yet you coffee roasters mix them up
together. It's a great imposition upon the public.
   <i>One of the Judges</i>—That's worse than stealing
coffee.
   Whiting—You were a friend of Ritchie's?
   Answer—I used to take a ride out of town with
him sometimes.
   Whiting—On a Sunday?
   Answer—I don't go riding on a Sunday; I go to
church. (Laughter.)
   Whiting—A very good place.
   Cross-examination continued—James Ritchie ne-
ver said the coffee I bought belonged to him. The
coffee I bought of them was very dirty, so that I had
to sift it.
   Noah—And yet it was all worked up, and sold to
the public?
   Answer—Yes.
   Robert Ballyntine sworn—Married Carter's daugh-
ter; lived at 38 Macdougal street; saw James Ritchie
there to tea once; never saw any coffee in the cel-
lar; Ritchie had no control over the cellar, or any
part of the premises. Never saw Ritchie in the base-
ment; never saw him with any coffee any where.
Griffin and Tom Ritchie came there once.
   Noah—Did Tom Ritchie take tea there?
   Answer—Yes.
   Elizabeth Ballyntine, (a very pretty English girl)
sworn—Lived with my father 38 Macdougal street;
James Ritchie was there once to take tea; I never
saw any coffee there.
   Mr. Stokely sworn—I was told Griffin knew all
about this robbery, and I arrested him; he offered to
turn state's evidence and directed me to the <u title="cellar">celler</u> in
Macdougal street; I went there and found coffee
grains mixed up in the sand and about a peck that
had run into a hole in the ground; there were
also some pieces of bags, but no marks on them; that
coffee in the paper (No. 1) is part of what I found
there; it looked as if coffee had been mixed in that
cellar.
   Cross-examined—Who arrested Griffin?
   Answer—Cockefair.
   Question—I thought it was you?
   Answer—No, I didn't arrest Griffin.
   Question—How long after he was arrested before
he promised to turn state's evidence?
   Answer—A day and a half.
   Question—Had you a search warrant when you
went to Macdougal street?
   Answer—No.
   Noah [surprised]—No search warrant? That's not
according to law.
   [Here there was a terrible cry from a woman in the
prison yard of “Let me alone<u title="!”]">!]</u>
   Shaler—Didn't you speak to Griffin about peach-
ing?
   Answer—Believe I did.
   Question—<u>Dont</u> you know you did?
   Answer—Yes, I did.
   Question—Then why <u>dont</u> you say so? Do you
know Ritchie's wife?
   Noah—Who? Tom Ritchie's wife?
   Shaler—I mean Griffin's wife.
   Answer—Yes.
   Noah—Oh.
   Question—Have you been to see her since his
arrest?
   Answer—Once.
   Noah—With the wife?
   Answer—Yes.
   Noah—Oh.
   Shaler—Didn't you take tea with her?
   A.—No, I hadn't that honor.
   Q.—Was there not some difference between her
and Ritchie?
   A.—I believe there was.
   Q.—Didn't she say that Tom Ritchie tried to ravish
her?
   Noah—(astonished)—What! Where! Who did
Tom Ritchie try to ravish?
   Witness—No, sir, it was Peter Ritchie she said
tried to ravish her.
   Shaler—Another brother, your honor.
   Noah—Gentlemen, be careful, or you'll confuse us
with this good woman and the Ritchies. Tom
Ritchie has got enough to answer for without the
charge of ravishing Mrs. Griffin.
   Shaler—Didn't the Grand Jury discharged the bill?
   Witness—I believe they did.
   Q.—Well, now, sir, wasn't he discharged?
   A.—Yes.
   Q.—Well, how could he have been discharged
unless by the Grand Jury?
   A.—Well, that's one way of getting discharged.
   Shaler—Well, that's what lawyers call getting
discharged. What other way is there?
   A.—Why, another way is to get 'em habeas'd—
(at this hit at Shaler's <i>penchant</i> the room rang with
laughter, in which Noah joined, until his spectacles
fell off and his wig almost followed suit.)
   Witness—We <u>knows</u> when a <s>man</s> gets arrested,
but it's difficult to tell when he gets discharged.—
(Laughter.)
   Noah—That's a bad way.
   <u>Morrell</u>—That's not the only bad thing about our
police and criminal courts.
   Whiting—We'll get them all reformed in time.
   Mr. Merle was again called to stand to endea-
vor to identify the coffee; but the amount of his
statement on this point was, that as all coffee was
mostly mixed up in the dealers' hands, it was next
to an impossibility to identify it.
   Mr. Colgate Gilbert was examined.—I have a cof-
fee and spice warehouse in Dutch street. A man
last summer came to me and asked me to go to
James Ritchie's store to look at some coffee. I
went—it was damaged coffee, smoked, and was
black. I bought from three to five bags of him. It
was all open—spread on the floor. I can't remem-
ber what I gave for it.
   Coffee shown to witness.
   Witness—Well, it might look something like that
coffee; but it's difficult to say about coffee, it's so
much mixed up.
   Noah—Ay, that's the tricks of the dealers and
roasters. (Laughter.)
   Morrill—I think they ought to be roasted for it.—
(Laughter.)
   Noah—You bought that damaged coffee—several
bags?
   A.—Yes.
   Q.—And mixed it up, roasted and sold it?
   A.—Yes, it was roasted and sold.
   Lynch—And so the community get shaved by bad
coffee.
   Whiting—We're not on trial for selling bad coffee.
We rest, sir.
			F<small>OR THE</small> D<small>EFENCE</small>.
   Geo. Rankin was brought out of prison and sworn.
(He is a tall six-foot Irish boy.) I never went with
Griffin to steal coffee. I never stole a grain of coffee
from any one. I never knew of any being stolen.
   Noah—How old are you?
   Ans.—I am 18 and 6 months, and a little better.
   Noah—You want to be more than a little better.
But only 18 and such a strapping fellow?
   Shaler—He's one of our genuine “dimmikrats”,
and they grow fast.
   Noah—Yes, ill weeds always grow space; and
that's the case with the locofocos. (Laughter.)
   Whiting—Not always, your Honor.
   Examination continued—I never was at Merle's
store in the night. Never put any coffee over the
fence.
   Whiting—But you're indicted for it, <u>aint</u> you.
   A.—I don't know what an indictment means.—
(Laughter.)—James Ritchie never told me to steal—
never threatened to shoot me if I didn't. Never paid
me to steal it, and I never did steal any. I always
had money of my own; and I brought money to this
country, bad luck to it. I made a statement in the
polices because Mr. Hicks told me to charge it all on
the Ritchies that they stole the coffee and I was so
<i>bewildered</i> with being in jail for first time I was born—
so I didn't know what I <u>wur</u> doing. (Laughter.)
   Noah, (aside)—That's too often the case with the
locofocos.
   Morrill—Yes, and the Conservatives, too.
   James Beach sworn—Was a porter in Ritchie's
store. Never saw any but damaged coffee there.
No coffee was ever concealed. I was there every
morning when the store was opened. Sometimes
James Ritchie sent the key down by Tom or Peter.
James bought eight or ten bags of damaged coffee
after the fire. I saw no coffee sent away in bags.
He didn't keep a horse and wagon. There was an
entrance to Griffin's loft, outside the house, by some
stairs. James Ritchie talked of turning Griffin out
of there.
   Capt. Smith <u>swore</u>—Known James Ritchie a year.
Always considered him an honest man. He pur-
chased a large quantity of coffee after the fire; it
was at the corner of South and Dover streets.
<d>[Col.6]</d>
   John <u>Gilmartine</u> sworn—Let the store to Tom and
James Ritchie. Tom made the agreement. I let a
loft to James to dry some damaged coffee in; the
loft was fifteen feet long; coffee was spread all over
it, and was eight inches deep. There must have
been from 3000 to 5000 weight there.
   Mr. Hicks was recalled, and denied telling Ran-
kin to charge the robbery on the Ritchies.
   He was asked to identify the coffee here pro-
duced, but said there were so many varieties, and so
much of mixing, that it was impossible to tell. The
coffee here produced, looked, he thought, like Java
coffee.
   Here, it will be remembered, that the various
witnesses had designated the sample before the
court successively as Java Coffee, <u title="La Guayra (above)">Laguayra</u> coffee,
Rio coffee and Maracaibo coffee.
   Tom Ritchie was sworn—He was a handsome,
honest looking sailor.
   Shaler—What's your name?
   Answer—Thomas Ritchie, some call me. Tom
Ritchie, I call myself.
   Noah—Oh, that's Tom Ritchie at last. He's a
much better looking man than citizen Ritchie.
   Witness—I hired that store of Mr. <u>Gilmartin</u>.
James advanced the money out of what my uncle in
Scotland left us all—my share was $780. I've been
in this country from a boy. I've been a sailor pretty
much all my life. I've been a mate of a vessel. My
brother never employed Griffin or Rankin to steal
coffee; he bought a large lot of coffee from Justice
Hopson after the fire. I spread the coffee out on the
shed myself to dry. We were often spilling coffee
about round the premises. I used to buy the coffee
sweepings from the mates of vessels, and sell it to the
coffee roasters.
   Noah—And they sell it for the best, I suppose?
   Tom (laughing).— I s'pose so, your honor; they
do a good many worse tricks than that on shore.
   Shaler—Particularly the clothes men along Water
and Chatham streets.
   Tom—I've bought bags of coffee myself—some
from the brig Grecian. I swapped a boat away for
a lot of coffee once. My brother has bought coffee
several times. I had the control of that store. He
just see to how the money was laid out, and what
profits there was on to it, and give 'em to me. But
I was going to leeward fast; we lost $560 in a few
months, and he's got my note for the half, $280. My
brother was in the British Commercial office, 35
Cornhill.
   Whiting—Now, Tom, can't you tell us how that
coffee was got out of that loft?
   Tom—(Bluntly but pleasantly.) No.
   Whiting—Didn't you have a hand in it?
   Tom—Why, Mr. Whiting, you know you tried me
for stealing it, and tried hard to convict me, but you
didn't do it; and so if I had I think you'd a done it;
and as you didn't, I <u>dont</u> think you've any right to
ask me, and I don't think I've any right to answer
you. (Roars of laughter followed this frank effu-
sion from Tom.)
   Whiting—Very well, then Tom, you think so?
   Tom—Yes, Mr. Whiting, I know so. [laughter]
   Whiting—Did you take any coffee up to that cel-
lar in Macdougal street?
   Tom—Yes, Mr. Whiting, I did; and I bought it
honestly. I took it there to mix the good and bad
all up together; because the first lot we sold Mr.
Gillies he complained that it was bad and damaged;
and so after it was mixed he couldn't tell the differ-
ence. [laughter]
   Noah—Oh, that's the way they cheat the public
in coffee, Tom, is it?
   Tom—Yes, your honor, that's the way they fix off
the coffee; and if nobody never cheated the public
no worse nor that, they'd be a darned right better off
than they are now. [roars of laughter]
   Whiting—<u>Havn't</u> you said you had that coffee?
   Tom—Yes; I said so, because nobody had a right
to ask me.
   Whiting—<u>Havn't</u> you told Mr. Merle that you
stole it?
   Tom—Let Mr. Merle tell what I told him; and if
he tells the truth I'll own to it.
   Whiting—That's all.
   The testimony here closed. The case was ably
summed up, particularly by John A. Morrill. The
Recorder's charge was short, impartial, and the case
went to the jury about 7 o'clock. The Jury, after be-
ing absent but a very short time, returned a verdict
of G<small>UILTY</small>.

   We had a man convicted here, last week, of rape,
committed under the most revolting circumstances.
The victim was the wife of a very respectable me-
chanic in Moyamensing. The perpetrator, who is
a most hard-featured villain, will probably be allowed
several years in the Penitentiary, to cool his pas-
sions. Talking of women, there has been a good
deal of excitement in certain quarters lately, in re-
ference to an attempt made by one of our notorious
young bucks, on a young lady connected with a
well known millinery establishment, in Chesnut
street. I have not been able to obtain the particu-
lars, as the friends of the creature in pantaloons are
attempting to smother the matter.
   We have a large number of navy officers here,
who having nothing else to do, are much given to
this sort of business. One of them actually grasped
the arm of a most beautiful girl, at her own door,
some time ago; whereupon her brother making his
appearance, gave his cowardly hide a dusting, which
he will remember for many a long day. We have
now established here a paper called the Censor,
which gives information long needed to strangers,
as to the most desirable lodging places for the weary
traveller. It answers the same purpose here that the
Advocate of Moral Reform does in New York.

	COURT OF SESSIONS—Y<small>ESTERDAY</small>.
			<m9>[Reported for the Sun.]</m9>
   Before the Recorder, Judges Lynch <u title="and">an</u> Noah,
and Aldermen Pollock and Lee.
   Much of the time of the Court yesterday was
occupied in hearing motions for the postponement
of trials, amongst which was one made by Mr.
Price, in the case of Ann Foster, a well dressed
elderly lady, who was put to the bar charged with
passing a number of counterfeit bills. The trial
was set down for this day.
   The grand jury come into court and presented
a number of bills.
   R<small>ECEIVING</small> S<small>TOLEN</small> G<small>OODS</small>.—James Ritchie
was then put to the bar, charged with receiving
171 bags of coffee, value upwards of $2000, know-
ing the same to be stolen.
   The particulars of this case have been fre-
quently before the public. The coffee was stolen
from the store of Mr. Merle in Front street, and
a brother of this prisoner was some time ago tried
on an indictment charging him with participation
in the robbery, and acquitted.
   The principal witness against the prisoner was
George Griffin (state's evidence) who swore that
he, George Rankin and Thomas Ritchie the broth-
er of the prisoner, went repeatedly to the store of
Mr. Merle, which they entered at night through
one of the windows, by means of a ladder—that
several bags of coffee were stolen and removed to
the house of the prisoner, who kept a junk store
next to Mr. Merle's store.
   Rankin was brought out of the Tombs, and
placed on the stand; he, however, denied knowing
anything at all about the transaction, although on
his examination when committed he had made
statements corroborative of the testimony of
Griffin.
   Evidence was adduced to prove that the prison-
er sold large quantities of coffee to venders in Fifth
street, and Dutch street.
   Officer Stokely was produced to show that
quantities of coffee were found strewed about the
rear of the premises of Mr. Merle.
   Mr. Merle could not identify any of the coffee
which was traced to the possession of the prisoner,
as that which had been stolen from his store.
   For the defence a Captain Smith was called,
who deposed that the prisoner was in the habit of
purchasing quantities of damaged coffee.
   Several other witnesses of respectability were
called and testified to the good character and ho-
nesty of the prisoner.
   Mr. Shaler addressed the Jury very ably and
eloquently for the prisoner's defence.
   Mr. Whiting replied and summed up for the pro-
secution.
   The Recorder briefly charged the Jury, who re-
tired for deliberation.
   After an absence of two hours the Jury return-
ed with a verdict finding the prisoner guilty.

	<b>Theatricals in the United States.</b>
	...
   The queen of dance, Fanny Elssler, has returned
to this city, after a tour to Havana and the Southern
and Western States, by which she realised $45,000.
She received $1000 a night in Havana, and receives
$600 her, during this engagement. Her popularity
has not diminished in the slightest degree; the
house Monday night was crowded to suffocation, and
the enthusiasm and applause rises higher and higher
with every successive performance.

			<b>General Sessions.</b>
Present, the Recorder, Judges Noah, Lynch, and two
			Aldermen.
   <i>Second Trial of Ritchie</i>.—James Ritchie, convicted on
Monday of receiving stolen coffee, was put to the bar on
an indictment of grand larceny, in stealing 30 morocco
skins, the property of Jacob Riberdale, No. 9, Jacob
street.
   The prosecution deposed, that in the early part of No-
vember last he lost about thirty skins, French dressed.
	...
   The Jury returned under the charge of the Court and
convicted Ritchie of the charge as laid in the indictment.
   <i>Riot</i>.—Henry Strickland, Charles Brown, William La-
tham, Stebbins Andrews, Nathaniel Reeder, Wm. El-
more, Mike Kelly, and Edward Wall, were all put on
trial, charged with perpetrating a political riot in the 7th
ward, at the late election.
   This case was heard by the late Recorder in the early
part of the year, and the jury did not agree. The same
testimony was read to the jury, and they convicted all
except Edward Wall.
   The Court then adjourned.

   C<small>ORRECTION</small>.—Horace <u>Greely</u> never paid the U. S.
District Attorney $80 for the compromise of a suit
against him, for a violation of the Post Office laws.
He only offered to pay $15 or $20, but even that has
not been squeezed out of the “squash.” Let him
be galvanized, and then squeeze.

<b>Another Curious Scene in the Court of Ses-
   sions, in which Noah, the New Judge in
   Israel, figures largely.</b>
   No stranger should leave this city without pay-
ing a visit to that strange assemblage of stupidity,
good sense, cupidity, wit, folly, dirt, rascality, ob-
stinacy, and bad smells, called the Court of Sessions.
Of which of these Noah is the presiding deity, we
shall not at present undertake to say.
   The Court, as at present constituted, by Heaven
knows whom, is the most singular and unique one
ever seen beneath the sun. There is on the bench a
Protestant, an Israelite, a Catholic, a Nothingarian,
and, we believe, a Presbyterian, or an Anything-
arian. There is one sensible man, and sound law-
yer, one ridiculous old fool, one thick-headed
fellow, with a great deal of pretension to legal
knowledge, but with a less amount of whole-
some brains than a terrapin; one good jolly look-
ing fellow, apparently born abroad, and with a
countenance that might induce any malicious rascal
to accuse him of having a bad temper; and one lit-
tle lean, hungry-looking, lizard-like, kind of well
disposed little man, that might be taken for a repre-
sentative of those lean kine described by Pharaoh,
which swallowed up several other kine; not swine,
or Noah certainly would not sit next to him.
   The Court (as understood by a large majority of
the honest men in this city) is legally composed of
the Recorder, F. A. Tallmadge, Esq., a very able and
sound lawyer, and two Aldermen elected by the
people. There are also two excrescences forced upon
the Court by a few fools at Albany against the will
of the people, (but who will be removed the instant
the next legislature meets,) in the persons of Mr.
Lynch, an indifferent lawyer, and the notorious M.
M. Noah, a broken down politician—neither of
whom are recognised by the corporation.
   The Sessions room is dirty, uncomfortable, and
miserably constructed. The Recorder and the four
so-called Judges, are all stuck up on a row like so
many hens on a hen-roost, so that this Court has not
been inappropriately called the “HENROOST
COURT.” A dirty semi-circular table is placed in
front of the Henroost bench, which is covered with
old hats and sleeves of old coats, with arms in them,
and generally surrounded by loafers, and a few law-
yers. Between this half moon table and the hen-
roost bench is placed a miserably old dirty, filthy,
round table, 2½ feet in diameter, and at which only
three persons can sit without inconvenience, which
no one would sit at with a decent coat on, and which
is too low in the legs for any but a boy to sit at in
any way, and this is dignified with the name of the
“R<small>EPORTER'S</small> T<small>ABLE</small>.”
   Of all this the greatest joke is, the new Judge in
Israel—or Israelitish Judge in Christendom, M. M.
Noah. Since he has been appointed to the office of
Judge, he has lost his melancholy agitated cast of
countenance, become more slippery and cunning
and conceited than ever, reads the newspapers on
the bench, and talks, and laughs, and retails old
jokes—not old clothes—and manages the affairs of
the nation and petty larceny rascals through the
columns of the “Evening Star.”
   Yesterday presented an excruciatingly amusing
scene of excitement in the Court of Sessions. Judge
Noah was in a state of hysterics—his very wig mov-
ing alive with indignation.
   When the Judge was appointed to the Christian
bench, we said his appointment would be worth a
thousand a year. So it is rapidly becoming. Here
is the first order of the afflicted:—
<m9>	J<small>UDGE</small> N<small>OAH'S</small> O<small>RDER IN</small> C<small>OURT</small>.
   At the opening of the Court of General Sessions,
yesterday morning, Judge Noah said he had been
shown a report in the Morning Herald, purporting
to be the proceedings in this Court, which was a tis-
sue of misrepresentations from beginning to end. It
was due to myself to say, that not a single remark
which had fallen from myself was correctly re-
ported. Owing to a similarity of name between the
person on trial, and Mr. Ritchie, of the Richmond
Enquirer, the reporter, William H. Attree, had so
framed certain questions, and put the answers there-
to in the mouth of one of the Judges, (myself,) as to
make it appear that I had intentionally insulted that
gentleman; now I take this opportunity of stating
that I have the greatest respect for <i>that</i> Mr. Ritchie;
and that, while uniting with this Court in permitting
the utmost freedom to the press, yet we cannot tole-
rate this species of misrepresentations. The Court
has, therefore, made the following order, (Recorder
Tallmadge excepting):—
   “The report in this morning's Herald, purporting
to be an account of the proceedings of the Court in
the trial of James Ritchie, being a tissue of misre-
presentations calculated to reflect on the character of
the Court, and bring the cause of justice and deco-
rum into disrepute, it is hereby ordered that the re-
porter, <i>William H. Attree</i>, be hereafter excluded
from having a seat, <small>AS SUCH</small>, <i>at the reporters' table of
this Court</i>.”</m9>
   As this is the first time we have come in contact with
the Judge since he left off dealing in old clo' and old
sayings, we're not much afraid of him, or his order,
or all his law learning. We shall issue, therefore, a
counter order, to the following effect:—
<m9>		O<small>RDER OF</small> E<small>DITOR</small> B<small>ENNETT</small>.
   Judge N<small>OAH</small> having, without regard to the Con-
stitution or the laws of Moses, without even a trial
according to the Anglo Saxon laws, excluded Wm.
H. Attree from the reporter's seats of the Court of Ses-
sions, we, the editor of the New York Herald, hereby
order the useful sprite Ariel from paradise, to attend
daily the Sessions, and to take his seat daily on the
tip of Judge Noah's wig, and to report faithfully the
“saying and doings” of the Judge, be they silly or
otherwise, down to the very movements of each
particular hair of the selfsame wig. We know very
well the difficulty of reporting Judge Noah with per-
fect accuracy, because, being a descendant of the
stock of Judas Iscariot, he is as slippery as an eel,
and as witty as an owl, but we have no doubt
enough of him will be caught to show forth his pe-
culiar attainments, so that the world may be en-
lightened by his vast surplus stock of wisdom and
black letter law learning.
   And furthermore, it is our firm belief that if the
administration of justice is to be brought into fur-
ther disrepute (a very doubtful thing) it will arise
from the folly of Governor Seward in placing on a
Christian bench, one of the race of Barabbas, who
knows as little of any Christian legal code, as he does
of the Gospel itself. And again it is very amusing
certainly to see this Judge talk of the respect he en-
tertains for “Citizen Ritchie”—a man whom he has
been assailing in his “Evening Star,” ever since his
own opinion on the U. S. Bank was very conveni-
ently changed at the time he received a slice of the
$52,000 in 1830.
   We therefore direct our reporter, the aforesaid
elegant Ariel of heavenly memory, to report Noah
each day, to report him from the tip of his wig to the
toe of his boots. The community want something
to amuse them in this warm weather. We know
the difficulty of reporting correctly such a slippery old
chap—but the best that can be done shall be done.
Noah will give more public entertainment in our re-
ports, than he ever did as editor—as orator on Grand
Island—or as politician and office beggar. So look
out for fun, absurdity and law mixed up together.
   And furthermore and finally, I hereby order, that
Judge Noah—the same Judge who issued the pro-
clamation for assembling the Jews at Grand Island
—the same Noah who attempted to make pure
wine for the Christian communion table, out of old
and musty raisins—that he is hereby prohibited each
and every morning, from reading the classic columns
of the Herald, and that every carrier and newsboy
is instructed not to sell Noah any Herald, for love,
money, or old clo'—and that the newsboys, if Noah
should beg to buy a paper, are hereby instructed to put
their right thumb on the nose, extend the four fingers
toward the east, making a gyration in the air, and
uttering, at the same time, these solemn words, “ba—
ba—ba—ba.”</m9>
   Again—A few days ago a highly respectable loafer
with a long beard, and abundance of old clothes on his
back, (though not a descendant from Judas Iscariot,
or the tribe of Barabbas,) but having a very respecta-
ble hole in his breeches, was brought up before this
dirty, bad smelling Court—we mean Court room—
and arraigned on a charge of stealing three pounds
of pork, price three shillings.
   As soon as the Recorder heard the charge, which
Noah, who was busy with the newspapers, did not
hear, he said, “Mr. District Attorney, this seems
to be a very small affair; why don't you send this
man to the Special Sessions? It's only three shil-
lings.”
   The District Attorney, also a remarkably sensible,
shrewd, and honest man, but who loves dearly to
crack a joke at the expense of Mr. Noah and Mr.
Lynch, replied, “The man wants to be tried by this
Court, for stealing his pork!” laying particular em-
phasis on the word “pork,” with a sly wink at Noah.
   On this, Judge Noah, who is so fat, and sleek, and
slippery, that he frequently almost tumbles asleep on
the bench, or looks like it, which is much the same,
<d>[Col.3]</d>
roused himself up, and cried out, “pork! pork!
what's that about pork?”
   The Recorder, who also loves a joke as dearly as
any man living, and who frequently laughs in his
sleeve at the ignorance of law displayed by his asso-
ciates, turned round to Noah, and observed, “Bro-
ther Noah, as this case of stealing pork seems to lay
legitimately on your side of the bench, suppose you
try it.”
   “Pork! pork!” said Noah, “who'd ever think of
stealing pork?”
   “This man is charged with stealing pork, may it
please your honor,” said the District Attorney, <u title="laying">lay-</u>
particular stress upon the word “honor.”
   Noah, to the trembling loafer in the old clothes,
with the hole in his breeches, “How came you to
steal pork?”
   Loafer.—I don't know that I did.
   Mr. Noah.—But you're indicted for it.
   Loafer.—(Leisurely.)—Why I went into the store
to buy some butter and potatoes, and I paid for 'em,
and somehow or other I thought I paid for that pork.
(Roars of laughter.)—Noah frowned.
   Noah.—Paid for pork—paid for pork. (Laughter.)
Why, who ever heard of paying for pork? I never
paid for any pork in my life. Nobody ought to buy
pork. Nobody ought to touch pork.
   Loafer.—Well, I'm very fond of pork. (Laughter
among the loafers.)
   Noah.—Pshaw! You ought to suffer some for your
folly and bad taste. Found of pork? Faugh! (Laugh-
ter.)
   Loafer.—Well, that's all a matter of taste. (Laugh-
ter.)
   The evidence was then heard, and it being but
very slight, and the Judge in Israel, not liking, as
we presume, to recognize the stealing of pork as a
punishable offence, he at last dismissed the loafer,
with a solemn request never to touch pork again, and
amid roars of laughter from the bystanders.

	GENERAL SESSIONS.
   Upon the opening of the Court the following order
was unanimously adopted, and directed to be placed
upon the minutes:
   The report in this morning's Herald, purporting
to be an account of the proceedings of this Court, in
the trial of James Ritchie being a tissue of misre-
presentations, calculated to reflect on the character
of the Court, and bring the cause of justice and deco-
rum into disrepute, it is hereby
   Ordered that the reporter <i>William H. Attree</i>, be
hereafter excluded from having a seat, as such, at the
reporter's table of this Court.
   James Ritchie was for the second time put to the
bar for trial, on charge of grand larceny, in stealing
a quantity of morocco skins, value $61. Ample proof
of his guilt was produced by the prosecution, and the
jury found him guilty.
   In the case of Robert Bolton, indicted for grand
larceny, a number of affidavits were produced, tend-
ing to show that the accused was subject to fits of
<u title="aberration">abberation</u> of mind, and which was probably the
case at the time the alluded offence was committed.
By consent of the District Attorney, the Court di-
rected a <i>nol. pros.</i> to be entered and Bolton was dis-
charged.
	...
   <i>Inquest</i>.—The Coroner yesterday held an Inquest
on the body of an unknown man, found floating in
the dock foot of Canal street, North River—Verdict,
found drowned.
			—————
   <i>Park Theatre</i>—Mademoiselle Elssler appears again
this evening in the same dance, and same character,
“Nathalie,” in which she performed on Monday
evening. From the appearance of the Box sheet
there is every prospect of another crowded audience,
comprising the beauty and fashion of our city.
   <i>Bowery Theatre</i>.—The “Mother Goose” panto-
mime “takes” so well at the Bowery, that every
seat in the dress circle has been taken for this and
to-morrow evening. The Swiss Brothers and Miss
Lee are now the <i>legitimate pantomimists</i>. The trage-
dy of Hamlet opens the performances at the Bowery
this evening. Hamlet by Mr. Hamblin.

Peck slip, near Water st., (late Dr. Evans') is still con-
tinued for the safe, speedy and effectual treatment and
cure of diseases. If age, science, and an extensive expe-
rience entitles the practitioner to preference over the mere
tyro in the healing art, the proprietor of 12 Peck slip begs
leave to direct the attention of a discerning public to the
inference of the comparison. Be particular in the number
12, on red signs—there is no Dr. Evans at No. 9, or in the
city of New York, all signs, handbills, and notices to the
contrary notwithstanding. A plurality of offices or rooms

F<small>OREMOST AT THE</small> S<small>YNAGOGUE</small>.—An election took
place for trustees at the Synagogue in Crosby street
on Tuesday. Noah was a candidate for one of the
Board. One of his antagonists was Mr. Lazarus, a
highly respectable Hebrew. Noah fixed on his wig
and old breeches and tried to run into the office, but
Mr. Lazarus left the Judge far behind, the latter hav-
ing lost his wig and specs in the race.
   We congratulate the Crosby street people that
they have not permitted an old political loafer to su-
perintend the affairs of that holy place. Noah's
piety lays in his breeches' pocket.

   R<small>ETURN OF</small> C<small>OL</small>. S<small>TONE</small>.—Col. Stone returned yes-
terday from Washington, where he has been for a
week, boring for a diplomatic place for himself, and
the post office here, for a politician called Havens.
He was equally successful in both. We advise
Stone to quit office begging, animal magnetism,
huge eating, and all such vanities. Go to work—
and attend to your newspaper.
			—————
   F<small>URTHER</small> P<small>ROGRESS OF THE</small> E<small>LSSLER</small> M<small>ANIA</small>.—
Last evening was rather cool and pleasant in the
Park—but in the Park theatre the thermometer stood
at 110 at least.
   Fanny Elssler appeared again last night at this
theatre, and, as usual, it was crammed from pit to
<u>Shakspeare</u>, besides running over at the doors.
There is no diminution of the <i>mania</i>. The whole
theatrical floating interests of the legitimate drama
—with the exception of Thorne of the Chatham,
which has also its own mania—are devising ways
and means among the small critics to get up a “mo-
ral war” against Fanny, but it seems to be no go. She
carries everything before her, and the “squashes”
too.
			—————
   C<small>OURT OF</small> S<small>ESSIONS</small>.—The proceedings in this mis-
erable hole yesterday, which is called by some the
“Henroost Court,” were of little interest. George
Rankin, the witness introduced in Noah's celebrated
trial, was tried and convicted of burglary, in break-
ing into and stealing coffee from Mr. Merle's store.
And the notorious old stool-pigeon, Butcher Joe, the
last of the race, was convicted of robbing Mr. Sea-
grave of Providence, R. I. of $710, in March last, in
Broadway.
   A motion was made and argued at some length by
W. H. Attree, that the Court do rescind the order
made in relation to him the day before, because it
was, as the Recorder said, informal, i. e. illegal—
done without evidence or notice to show cause;
<i>was written by Noah, and sanctioned by him and Lynch
alone</i>, the Recorder considering it informal, and the
two Aldermen dissenting from it. The Court will
doubtless take time to consider of it, before they ex-
punge their illegal and ridiculous act. We shall
give full particulars hereafter.
   Mr. M. M. Noah, the so-called Judge (for a very
short period,) shook like an <u title="aspen">aspin</u> leaf and was as
red as an old turkey hen the whole day on account
of what appeared in the “Herald.” He denied, like
a false old fool as he is, that he had any thing to do
with the “Star,” and said nothing till towards night,
when he fell asleep. Mr. Lynch looked ridiculous
the whole day, and was laughed at by Tallmadge,
Whiting, the Aldermen, and all the lawyers for his
folly.
			—————
   F<small>URNITURE FOR THE</small> R<small>USSIAN</small> S<small>TEAMER</small>.—There are
now to be seen at Charles A. Baudouine's, No 332
Broadway, several articles of furniture—the richest
and the most sumptuous we ever saw. They were
manufactured by Mr. Baudouine for his Imperial Ma-
jesty of Russia, and will decorate the two drawing
rooms of the steam frigate “<u title="Kamchatka">Kamschatska</u>,” now
nearly ready for sea.
   The principal articles are two sofas, eight drawing
room chairs, four large arm chairs, four <u title="tabourets">tabourettes</u>,
and two large circular tables. These are all in the
antique style, and made of the costliest rose wood,
highly polished. The chairs and sofas are covered
with light blue satin damask, delicately figured.
They are stuffed with eider down, and have spring
bottoms. The tops of the tables, which are very
large and massive, are each of one slab of marble of
Parian whiteness. Each article has a superb cover-
ing of cloth, which looks more like leopard skin than
anything else. Nothing of the kind so splendid was
ever made before. All go on board in a day or two.
M. de Bodisco, the Russian Minister, is highly pleased
with their beauty and finish.
   The drawing rooms of the steam frigate into which
these go, are to be fitted up in a beautiful and unique
style, to correspond with the furniture. It is said
they will be used by the Imperial family only.
   We understand that the “<u>Kamschatska</u>” will be
finished next month, and take an experimental trip
to the south. She will then return, take in coal, and
start for St. Petersburg. As a steam vessel, she will
be the most complete of any on the water, and we
have it as the opinion of scientific and experienced
naval men, that no other vessel will equal her in
speed. Her decorations will be superb, and her ar-
mament powerful. In a work, she is a nonesuch,
and we have every reason to feel proud of her as a
production of this Republic.

<l9>   T<small>HE</small> N<small>EW</small> Y<small>ORK</small> S<small>UN</small>.—How can any Christian
patronize this vile print? Look at its constant ad-
vertisements of Madame Restell, and others of a
similar character, which render it unfit to be re-
ceived into any decent family. Look at its base
attack recently upon Methodist Class Meetings.
And last Saturday it came out in a scurrilous at-
tack upon the friends of freedom, denouncing
them as a set of “addle-pated fanatics.” We call
on all friends of virtue to set their faces against
that print, as utterly unworthy of their support.
					[Zion's Watchman.</l9>
   We copy the above, not because we deem it of
the least importance to expose or refute the base
falsehoods which it utters or insinuates against us;
these, with a thousand others like them, conceived
in the same spirit, “pass by us like the idle wind.”
Indeed it gives us pleasure, as far as we are indi-
vidually concerned, to meet these spiteful attacks
from fanatics, hypocrites, and corrupt partizans,
who allow themselves to be “the tools with which
knaves do worth withal.” When we are attacked
from such quarters, it gives us strong assurance
tha we are doing our duty to the public, that truth
is making its way in triumph, while error is writh-
ing beneath the blows that are inflicted upon it.—
But we copy the above paragraph for the purpose
of showing the public, and especially the Chris-
tian public, the character of a paper that pretends
to minister to them in holy things. This quintes-
sence of “envy, hatred, malice, and all uncharita-
bleness,” comes from a journal which professes to
teach the religion of the “meek and lowly Jesus”
—a paper which claims to be a watchman on the
towers of Zion. Will not the Prince of Darkness
laugh to find the gates in the keeping of <i>such</i>
Watchmen?
   In the same paper we find the benevolent and
humane efforts of the Colonization Society de-
nounced with more bitterness than the Sun. It
says, “the infinite God looks with utter abhor-
rence upon this scheme.” But worse than this,
the same paper contains an article calling upon all
the churches to drive away from the holy sacra-
ment of the Lord's supper all professing chris-
tians who are slaveholders! And it is recommen-
ded to commence this impious work immediately,
“this summer—this week if you can,”—while the
Southern slaveholders are travelling at the North!
Finally it contains the abolition nomination of
James G. <u title="Birney (in Wikipedia)">Birnie</u> for President of these United
States in 1844.
	...
If hypocrites who claim to be Zion's watchmen
continue to impose upon the Christian public, it
shall not be because we neglect to expose their
falsehoods. If political demagogues, who support
the little interests of faction rather than the great
interests of the country, are countenanced by a
cajoled and cheated people, it will not be because
we shall cease to proclaim the truth, fearless and
free. So we give a fair warning to all these mad-
caps of what we intend to do; and if they intend to
put us down they had better be stirring them-
selves, for our subscription list is increasing ra-
pidly every day.

has joined the Temperance Society, and signed the

<b>Judge Noah's Order in Court—The Argument
		in relation thereto.</b>
   As Judge Noah took particular pains to write him-
self the order in relation to one of the gentlemen in
the employ of the proprietor of this paper, and to see
it published, we think proper to publish the argu-
ment had in relation to the order in the Court of Ses-
sions the day after the order was promulgated.
   Almost immediately after the opening of the Court,
W. H. Attree (who had entered the Court room, and
taken his seat at the table appropriated for lawyers)
rose and said:—
   “May it please the Court; as I have been, by an
extra-judicial, and, as I consider it, an illegal action
of a part of this Court, (here Noah wriggled in his
seat,) brought as a suitor within the Court, I must
request permission to introduce a motion to rescind
the order made in relation to myself, and the further
permission to address the Court in relation thereto;
stating the reasons why I deem the said order illegal.
(Here Noah and Lynch colored up and seemed de-
termined to shirk the question if possible.)
   <i>Recorder</i>.—Certainly, Mr. Attree, you have a per-
fect right to address the Court in relation to the mat-
ter you speak of; and as it is a personal application I
see no objection to your doing so fully at once.
   (Here Noah and Lynch colored still deeper, looked
as savage as hungry bears, and both whispered the
Recorder together; and the noise and confusion in
the Court room became terrible.)
   <i>Attree</i>.—In all that I may say or have said, I dis-
tinctly disclaim any intention to treat this Court with
disrespect—the Court as I consider it, legally consti-
tuted under the City Charter; but my rights as a pri-
vate individual have been invaded by the Court; and
in my person, the rights of every individual connect-
ed with the press of this city have been invaded.—
For I believe that it will be admitted by the Court
without argument, (as it is notoriously known even
to every student at law,) that the grand fundamental
principle of the common law is that the rights of no
individual, however humble, can be touched by any
Court of Justice, unless that individual be present ei-
ther in person or by counsel to answer to the charges
preferred against him. (Murmurs of applause among
the lawyers, and remarks of “That's good law,” “He's
perfectly right.”) On this account, I insist that be-
fore this Court could issue such an illegal order as
they have done, they were by the common law and
in common justice bound to serve a notice on me to
appear and show cause why such an order should not
issue and be enforced against me. I therefore, re-
spectfully move the Court that the order made yes-
terday in relation to myself—which I find published
in the “Evening Star” (Noah colored) accompanied
with false editorial comments (Noah colored still
deeper) which I presume were written and furnished
to the “Evening Star” by one of the Judges of this
Court. (Noah became very red with rage.) I move,
I repeat, that this order be rescinded; upon the ground
that the Court had no legal evidence before them that
I wrote the report of which the Court complains; that
I was not present to answer when the order<u>;</u> was
made, and that therefore such order was informal—
that is, illegal—contrary to common sense, contrary
to sound justice and contrary to law.
   By this time Noah and Lynch had worked them-
selves into a towering passion; although from the
usual noise and confusion in Court, the shuffling of
feet, the walking to and fro, and the talking of the
lawyers, neither of them had heard above a quarter
of what the speaker had said. They both talked to
the Recorder at once, and both were evidently afraid
that the Recorder and the two Aldermen would
overrule them, and rescind the order. They there-
fore determined to shirk the question until the two
Aldermen had left the bench. For this reason Lynch
exclaimed “Mr. Attree this thing will give rise to a
good deal of discussion and it had better be postpon-
ed for the present.” They then again whispered the
Recorder, who said in a mild manner, “Mr. Attree
you have an undoubted right to be heard patiently by
the Court, and shall be heard; but as there are a
great many witnesses here who came from a dis-
tance, and one from Rhode Island, whose causes are
about to be called on, I think it will be better that
you postpone your motion until one or two of these
cases are disposed of.”
   <i>Attree</i>.—Certainly, with a great deal of pleasure;
under those circumstances I will postpone it for the
present.
   <i>Recorder</i>.—You shall have an opportunity of being
heard during the day if you wish it.
   Here the matter was suspended until the latter
part of the evening session; when, the two Alder-
men having left the bench, Mr. Attree requested the
Recorder to allow him to postpone his motion until
the morning, so that the Aldermen might be present.
Noah and Lynch seeing this, <u title="overruled">over-ruled</u> the Record-
er, and insisted that the motion should be brought on
then; it being nearly half past nine at night; and
Mr. Attree had been kept dancing attendance there
since half past 10 in the morning. This measure
was doubtless resorted to in consequence of the Al-
dermen stating to Mr. Attree during the day that
they had not been consulted in relation to the order,
and the Recorder also stating to Mr. A. that he con-
sidered the order an <i>informal</i> one; that it was writ-
ten by Noah, and only showed it to him, just as he
was about to take his seat on the bench; that he
disapproved of it; that he found himself <u title="overruled">over-ruled</u>
by Lynch and Noah; and that he then refused to
read the order form the bench because it was infor-
mal; and that he further said to Noah, “If you
choose to make a display of this kind you may be
your own orator, for I will not.” Under these cir-
cumstances it doubtless was that Noah and Lynch
insisted that Mr. Attree should bring his motion on
at that late hour of the evening.
   The Recorder then said,—“Mr. Attree, you were
about to address the Court in the morning in rela-
tion to a motion concerning yourself; the Court will
now hear any remarks you may have to make con-
nected with you motion.
   <i>Attree</i>—I would prefer waiting until the morning,
or until all the members of the Court are present.
   <i>Lynch</i>—There is a Constitutional Court present
now, sir.
   <i>Attree</i>—May it please the Court, I respectfully
state that I do not think so. And I believe a major-
ity of the people of this city are of the same opinion.
And I therefore respectfully request the Court to <u>al-
allow</u> me to postpone the motion till the morning.—
I regret to have troubled the Court, with any re-
quest, but if they would allow me delay—
   <i>Lynch</i> (rudely and abruptly)—There's no apology
necessary, sir; if you have nothing to say, there's
an end of it. (Noise in court.)
   <i>Attree</i>—No, may it please the Court, there's not
an end of it. I will proceed now, though conscious
that a majority of the Judges will decide against me.
But I care not about this matter, as it immediately
concerns myself. The late order of the Court, is a
matter of very little moment to me as an individual.
But, the order of the Court touched upon broad and
delicate grounds; it was an infringement of the sa-
cred liberties possessed by the press. And wherever
my lot may be cast in this life, and under whatever
clime I may be destined by a Superior Power to so-
journ for the remainder of my existence, it shall ne-
ver be said that the liberty of the press was first in-
vaded by any Court, or any power, in my person,
without a struggle on my part to strangle the act of
tyranny. (Great noise in Court.) I desire to treat
the Court with all due respect in what I say; but I
insist that the order of the Court made in relation to
myself, was illegal; it was issued without any legal
evidence being taken by the Court that I wrote the
report; this ought to have been done before the or-
der was issued; I ought to have been present, either
in person or by counsel; and therefore I declare that
the order was contrary to law and justice, and res-
pectfully move the Court that it be rescinded.
   <i>Noah</i>—But, Mr. Attree, you may remember that
on the day of that trial I called you up to the side of
this bench to have some private conversation with
you, in the course of which you remarked to me
that you were about to officiate in the place of the
regular reporter.
   <i>Attree</i>—But if I did, that is not legal evidence that
I wrote the whole or any part of the report in ques-
tion, as it was published, of which the Court com-
plains. Nor does it do away with the illegality of ma-
king such an order when I was not present. It was like
trying a man without evidence; passing sentence
and punishment on him before he had been told that
there was any charge against him. It is like the fa-
bled Jedburgh law: hang first, and try afterwards.
(Tallmadge and the lawyers laughed. Lynch and
Noah frowned; although from the noise they could
not hear distinctly.) And the Court in thus acting
were following the bad precedent set them by the
Senate of this State, on punishing by removal, a
Judge without any trial or impeachment.
   <i>Noah</i>—Well, if the Court, then, are to understand
from you that you did not write the report, and if
you will reduce that statement to an affidavit, the
Court will not hesitate to rescind the order.
   <i>Attree</i>—May it please the Court, I shall do nothing
of the kind. The Court have thought proper to as-
sume, without legal evidence, that I did write it;
they did an illegal act on that assumption; and until
the Court rescind or expunge that illegal act, I stand
by that order, for the purpose of having it expunged.
I say it with all proper respect for the Court. (The
Recorder smiled.)
   <i>Noah</i>.—Well, Mr. Attree, but you must very well
know that if you did not write the report, you can
easily satisfy the court of the fact.
   <i>Attree</i>.—And his honor, judge Noah, also very
well knows, that I shall willingly do nothing of the
kind. His honor, Judge Noah, has too recently left
the ranks of the newspaper press, where he was a
titled officer—and where, with “all's fair in po-
litics” for his motto, he was in the daily habit of
ridiculing and slandering all who differed with
him—he was a soldier in the ranks of friends and
foes too long—he marched and countermarched
too often—he knew too many of the tricks of the
trade—he was too thoroughly conversant with the
machinery that regulates a newspaper office—not to
know that whatever transpires within such an office
never transpires out of it, except upon compulsion.
(Laughter among the lawyers.) I shall, in the pre-
sent state of the case, admit nothing—I shall deny
nothing; and I shall thereby most faithfully discharge
<d>[Col.3]</d>
my duty to him by whom I am employed. I must
insist again that the Court do rescind or expunge
that order, (at the mention of the word “expunge”
the Recorder, Whiting, and the lawyers laughed,)
because it was issued without first taking legal evi-
dence on the subject.
   <i>Noah</i>.—But, Mr. Attree, the Court inferred that
you wrote the article complained of.
   <i>Attree</i>.—The Court <i>inferred</i>; does the Court mean
to say that it acts upon an inference? Do I under-
stand the Court aright, when they say that they <i>in-
ferred</i> an offence had been committed by an individ-
ual, and therefore sentenced and punished him? The
Court might in this manner infer that other gentle-
men connected with other newspapers, wrote at dif-
ferent times, the several articles censuring certain
matters connected with this Court, such as the mode
of admitting to bail, &c., and therefore exclude
those gentlemen upon an <i>inference</i>. The Court might
as well <i>infer</i> that I wrote the report of the pork case.
(Laughter.) Whereas if the Court were to look a
little nearer themselves than I am, they might make
a nearer inference. But if this Court has acted in
my case upon a mere inference,—as I believe that it
this is the first transaction of the kind upon record in
the history of this Court, so I humbly and respectful-
ly trust it will be the last.
   Here Judge Noah seemed to think that he really
had committed a gross error in point of law, and he
remained silent.
   The Recorder smiled; but as the order was infor-
mal, and did not emanate from him, he determined
not to interfere. At last Noah went on:—
   <i>Noah</i>—But, Mr. Attree, you said in your paper of
to-day that his Honor the Recorder excepted to
the order. Such was not the fact.
   <i>Attree</i>—May it please the Court, I have no pa-
per of my own, nor any part of one—I am merely
employed to write for one paper. I regret to be un-
der the necessity of contradicting any member of the
Court; but his honor the Recorder assured me with
his own lips this morning, that Judge Noah wrote
the order, that he (the Recorder) knew nothing
about it, until he came to Court and found his opi-
nion overruled by Judges Lynch and Noah—that, as
the Judges consider the Aldermen elected by the
people as mere nobodies, they were not consulted;
that he (the Recorder) endeavored to persuade
Judge Noah not to make such an order, and further
said to him, “If you choose to make this display you
may be your own orator, for I <u>wont</u>;” and that he,
(the Recorder) further considered that I ought to
have been heard—and that as I was not, the order
was an <i>informal</i> one, and the proceedings informal;
which phrase, as connected with a court of law, I
understand to mean <i>illegal</i>. There sits his honor the
Recorder—you can ask him if he did not say so.
   <i>Recorder</i>—I did state to Mr. Attree that the order
was informal; but inasmuch as the order was sanc-
tioned by a majority of the Court, it was unquestiona-
bly the order of the Court, though informal.
   Here Judge Lynch, who had had a full head of
steam on for the last few minutes, commenced.
   <i>Lynch</i>—The Court, sir, thought proper to pass that
order in relation to the reporter, as the milder course;
this Court are determined not be trifled with by any
reporter, or by any newspaper. This Court do not
need any instructions from any quarter as to what are
and what are not his duties. The Court merely per-
mit the Reporters* to come here and sit where they
do; and if they do not behave themselves and make
proper reports, the Court can either expel them, or
commit them, as it thinks proper. You must be
aware, sir, that this Court can commit any one so
offending!
   <i>Attree</i>—I am perfectly well aware that this Court
can commit any individual who is guilty of a con-
tempt of court. But I am, also, equally well aware
that this Court must have sufficient legal evidence,
that the individual complained of has been guilty of
a contempt of Court. (The Recorder and District
Attorney smiled; and the latter observed, “If you
go on so, you'll puzzle the Judge.”)
   <i>Lynch</i>.—The Court consider that they had evi-
dence enough.
   <i>Attree</i>.—I respectfully differ with the Court.
   <i>Noah</i>.—But Mr. Attree you don't mean to contend
that the report in question was a correct report.
   <i>Attree</i>.—May it please the Court, I mean respect-
fully to contend that every iota of the evidence re-
lating to the stealing and receiving the coffee was
literally and strictly true; that the report was fuller,
better, and contained more facts than any other re-
port that was published in relation to the trial; and
with the exception of a few harmless remarks put
into the mouth of Judge Noah it<u>,</u> was literally and
strictly the most correct report published. And I wish
further to say, that the editorial introduction to the
article in the “Star” in relation to this order of which
I before complained, was grossly false in speaking
of the report.
   <i>Noah</i> (angrily and abruptly)—I have nothing to do
with writing in the “Star,”—or, with the “Star.”
   <i>Attree</i> (to one of the lawyers)—I don't believe it;
and John I. Mumford says that Noah is as much the
editor of the “Star” now as ever he was.
   <i>Noah</i>—Well, this Court merely permits the report-
ers to sit at that table provided for them; and if they
violate the rules of the Court they must take the
consequences. (A laugh among some of the report-
ers.)
   <i>Lynch</i> (looking very red and very angry)—Yes,
sir, and the Court will go further; and say that it is
determined to maintain its dignity in relation to the
press and to every one else. And <i>the Court</i> consider
that the very act of the reporter, against whom the
order was made, in coming into this Court room to-
day, and taking his seat at that table, in the very
face of the order of the Court, and as it were in de-
fiance of this Court, was an act of itself sufficient to
justify this Court in committing that reporter for
contempt.
   <i>Attree</i>—Why, the Court most strangely have con-
founded the whole matter. The Court, by an illegal
act, of which I complain, written and published by
one of the Judges, brings me a suitor at the bar of this
Court, against my will. I appear here in conse-
quence, as a suitor according to law, to enter my
protest against that act; I request permission to make
my motion consequent thereon, almost the instant
that the Court opens—I renew my applications—I am
put off from hour to hour by the Court—I am kept
here by the Court dancing attendance upon them
the whole day (when I have other and much more
important business to attend to for my employer)—
and after being kept in suspense the whole day, not
knowing at what moment the Court, in their wis-
dom and magnanimity, may think proper to call on
me to make my motion, I am graciously told, at ten
o'clock at night, by this honorable Court, that I have
been guilty of a contempt of Court, and deserve to be
committed to prison for having had the audacity to
wait here the whole day, in order to be heard in self-
defence! (Here the Recorder smiled, and the law-
yers could hardly refrain from bursting out into a
most unoriental roar of laughter, particularly Mr.
Whiting.) And in addition to this, I am bound to
state that his honor the Recorder asked me this
morning to take a seat anywhere within the bar of
this Court. There sits his honor, ask him if it is not
so. (<u title="Laughter">haughter</u> all round, except by Lynch or Noah.)
   <i>Attree</i>—Such is my peculiar position here now;
and before I sit down, I will respectfully endeavor to
undeceive the Court in relation to their assumption
of my position as a member of the press, and also
that of the gentlemen who sit here connected with
other papers. This Court has spoken of “its re-
porters.” Now, so far as I understand the newspa-
per business of this city, (and I have served an ardu-
ous, a thorough, a faithful, and a devoted apprentice-
ship to it,) this Court has really no reporters at-
tached to it, properly speaking. The various gentle-
men of talent who condescend to come here day by
day, and sit for hours to be bored with miserable
speeches, bad law, and worse logic (I mean no dis-
respect to the Court) do so, as I understand them, as
a special act of favor, to rescue the Court from com-
parative insignificance, and to prevent the transactions
of this noisy, ill-conditioned, ill-contrived and disa-
greeable Court, (I say it with all proper respect for
their honors the Judges) from being consigned to
utter oblivion. They are the representatives of the
great and generous public here—they have a sacred
right to be here, decreed to them by the constitution
of the country, which no power at present existing
in this great, this (in every sense of the word) glori-
ous and blessedly-free republic, can by any distortion
of law deprive them of. And under these circum-
stances they have virtually a right to every possible
accommodation and protection from the Court.
And I beg the Court distinctly to understand, that I
make these remarks entirely disconnected from any
personal feeling in the premises. I am not a report-
er of this Court, and if it was in the power of the
Court to pass a perpetual order to exclude me
from this Court altogether, and the Court were
to do so, I should respectfully esteem it a spe-
cial act of favor. So far as I alone am concerned,
the order of the Court is a matter of comparative
indifference to me. But so far as I am a member of
that press whose rights I consider have been violated
in my person, it is a matter of great moment to me.
It is the principle which I contend for. It is the
rights of every newspaper in the city that I wish to
call your attention to. If you act thus illegally to-
wards me to-day, you may to-morrow seize upon an
<i>attaché</i> of some other paper, and prescribe him, up-
on what Judge Noah calls an inference, as you have
endeavored to proscribe me. I desire that your ho-
nors should look at this matter calmly and dispas-
sionately. You have no right to infer or assume
who is and who is not the author of any article that
may appear in any paper, without legal evidence.
If a newspaper publishes what is punishable at
law, the proprietors of the papers in this city
are abundantly responsible for what they publish;
at least, such is the case with the establishment
to which I have the honor to belong. And I
wish your honors also to be disabused on this
point. I am not a reporter of this court; I have
no desire to be one. And if your honors were
to rescind or to expunge that order in relation to
myself—I say, if, by possibility you were to do it,
though I don't believe you will—I would not sit at
<m9>———
   * We understood him to say, “Do not allow that they
have the right to sit here!” But Judge Lynch has lost
his front teeth and lisps and mumbles so, that it is very
difficult to report him accurately in this noisy Court.</m9>
<d>[Col.4]</d>
that little dirty table again, (pointing to the little
two-feet six) were I to live to be the age of <u title="Methuselah">Methu-
saleh</u>. (Here Noah forgot the Judge, and put on
the Major, and smiled heartily.) Years ago, by be-
ing presumed to possess the requisite amount of tact
and talent, and by a proper and industrious exercise
of the faculties which God has given me, I was
raised far—far above the level of this court, to which
I think I can never descend again by any adverse
train of circumstances. I was raised to a seat in
one of those chairs from which his honor Judge
Noah has so recently descended to occupy a seat
upon this bench.—(Smiles and laughter.)—I mean
the editorial chair! I am satisfied with my situa-
tion, I do my duty industriously, I serve my employ-
er assiduously; and whilst I am satisfied in my own
mind that I have paid proper attention to <i>his</i> orders,
the unjust and informal orders of this or any other
court
	——“Pass by me as the idle wind
	Which I respect not.”
   This ended the proceedings for that night, as nei-
ther member of the court replied.

   T<small>HE</small> C<small>OURT OF</small> S<small>ESSIONS, ALIAS THE</small> H<small>ENROOST</small>
C<small>OURT</small>.—We have heard a great deal of folly lately
about the bringing of the administration of this Court
into contempt. Is it the Court or the members of
the Court (the Recorder and Aldermen excepted)
which bring the Court into contempt? Look at the
conduct of Lynch and Noah; see the mode adopted
by one of admitting rascals to bail and of senten-
cing criminals. One admits that terrible villain
Butcher Joe to bail, after the police magistrates had
refused to do so; Joe gets out, runs away, and it
costs $300 to catch him. And so with others.
   In sentencing, look at the inequality—take any day;
one steals a large amount of goods—he is imprisoned
for two months; one steals a less amount; he is im-
prisoned for six months or a year. One steals a lot
of pork, he is let off; one steals some old clo', and
he is sent up for the full term. One beats and nearly
kills his father; he is suffered to go free; another
takes some food to sustain life, or clothing to cover
her nakedness, (as in the cases before Noah on Tues-
day) and she or he is sent to the Penitentiary for
several months.
   And so it is with the administration of justice ge-
nerally. A highly respectable bank robber and ras-
cal, like Levis, may plunder the people with impu-
nity. A poor wretch, who steals food to save himself
from starving, is sure to be sent to prison for the full
term. It is high time that our Sessions Court was
reformed. The Recorder appears to have left the
bench in disgust; and with such miserable creatures
as Noah and Lynch, it is nonsense to talk about law
or dignity, or even common sense. One never knew
any thing about law—and the poorest practitioner
almost at the bar of that court knows more law and
better law than the other.
   The scene yesterday, with able lawyers like Whi-
ting, Graham, Brady and O'Conner, pleading before
two such thick headed numskulls as Noah and Lynch,
was enough to sicken any one for a century.

   H<small>EALTH OF THE</small> C<small>ITY</small>.—We have heard predic-
tions of a very sickly season in the city this sum-
mer, but, so far, we have never known a more
gratifying state of the public health at midsum-
mer. Last week the interments in the city amoun-
ted to only 105—a decrease of two upon the num-
ber of the previous week. Of the whole number,
30 were men, 20 women, 34 boys, 21 girls; 35 un-
der 2 years of age.
   In Philadelphia, the number of deaths amount-
ed to 117, of whom 60 were adults, and 57 were
children.

ted and sold in the streets of Philadelphia, the
chief object of the attacks of which were the
gamblers, specifying the names of the frequent-
ers, and the location of the dens in a way that
could not be mistaken. <a href="http://www.newspapers.com/newspage/40140999/">The Ledger states</a>, that
on Saturday a number of well known blacklegs
went to the place where it was printed, in Minor
street, below Sixth, and beat all hands most un-
mercifully. The conduct of the assailants is rep-
resented as perfectly furious. All armed
themselves with whatever they could pick up at
the moment. One person, whom they took to be
the editor, was beaten over the head with a brick
until he was senseless.

	Present Judge Noah and two Aldermen.
   J<small>ULY</small> 2.—A batch of loafer soaplocks, nymphs of the
pave, and other bad characters, were paraded for the
judgement of their honors. As usual their honors gave
the small thieves the precedence.
   A negro wench named Hannah R. Smith stole a shirt,
and she was sent to the Penitentiary for 20 days.
   Mary Ann Taylor, stole a cloth cloak, and was sent up
for sixty days.
   Kate Brown was accused of stealing a cloak, but ac-
quitted.
   Rosannah Williams, a small girl, stole two gold rings,
and Rosannah was sent to the House of Refuge.
   Ned Patten, a small boy, stole a dollar bill, and he was
sent to the House of Refuge.
   Mat Galery stole a pair of new boots, and was sent to
dig stone for sixty days.
   Mary Ann Dogerty stole a lot of wearing apparel, and
she was sent to the Penitentiary for 30 days.
   Mat Conlan, a small boy, was sent to the House of Re-
fuge.
   Kate Murphy stole a small chair, and she was sent to
the Island for 30 days.
   Jem Hackett and Bill Walker, the two soaplocks who
did the Green Mountain Boy out of $10 by dropping a
pocket book, were sent to dig stone for six months.
   <i>Rowdies</i>.—Bartley Friel was tried for kicking a woman,
but acquitted.
   Bill Handley, struck Ann Henson and was sent up for
sixty days.
   Peter Vance was tried for whipping John Perry, and
sent up for fifteen days.
   Three soaplocks and one nymph of the pave were dis-
charged with a recommendation to join the Teetotal So-
ciety. Two Irish servant girls, who were arrested for ta-
king moonlight walks with their lovers, were discharg-
ed with a caution not to do so again, and the Court ad-
journed <i>sine die</i>.

			<b>City Intelligence.</b>
   M<small>ORE</small> T<small>RICKS UPON</small> T<small>RAVELLERS</small>.—If there is any city or
corporate town either in the Old or New World, where
strangers are more easily victimized and robbed, more
openly than in this good and moral city of Gotham, it has
never been our good or ill fortune to sojourn therein.—
Day after day cases occur at the Police, which mani-
fest the necessity of a Day Police or Patrol, especially at
the wharves, railroad and packet stations; but none of
the authorities endeavor to get a preventative police ap-
pointed. A few days since a poor immigrant named Da-
niel Wood, arrived here from Liverpool in the ship Lau-
ra, and before he had been three hours in the city he was
pounced upon by a soaplock, supposed to be, one John
Hawkins, who proffered his services to show the stranger
some place to which he was directed to apply for infor-
mation concerning his friends n America. The soaplock
led the helpless stranger through lanes and blind alleys,
until he found himself in a wood yard, when the soaplock
robbed his victim of all the money he had about him,
knocked the poor devil down and fled. Two days after
he met the same rascal in the streets, and brought him
by force to the Police, but the probability is that he will
escape by proving an <i>alibi</i>.
   S<small>USANNAH AND THE</small> E<small>LDER</small>.—A nymph of the pave who
called herself Susannah Reed, was brought up, charged
as a disorderly person, she being caught by the watch in
a very peculiar situation with an elderly gentlemanly
man, who was not in custody. The Magistrate having
elicited from the watch the particulars of Susannah's <i>faux
pas</i>, which occurred in the Park, sent that young lady to
the Island for thirty days. Susannah said as she left the
bar, that she was another proof of the injustice of the
laws, which always punished the least guilty, and per-
mitted the male animals to escape.

		<m8>Reported for the Courier & Enquirer.</m8>
   <i>An Incident</i>.—In the Court of Special Sessions,
yesterday, a man named John Fisher, was brought
up, for some trifling offence, for trial. His wife,
a beautiful young woman not more than seventeen
years of age, appeared at the bar with an infant
in her arms, as the advocate of her husband.—
She was dressed plainly, and by no means in the
height of fashion. Her presence, her child and her
tears had a softening effect on the Court. The hus-
band was discharged and left the room. The young
wife lingered behind to sob out a few sentences of
gratitude. Judge Noah spoke to her a few kind
words, and enquired of her “are you really so des-
titute as you appear, and is that your child?” “As
there's a God<u title=",” "> </u>replied the poor creature<u title=", “">” </u>it is all true.
Since my husband has been in prison for triflingly
offending against the dignity of our Landlord the
latter, the inhuman monster, had turned me and my
child out of doors, and retained for his rent, as he
claims our all—little all. For four days I have with
my child subsisted in the open air, depending wholly
upon the cold charity of such as chanced to pass by
betimes<u title=".”">.</u>
   This was more than Judge Noah could stand with
his face concealed from the gaze of the spectators,
to conceal an evident emotion, he beckoned to the
pour woman, who, as she approached him, he slipped
into her hand a <i>five dollar note</i>, which he drew from
his pocket, and wishing her better success and hap-
piness hereafter. She left the Court with an altered
countenance. The Judge adjusted his spectacles,
called the Court to order, and the business pro-
ceeded.

   <i>Ezra White</i>.—This distinguished individual, who
has recently taken up his residence at Sing Sing, has
proved himself a most expert workman, in the line of
carpet weaving. Capt. Smith of the Police, on Thurs-
day brought down a specimen in the form of a hearth
rug of the most exquisite workmanship and finish.—
The article may be seen by the curious in such mat-
ters, at the store of Lemuel Philips, 235 Pearl street.

   <i>Sing Sing Statistics</i>.—Officer A. M. C. Smith,
who yesterday returned from the State Prison at Sing
Sing, reports that during the month of June ultimo,
six persons were discharged, their time having ex-
pired. There were remaining in Prison, men 766,
women 68—total, 834.

   <i>Inquest</i>.—The Coroner, yesterday, held an inquest
at the City Hospital, on the body of John Campbell,
a laborer, born in Ireland, aged 40 years. Deceased
was on Thursday employed upon a church in pro-
gress of erection, corner of Broome and Elizabeth
sts. He became very much heated and drank freely
of cold water, after which he was taken suddenly ill,
with fits and spasms. He was taken to the Hospi-
tal, where he shortly after expired—Verdict, death
from congestion of the brain, caused by drinking
cold water.

			<b>General Sessions.</b>
<m9>Present the Recorder, Judges Lynch and Noah, and two
			Aldermen.
   The following gentlemen were sworn of the grand
jury:
   Philip Henry, foreman, Calvin Candit, Saml. F. Mott,
Charles Sandford, Joseph Whitfield, Bernard Graham,
Hamilton Murray, Anthony V. Winans, James Paton,
Henry Champrey, Francis Clark, Joseph F. Atwill, John
Milpar, Richard P. Lawrence, Wm. L. Rushton, Saml. S.
Rockwell, James Leary, and Ben. Richards.
   The jurors having been sworn, Judge Lynch procee-
ded to charge the grand inquest on the five statutory pro-
visions which it is incumbent on this court to bring
monthly to the notice of the grand inquest, to wit:—The
gross impropriety of taking more than seven per cent for
the usance of money—the palpable immorality of lotte-
ries—the necessity of preserving the election laws in-
violate—the folly of erecting wooden buildings this side
of the fire limits—and lastly, the necessity of the grand
inquest keeping their own secrets.
   His honor having delivered himself on these fruitful
topics, then proceeded to inform the grand jurors that a
certain newspaper was daily published in this city, cal-
led the Morning Herald. That some reporter employed
on said wicked newspaper, had brought this court into
contempt by misreporting a certain trial of one Thomas
Ritchie. That this court had then, in the exercise of its
sound discretion, proceeded to expel some one reporter of
said Morning Herald from a seat at the reporters' table.
The Court might have acted summarily in the matter, and
committed the author of said report to close custody; but
did not proceed to that extremity. After this, a series of
articles had been levelled at this Court, which had been
noticed in a letter written by the petit jury, which letter
would have been lain before the last grand jury if there
had been sufficient time. The Court would now remark
that in calling the attention of the grand jury to this sub-
ject, that if a true bill should be found against the editor
of the Herald, it would be sent for trial to the Court of
Oyer and Terminer, which tribunal had concurrent ju-
risdictions in such matters.
   And this court could not help remarking that the pro-
ceedings of courts of justice must not be ridiculed by the
press, and that if such ridicule was perpetrated it was the
bounden duty of the grand jury to sustain the dignity of
the courts, and to see that their deliberations were treat-
ed with that forbearance and respect to which they were
entitled.
   Judge Lynch, having made this special charge, left
the Bench to the care of the Recorder, Judge Noah and
Alderman <u>Baylis</u>.
   D<small>ISORDERLY</small> H<small>OUSES</small>.—Mary Layton, an ill-looking
specimen of the softer part of our species, was put to the
bar, charged with keeping a disorderly house in Water
street. Benj. F. Parker, officer of the 4th Ward, proved
that the prisoner kept a house of ill-fame in that Ward. It
was a noisy concern, frequented by sailors and women,
who committed every crime except murder, and even that
crime might have been perpetrated, for the Coroner had
been called to the house.
   District Attorney—Is she married?
   Witness—Well, I know Layton, and I know another
man who has lived with her.
   Prisoner—Come, Mr. Parker, don't you be too hard,
for you know I was respectable a year ago, at Brooklyn.
   Witness—Oh! I don't know as how I can be too hard,
Mary.
   The prisoner made no defence on the merits, and the
jury found her guilty.
   William Langdon was next put to the bar for a similar
offence, and acquitted through a flaw in the indictment.
   Their Honors then adjourned.</m9>

<b>Amusing Business in the Sessions—A New
			<u>Bull</u> against the Herald.</b>
   The unconstitutional portion of the Court of Ses-
sions (that portion not recognised by the Corporation)
composed of two worn-out politicians, Messrs. Noah
and Lynch, presented a curious scene yesterday.
   It appears by our report in another column, that
Judge Lynch charged the Grand Jury to bring in a
bill of indictment against the Herald, because it had
brought his side of the Court into contempt—and
also, because our reports of their petit larceny pro-
ceedings are incorrect and erroneous.
   If the Grand Jury examine the matter closely, we
imagine they will find that Judges Noah and Lynch
have brought themselves into contempt, if such be
the fact in the case as they <u title="=allege">alledge</u>. They made them-
selves ridiculous by issuing a pompous bulletin against
a reporter, for some mistake they alleged he made
in a report of the trial of a common thief, and now
they have followed this Pompolino business up, by
charging the Grand Jury to indict the Herald for
publishing these mistakes and errors.
	...
   The Corporation of this city denies the legality of
the appointment of Noah and Lynch—and will not
pay their salaries, except on compulsion. In this
opinion they were sustained by a large majority of the
people at the last election. Is this indictable? And
will the grand jury indict 23,000 voters? We have
no doubt, but, at the next session of the legislature,
that body will abolish the offices of Noah and Lynch
outright. Is this opinion also indictable?
	...
He is totally unfit for the seat he fills. Judge Lynch
is a little more of a lawyer, but he wants the temper
and attainments to place his portion of the Court of
Sessions as high in reputation as Judge Mansfield
once did his Court. On many occasions he admits
persons to bail, on writs of <i>habeas corpus</i>, that he
ought not to have done either in equity or in law.
Such is our belief—is that a crime? We go no fur-
ther than the recent case of the person accused of
burning the National Theatre, which we believe is
not a bailable offence in law, and yet was bailed for
$1,000 by Judge Lynch, so that any other theatre
that is ready to be burned down, can now have a
chance to effect such a piece of business.
	...
We yield to none in a reverence for an enlightened,
learned, and courteous administration of justice, in
every court and on every bench; but we should be
sorry to think for one moment, that the reputation of
our ordinary courts of law, or the dignity and learn-
ing of our criminal bench, were entirely dependent
on the learning and fitness of M. M. Noah and his
coadjutor. If we are to be indicted and punished
for this opinion, come on at once. We should give
up our life at the stake sooner than believe that the
elevation and dignity of the criminal bench of New
York depended on the learning and sense of the
same individual who attempted, from Grand Island,
a few years ago, to palm a gross imposture on the
Hebrew people—the same individual too, who, du-
ring an editorial life of twenty-five years, did more
than any other man of his age, to bring religion, mo-
rals, politics and society into contempt, by every
species of low wit and ribaldry—the same individual
too, who, no later than last year, while he was editor
of the “Evening Star,” made a series of ferocious
attacks on ex-Recorder Morris, and endeavored to
bring into contempt a man and a judge that is truly
an ornament of society, and of the legal institutions
of the land. If the grand jury find any bill, it ought
to be a bill against this very personage, against whom
there is a sentence still hanging over his head in his
own Court, for breaking open the seal of another
man's letter.
   But we understand all this movement—it is the
last and cheapest edition—a sort of an Extra, price
one penny, of the “moral war,” and it will end as
that did, in the total overthrow of its projectors.—
We shall now go, tooth and nail, for the repeal of
the unconstitutional law, under which these two
judges sit on the bench, and shall never give it up,
until the venerated form of the ancient Court of Ses-
sions be restored to New York.

	GENERAL SESSIONS—Yesterday.
   The following gentlemen were duly <u title="empanelled">enpanel-
led</u> and sworn as a Grand Jury for the term:
     Philip Henry, foreman, Calvin Candit, Samuel F.
Mott, Charles Sandford, Joseph Whitfield, Bernard
Graham, Hamilton Murray, Anthony V. Winans,
James Paton, Henry Champrey, Francis Clark,
Joseph F. Atwill, John Milpar, Richard P. Lawrence,
Wm. L. Rushton, Samuel S. Rockwell, James Leary,
Benj. Richards.
   In the course of the charge to the Grand Jurors,
Judge Lynch (who delivered the charge) called the
attention of the panel to the “Herald” newspaper, in
the following terms.
   “During the last June term, one James Ritchie
was tried and convicted on one indictment for grand
larceny, and on another for receiving stolen goods,
knowing them to have been stolen. In professing to
give a report of the proceedings in one of these tri-
als, a newspaper printed in the city of New York,
called the <i>New York Herald</i>, contained various false
statements, for which this Court unanimously made
an order dismissing from the table, appropriated for
the use of the Reporters, the person who reported for
that paper.
   “In other numbers of the same paper, further false
reports of the proceedings and decisions of this court
appeared, to which were added reflections personally
upon the members of the Court.”
   [Judge Lynch then proceeded to state that he thus
called the attention of the Grand Jurors, at the es-
pecial instance and request of the petit Jurors who
had served during the June term, and who had felt
themselves aggrieved and insulted by the false and
ridiculous reports of the Herald.] He then proceed-
ed as follows.
   “In this country, it has seldom been found neces-
sary for Courts to protect themselves against such
publications by punishing the guilty parties for a con-
tempt. It has generally happened that a portion of
the press which is properly conducted, has furnished
a corrective, sufficient for all useful purposes,
against the licentiousness of any other portion of it,
by exposing the offender at the bar of public opinion.
But when an Editor has placed himself or is placed
by circumstances, in such a situation that the press
at large will not notice his effusions, and particular-
ly in cases palpably false, where statements of the
proceedings and decisions of this court are published,
by which a portion of the public might be misled,
the Court do not feel themselves at liberty any long-
er to omit to notice such libellous publications, low
and vulgar though they be.
   Taking into consideration the complaint made by
so respectable a portion of our citizens as the mem-
bers of the petit Jury, I have referred to, and also that,
if the accused should be convicted on an indictment,
the law provides a greater latitude of punishment, and
therefore that the measure of it might be better adapt-
ed to the degree of the offence, the Court instead of
adopting summary proceedings as for a criminal con-
tempt, have thought proper to call your attention to
the subject, and have directed the District Attorney
to lay the papers before you, in full confidence that
you will give it the consideration to which it is enti-
tled. If a bill should be found it will best comport
with the wishes of this Court, that it should be sent
to the Court of Oyer and Terminer, for trial, which
has concurrent jurisdiction.
   In every well ordered community, Courts and Ju-
ries should be protected in the fearless and conscien-
tious discharge of their duties; if those who are
charged with the administration of the laws, may be
assailed with impunity, with the shafts of malice or
ridicule, good order and decorum will be violated and
the ends of justice may be defeated<u title=".”">.</u>
   Mary Layton was tried and convicted of keeping a
disorderly house.
   William Langdon was tried on a similar charge and
acquitted, and there being no other cases ready for
trial, the court adjourned.

   ☞ <b>An agreeable and healthy Recreation in the
Afternoon.</b>—No pleasanter or more attractive jaunt can be made at
this season of the year, than by taking a trip to Hoboken and a walk
along the shady and picturesque banks on the margin of the river.
As an additional inducement this summer it is generally admitted that
the walks and grounds of this charming spot are now more beautiful
than ever. Access is rendered easy from different parts of the city by
the Barclay, Canal, and Christopher street Ferries, the Boats on which
have been newly and comfortably refitted. In the evening the Canal-
street Ferry Boat runs until ten o'clock from Hoboken.   jy10 6wis*

   J<small>UDGE</small> L<small>YNCH</small>—A<small>NOTHER</small> C<small>ONTEMPT</small>.—On refer-
ence to the report of the proceedings in the “Board
of Supervisors” yesterday, it will be seen that that
body refused, by a vote of 11 to 8, to pay Judge
Lynch any salary for his services in the Sessions.—
This refusal is made on the ground that his appoint-
ment was unconstitutional, and that he has earned
no salary. Judge Noah has not yet presented his
claim, but when it is, he will meet with the same re-
fusal.
   If the Grand Jury be now deliberating on the
subject of “contempts of courts,” here is a case for
them. How can a judge be treated more contempt-
uously than to be refused his salary—to be told,
“Sir, your services are useless—your appointment
is illegal, and you yourself not wanted—make your-
self scarce.” This would seem to be the acme of
contempt—and if the charge of Judge Lynch be
followed, the Grand Jury ought to indict the “Board
of Supervisors” at once, for committing a most hein-
ous contempt.

<d>[Col.4]</d>
			<b>Board of Supervisors.</b>
<m9>   Yesterday at 12 o'clock this body convened. Present
his honor the Mayor, his honor the Recorder, and seven-
teen Aldermen. His honor the Mayor took the chair,
and directed the minutes of the last meeting to be read.
   There being no objection to the minutes, they were
confirmed.
   His honor the Mayor said he had a communication
from John C. Spencer, in relation to the persons to be
elected to the Asylum for the Blind—Referred.
   An application from A. M. C. Smith, for the payment of
$249 38, being expenses incurred in relation to the trial
of James B. Glentworth. Several members objected to
the charge as <u title="exorbitant">exhorbitant</u>, and the application was re-
fused.
   His honor the Mayor said he had a claim from the
three judges of the Common Pleas, for serving on the
bench of the Court of Sessions from the time Judge Sand-
ford resigned until Judge Noah was appointed. These
claims were as follows:<table style="white-space:normal;font-size:90%;margin-left:3em">
<tr><td style="width:15em">Judge Ulshoeffer,</td> <td align=right>$176</td></tr>
<tr><td>Judge <u>Ingliss</u>,</td> <td align=right>244</td></tr>
<tr><td>Judge Ingraham,</td> <td align=right>108</td></tr>
<tr><td> </td> <td align=right>——<br>$528</td></tr></table>
   This claim was referred to Aldermen Leonard, Purdy,
and Kimball.
   An application was made from Edward Sandford, ex-
judge of the Sessions, for the payment of $719, being the
amount of his salary due, together with the costs incur-
red in the prosecution of a suit against the Corporation.
   This claim was referred to Aldermen Leonard, Purdy,
and Kimball.
   An application was made from Charles Taylor, for the
payment of $80, being his charge for ten days board for
four police officers, during the Aqueduct riots, at <i>two dol-
lars per diem for each police officer</i>. A member asked if the
$2 per diem included every charge, as he believed it was
more than was charged at the first hotels in the city.
   Another member said this was one of the most out-
rageous charges he had ever met with; police officers,
employed at $5 per day, to send in a bill of $80 for their
ten days' feed at a tavern!
   The application was then <u title="referred">refered</u> to a committee.
   His honor the Mayor then introduced the following
preamble and resolution:—
   Whereas, the law establishing the offices of associate
judges of the Court of General Sessions of the Peace, in
and for the city and county of New York, and giving to
each said Judge the annual salary of $2000, was passed
without being applied for by the city authorities, and is
against the wishes of the inhabitants; and whereas, also,
the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of James
Lynch vs. the Aldermen and Commonalty of the city of
New York, indicates that the law, so far at least as the ap-
pointment of said judges and the payment of said sala-
ries, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=iXZZAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA257" title="Chap.311, §5: ...associate judges...shall receive each a yearly salary of two thousand dollars, to be paid...out of the city treasury in quarterly payments...">is obligatory upon the city of New York</a>, and the sala-
ry may be by suit recovered against the city of New
York, with costs; and whereas, also, it is the duty of the
Board of Supervisors to obey the law, when constitution-
ally made, and prevents costs being made to the city, so
long as said law exists.
   Now therefore,
   Resolved, That we do not approve of nor sanction said
law, and hope for its repeal.
   Resolved, That the comptroller of the city be and
hereby is directed to pay the salaries of said Associate
Judges of the Court of Sessions, in accordance with the
act entitled “<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=CZ1DAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA265" title="Chap.276, §4: The arrears of salary of the associate judges...shall be deemed county charges...and the mayor...shall audit and allow the account for such arrears...">An act to enable the Supervisors of the City
and County of New York to raise money by tax</a>” passed
May 26, 1841.
   Alderman Purdy said, he agreed partly with the
preamble, and he denied part. For instance, he denied
that the Supreme Court had passed on this matter at all.
   The Mayor said the preamble only said the Court had
indicated such an opinion.
   Alderman Purdy thought the Judge should be left to
his remedy at common law, for if the City Authorities
held themselves to be governed by constitutions or char-
ters, then they were not bound to pay the Judge. Here
the worthy Alderman cited the city charter, and con-
tended that, under that instrument no money could be
drawn from the City Treasury, unless previously ap-
propriated by the Common Council. He also contended,
that no such money could be legally paid, even if all
the judicial tribunals, and all the lawyers in the world
were to say the contrary.
   A number of amendments to the original preamble
were then read, discussed, and passed, which resulted
in the following amendments, which were adopted by
eleven ayes and eight nays.
   First. It was moved and carried, to strike out all that
part of the preamble after the word “authorities” in the
fifth line down to the word “costs.”
   Secondly. To insert the words people of the city and
county of New York, or the representatives in the State
Legislature from this city.
   So that the preamble when amended, would read,
   Whereas, the law establishing the offices of associate
judges of the Court of General Sessions of the Peace, in
and for the city and county of New York, and giving to
each said Judge the annual salary of $2000, was passed
without being applied for by the city authorities, the
people of the city and county of New York, or the re-
presentatives in the State Legislature from this city; and
whereas, also, it is the duty of the Board of Supervisors
to obey the law, when constitutionally made, and pre-
vents costs being made to the city, so long as said law
exists.
   Alderman Benson moved to strike out the whole of the
preamble, which was lost.
   Alderman Purdy moved, that as amended it be adopted.
Carried, 11 ayes to 8 nays.
   Alderman Lee moved to strike out the two resolutions,
and to insert as an amendment the following:—
   Resolved, That inasmuch as the law creating the two
Associate Judges of the Court of Sessions, passed 1840,
was in violation of the rights of the city of New York,
guaranteed to it by the State Constitution and City
charter, therefore the Board of Supervisors decline pay-
ing the salaries of the Judges appointed under that law.
   This resolution was lost by eleven nays to eight ayes.
   The question was then taken on the adoption of the
two resolutions appended to the preamble of his Honor
the Mayor, when it appeared that both were negatived
by a majority of <i>three</i>.
   Alderman Purdy moved that the whole proceedings on
this subject, reports, votes, &c. &c. be published, which
motion was carried <i>nem con</i>.
   And the Board adjourned.</m9>

	<b>Governor Seward and his Policy.</b>
   The short-sighted and narrow-minded policy of
Governor Seward is now beginning to <u title="develop">develope</u> their
injurious effects in this city, in the broadest and bold-
est characters.
   His illegal and unconstitutional interference with
the Court of Sessions—his arbitrary removal of Re-
corder Morris and Judge Scott—his appointment of
Noah and Lynch to offices for which they are unfit,
both in temper and attainments—his other appoint-
ments to office, of men notoriously unfit in every
point of character—his attempt to destroy the integ-
rity and efficiency of the Fire Department—but,
above and beyond all, his effort to subvert the pre-
sent Public School System, and to set all the differ-
ent sects of Christianity at variance with each other,
are some of the evils of his administration of the
State government.
   On the last subject, an event has taken place that
would signalize the middle ages better than the pre-
sent day, in the midst of an enlightened community.
   A Protestant clergyman, discussing a public ques-
tion, in one of his own churches, has been assailed
with hisses, and forced to leave the pulpit, in conse-
quence of a crowd of persons, principally of Catho-
lics, differing in opinion with him, and thus resent-
ing his attacks on their creed and their sect. The
spirit of religious agitation and religious persecution
has been revived in our day, in almost as violent a
manner as in that of Luther or Calvin.
   This unfortunate state of things has been entirely
produced by the folly and weakness of Governor
Seward, in attempting to legislate for the gratifica-
tion of a sect instead of a whole people. He has
thrown into the public arena the hand grenade of
religious agitation, and who can now tell when it is
to cease?
   On this, and on several other accounts, we are
afraid that the period of Mr. Seward's term in office
will only be remembered for its folly, its rashness,
its unthinking attempt to meddle with sound princi-
ples and established institutions, merely to subserve
the fleeting popularity of a sect, a clique, or a day.

   D<small>ECENCY</small>.—J<small>UDGE</small> N<small>OAH</small> is blowing up Alderman
Purdy in the “Evening Star,” and calling the ma-
jority of the Common Council “nullifiers,” and other
<u title="opprobrious">approbrious</u> names, because they do not recognise
him and Lynch as judges, and <u>wont</u> pay them sala-
ries. Noah also made the disgraceful attack on John
Van Buren's marriage, in the same paper; and yet
this is the man that asks the grand jury to indict the
“Herald,” for saying that he is not fit to be a judge.
Out upon such a hypocrite. <i>Apropos.</i>—We learn
that Noah has made up our punishment already. I
am to be fined $1,000, including all my old clo', and
my reporter is to be imprisoned. Fat chickens, but
not yet hatched.

quarts, is a very elegant specimen of the arts, and is from

fitted the lock of the store.
   For the defence Alfred Crommelin deposed that he

has always found him to be perfectly honest. Mr.
Shaler as counsel for the accused, contended that
there was no proof that the accused opened the door

   G<small>OVERNOR</small> S<small>EWARD, AND THE</small> A<small>NTI</small>-M<small>ASONIC</small> F<small>AC-
TION</small>.—The detestable, religious agitation encou-
raged and fomented by Governor Seward, is begin-
ning to open all eyes to his course of policy, to his
advisers—and to their origin and character in for-
mer days.
  The Seward <i>clique</i> is only the old anti-masonic
faction, whose hypocrisy, tyranny, folly and reck-
lessness, formerly marred the prosperity of western
New York for many years. The same spirit has
characterised the state government since their ac-
cession to power in Albany.
   Seward and his <i>clique</i> first passed the Free Bank
Law, which destroyed the currency of the State,
blew up twenty-three banks, and saddled the peo-
ple with millions of dollars in losses—in broken bills,
and fraudulent post notes. Secondly—they have
increased the State debt nearly $30,000,000 in three
years, without any increased advantage. Thirdly,
they have wasted the credit of the state upon spe-
culative railroads, and denied it to those that were
useful. Fourthly, they have appointed persons to
lucrative offices, for violating the laws, and pipe-
laying at the polls. Fifthly, they have impaired the
respectability of the Court of Sessions, and violated
the charter, by appointing two incompetent men,
Noah and Lynch, to act as judges. Sixthly, they
have attempted to destroy, by making it political,
the Fire Department of New York. Seventhly,
they have opened the floodgates of religious excite-
ment, and sought to break down the Public School
system, in order to gratify a single sect, at the ex-
pense of all the rest. And eighthly, they are now
seeking to enact an alien and <u title="seditious">sedition</u> law against
the liberty of the press, through the operation of a
pair of incompetent and unconstitutional judges of
the Sessions, who have the audacity to charge jurors
to bring in bills for contempt.
   If ever a great city and a mighty state have been
disgraced by a faction, it has been the city and
state of New York, by the wicked and unprincipled
measures and appointments, proceeding from Go-
vernor Seward and the anti-masonic faction that
rules at Albany.

	<b>Meeting of the Board of Supervisors.</b>
   A meeting of this body took place yesterday, and
as a long and violent discussion was expected, rela-
tive to the payment of the salary of Mr. Lynch, cal-
led by some Judge Lynch, there was a full attend-
ance.
	...
   Here some one presented a bill from John Davis,
<i>for cleaning, sweetening and purifying the Court of
Sessions. Price</i> $23.
   This bill raised a pretty general laugh; and some
one said, “Well then, it appears, after all, that the
remarks of the “Herald” were right; that the ses-
sions was a dirty and disagreeable court, if it cost
$23 to clean it!”
   Ald. Lee—For cleaning what sir? (Laughter.)
   Mayor—The Court of Sessions!
   Voice—That wanted cleansing.
   Alderman—Who certifies to it, sir.
   Mayor—Recorder Tallmadge. (Laughter.) What's
the pleasure of the board.
   Alderman—Move paid. Carried.
   Mayor—Here's a bill of the Coroner.
   Aldermen—For how much.
   Mayor—$1,236 12¼, and here's $5 added.
	...
   Finally, it was referred to a committee, with pow-
er to pay. Aldermen of the 10th, 14th and 15th
were the committee.
   Ald. Purdy.—I have here a bill from Ex-Sheriff
Acker for $1,196.
	...
   Benson.—Move—referred—same committee.
   Mayor.—With power?
   Benson.—No, sir, (rather roughly, but good hu-
moredly.)
   Purdy.—I should have no objection; but part of
it is due to the newspapers for advertising, and the
printers want their money, and I want them paid.
   Mayor.—We shall meet again to-morrow.
   The bill was referred, and then re-considered.
   Ald. Purdy.—The printers want their money, and
I want to see them paid; therefore I want the bill
acted upon.
   Ald. Lee.—So do other people want their money,
I suppose.
   Ald. Leonard.—There's none due any one else;
all the rest goes to the Sheriff, for charges. And I
understand he's in arrears to the Corporation some
$3,000 or $4,000; and it's time he paid that, before
we vote him any more money. (Laughter.)
	...
   Here Ald. Bradhurst made his appearance; and
presented a bill for carriage hire, for taking Justice
Murphy and men out to the Harlem war. It was
referred.
   Here the Lynchites were afraid the defenders of
the city charter and state constitution would outvote
them on the subject of <i>Mister</i> Lynch's (commonly
called Judge Lynch) salary, and they moved a re-
cess till to-day, at 12 o'clock; which was carried.
After which, the meeting adjourned, and then there
was a great deal of chaffing among the members of
the Board.

   <i>Trial of Madame Restell</i>.—The District Attorney called on
the trial of Caroline Lohman, alias Ann Lohman, alias Madame
Restell, indicted for a misdemeanor in producing a premature
and unnatural birth of Mrs. Ann Maria Purdy, wife of William
W. Purdy, late of the corner of Broome-street and the Bowery,
on the 20th July, 1839; and after the formality of swearing triers,
challenging jurors, &c., in order to obtain impartial men to try
the issue, a jury was at length obtained to try the case. Mr.
La Forge, associate Counsel, opened the case on the part of the
prosecution, and stated that the indictment contained two counts,
one for administering medicines on the 2d June to produce the
effect sought, and the other for producing the premature birth,
on the 20th July, 1839.
   William W. Purdy deposed that he was the husband of Ann
Maria Purdy, and was married the 26th November, 1837; that
she is now dead, having died at Newark, N. J., on the 28th of
April last. Saw her affix her name to certain depositions taken
before Justice Merritt on the 22d March last, and also to another
affidavit sworn to on the 5th April last. He lived with his wife
up to the time of her death, and was never absent from her a
single night, except when she went to Philadelphia last sum-
mer, by the advice of a physician, for the benefit of her health.
She had a gold watch and some gold rings when witness mar-
ried her. She was a clerk in a confectionery store in Pearl-st.
Had one living child by her. She was never well after the
miscarriage with the second, in July, <u title="1839">1830</u>.
   Henry W. Merritt, Police Justice, deposed that the two de-
positions of Mrs. Purdy, dated the 22d March, 1841, were taken
and subscribed before him at the residence of Mrs. Purdy, cor-
ner of Broome st. and the Bowery, in the presence of the accu-
sed, who was informed of her right to have counsel and to cross
examine Mrs. Purdy, who was sick and confined to her bed.—
The accused said her counsel, (Mr. <u>Morrell</u>) would come; but
he did not, and she asked Mrs. P. several questions (substan-
tially only one) which were not taken down, as the same ques-
tion had been asked Mrs. Purdy before in her direct examina-
tion. The object in taking the accused to Mrs. Purdy's resi-
dence was that the latter might identify the accused.
   [The District Attorney then proposed to read the affidavits of
Mrs. Purdy, taken before Justice Merritt on the 22d March last,
to which Messrs. Jordan and <u>Morrell</u>, the counsel for the accu-
sed objected, and the argument as to the admission of the affi-
davits as evidence, is to come <u>on on</u> Thursday (this day) at 11
o'clock. On the admission of these the whole case rests. The
Court then adjourned.]

			<b>General Sessions.</b>
Present—the Recorder, Judge Noah, and two Aldermen.
   J<small>ULY</small> 14.—Ezekiel Petty, indicted for a misdemeanor in
selling lottery policies, pleaded guilty to the charge. Sa-
rah Purnell also pleaded guilty to a similar charge.
   <i>Madame Restell's Case</i>.—Caroline Ann Lohman, alias
Madame Restell, came into Court and was arraigned in
due form. The fair accused was attired in the most ele-
gant manner, in a black satin walking dress, white satin
bonnet, of the cottage pattern, and a very elegant white
veil of Brussels lace. In her hand she carried a parcel
of printed papers, which made some persons mistake her
for the lady Presidentess of the Tract Society.
   Messrs. <u>Jordon</u> and Morrill, counsel for the accused
said that as this case had made some noise in the world,
it was their intention to examine the Jury pretty strictly,
and they wished to have <u title="triers">tryers</u> sworn as to the compe-
tency of the jurors.
   The Court appointed and swore Charles O'Conner and
Mr. E. J. Porter as <u title="triers">tryers</u>.
   William K. Asher was then called, and examined
touching his competency to serve as a juror.
   Asher said he had read a good deal against the accus-
ed, and nothing in her favor; but he was not prejudiced
either pro. or con.—so he was admitted.
   Horace Hays was next called and admitted, as also Je-
remiah R. Field.
   James E. Rogers said he had formed an opinion, and
was rejected.
   William Brown had formed an opinion, so he was let
off.
   George Andrew had no prejudice, and was sworn.
   Moses B. Depau said he had not heard much about the
lady, and hardly knew there was such a person. He
was sworn.
   William A. Tyler had formed an opinion, and was re-
jected.
   Elijah Haller had no opinion about it, so he was sworn.
   Bernard Sheridan said the matter had been much talk-
ed over in his family, but he had so little recollection
about it, that he had no opinion at all—so he was sworn.
   William T. Hemmingway had no prejudice, and was
admitted.
   Elisha P. Delaplaine said he had read a good deal of
stuff about it, which had influenced his mind. So he
was let off.
   James Cowles said he was quite indifferent—and he
was sworn.
   Lathrop L. Sturgiss confessed to a prejudice, and was
excused.
   Ezekiel Weed had no prejudice, so he was sworn.
   John C. Dowling had made up his mind, and was
let off.
   Israel Isaacs had not a thought unfavorable to Madame
Restell—so he was taken.
   Richard Elsey, had made up his mind—so he was ex-
cused.
   William K. Shaw had formed his opinion, and was also
excused.
   John Conway said he was prejudiced, and was excused.
   John Duncan had got an opinion ready made. He was
let off.
   Charles Crane had read newspaper reports somewhat
unfavorable to Madame Restell, but they did not make
much impression on his mind. He was admitted to serve
on the jury.
   As he was the twelfth man, the jury was held to be
complete, and all sworn.
   The indictment was then read to the jury. It contains
two counts, charging the accused with a misdemeanor,
in attempting to produce an abortion on the person of
Anna Maria Purdy, on the 2d of June and 22d of July 1840.
   William W. Purdy examined by the District Attorney.
—I was the husband of Anna Maria Purdy. She died at
Newark the 28th of April last. I was present at the ex-
amination taken by Justice Merritt.
   District Attorney—Did you see your wife sign this de-
position?
   Jordan—He saw her sign the paper shown him,
perhaps.
   District Attorney—Well, what does it matter? He saw
her sign the paper. Now will the officers send for Jus-
tice Merritt?
   Jordan—Mr. Purdy, I'll take the liberty of asking you
a few questions: did you and your wife live together in
1839.
   Witness—Why, we never lived or slept apart, sir.
   Jordan—What, did you live together before you were
married?
   Witness—No Sir.
   Jordan—When were you married<u>.</u>
   Witness—The 26th November, 1837.
   Jordan—Where did you live in June, 1839<u>.</u>
   Witness—Either in May or June we broke up house-
keeping and went to board in Mott street. Before that
we lived at 200 Elm street.
   Jordan—What business were you in?
   Witness—I was in the smoking line.
   Jordan—What did you smoke?
   Witness—Meat, and fish sometimes.
   Jordan—Were you at home pretty constantly?
   Witness—I was at home pretty much in the day, and
always of a night. I used to go to fires though, some-
times.
   Jordan—Did you know, in May or June 1839, there was
such a woman as Madame Restell?
   Witness—No sir.
   Jordan—Was your wife in the habit of being absent
from home?
   Witness—Oh! she was in the habit of going round for
shopping if she wanted any thing. She was not in the
habit of running about, if that's what you mean. She
went once to the dress maker's, and once to the Bowery
to buy a dress. If she wanted to go out she went out like
other women.
   Jordan—Do you know if she ever went out at all?
   Witness—Well, I know she went to 200 Bowery.
   Jordan—<i>How</i> do you know?
   Witness—Because I went after her, and paid for the
dress she bought.
   Jordan—Do you know she did not go somewhere else,
now?
   Witness—Why, sir, she went and came back, and I
went to the Bowery, and I guess that's enough, for my
sister said—
   Jordan—Stop, sir, or I shall ask the Court to order you
into custody. For, your honor, I intend to treat this wit-
ness fairly, but at the same time I stand here, knowing
what I'm about, and if the gentlemen on the other side—
   Recorder—Now, Mr. Purdy, listen to the counsel, and
respond to his question, and nothing more.
   Here the District Attorney got up and charged Jordan
with abusing the witness, and Jordan replied, that if the
witness would let his tongue run with the rapidity of a
mill tail, it was the duty of counsel to stop him. He felt
as good natured as the District Attorney, and wanted to
go on.
   Recorder—There, go on, gentlemen; attend to the
question, Mr. Purdy.
   Jordan—Now, Mr. Purdy, you did not go with your
wife to the Bowery, I suppose, after all?
   Witness—No, sir.
   Jordan—Did you go out with her at any other time?
   Witness—Yes, sometimes.
   Jordan—Did she ever go out without you?
   Witness—Yes, sometimes.
   Jordan—Had she company when she went out?
   Witness—Well, I believe she went alone.
   Jordan—Did she ever go out with company to your
knowledge?
   Witness—Once she did, when I could not go; she went
with a young man of my acquaintance, of the name of
Mowbray.
   Jordan—What was he?
   Witness—A painter.
   Jordan—Oh! then we have it at last. Young painter
Mowbray went out with her!
   Witness—Yes, they went for a walk on a fourth of
July night, and came back again in a short time.
   Jordan—Did any body else go with them on that night?
   Witness—Yes, I think Mowbray took his lady; her
whom he since married.
   Jordan—Did you, sir, see the lady and Mowbray with
your wife at all<u>.</u>
   Witness—No, sir, but I saw Mowbray, and the servant
girl said—
   Recorder—Never mind the girl now.
   Jordan—Where is this Mr. Mowbray now, sir<u>.</u>
   Witness—I don't know.
   Jordan—How long is it since you saw him?
   Witness—One day last week, I think.
   Jordan—Have you ever been in the employ of the Har-
lem Railroad Company?
   Witness—Yes, for two years<u>?</u>
   Jordan—When did you quit?
   Witness—Why, I get paid up to—
   Jordan—I don't want to know when you get paid up to,
sir.
   Witness—Well, will you tell me this, sir.
   Jordan—No, sir, I'm not under an examination, and
won't tell anything.
   Witness—Then, Sir, I was paid up to the first of May,
but I left off going on the cars some time before that.
   Jordan—Well, it's a mighty small thing to tell, I should
say.
   Witness—Then I can't tell.
   Jordan—Oh, I understand you, sir. Now sir, you must
tell me when you quitted working for the Rail company.
   Witness—I can't tell. It might be in March or April,
but I got paid up to the first of May.
   Jordan—Were you engaged by the month or year?
   Witness—By the month.
   Jordan—Why did they pay you up to the first of May, if
you were engaged by the month?
   Witness—Well, you must ask Mr. Wigham. I suppose
they kept me as an extra hand.
   Jordan—That's all, I believe. Oh no, I want to ask
another question: have you ever been in Pennsylvania
for the last year or two?
   Witness—I've been in New Jersey.
   Jordan—Ah! I didn't say anything about New Jersey,
I said Pennsylvania.
   Witness—Well, where is Pennsylvania?
   Jordan—Well, it's not in New Jersey.
   Witness—Well then, I never was there; I've been to
Newark and up the North River, and about Orange co.
   Jordan—Had your wife ever been to Pennsylvania<u>.</u>
   Witness—She went to Philadelphia once.
   District Attorney—Purdy, how do you know your wife
went to Philadelphia?
   Witness—Oh, Mr. Black said, and the Doctor said she
must go somewhere.
   Jordan—We don't want to know what Mr. Black or
Mr. White said.
   District Attorney—Well, he only knew that she went
away unwell.
   Witness—That's all, sir.
   District Attorney—Had she generally good health?
   Witness—Yes, previous to her premature delivery.
   Jordan—What time did she go to Philadelphia?
   Witness—Why, last summer.
   Jordan—In 1839 were you the owner of a gold watch?
   Witness—Yes.
   Jordan—And chain?
   Witness—My wife had one, and other trinkets.
   Jordan—How long had she been the owner of those
articles?
<d>[Col.4]</d>
   Witness—Why, she had them when I married her. The
chain I bought last summer.
   Jordan—Did you know of her pawning them?
   Witness—No, sir.
   Jordan—What has become of the watch?
   Witness—It is eat up, I believe.
   Jordan—Now, be careful, or you let out something.
   Witness—Well, if I let out anything, you'll catch it up,
won't you?
   Jordan—Exactly so, my friend—<u title="you're">your</u> getting sharp.
   Witness—Well, then, I've not seen it since it came from
Mrs. Restell.
   Jordan—When did you see the rings?
   Witness—I saw some of them this morning.
   Jordan—Now, you've said something about the pawn-
ing business. Do you know of your own knowledge that
the watch was pawned?
   Witness—Well, I <u>dont</u> know how you want to get round
it. I saw what satisfied me, that—
   Jordan—I <u>dont</u> want what satisfied you.
   Witness—Well, then, I didn't know.
   Jordan—Was your wife a lady of property when you
married?
   Witness.—No: she tended store at a confectioner's in
Pearl street.
   Jordan—Are you a married man now, sir?
   Witness—No, I'm not.
   Jordan—Did you live with a woman, or are you in the
habit of sleeping with one, at this time, sir?
   Dist. Att.—He is not bound to answer.
   Rec.—I doubt the pertinency of the question, gentle-
men.
   Witness.—Well, I shall not answer that, at all.
   Jordan.—How large a woman was your wife?
   Witness.—She was not so tall as me by a head and a
half.
   [The witness himself is considerably under the mid-
dle size.]
   Jordan.—That's all, sir.
   Henry W. Merritt called and sworn.—I am one of the
magistrates of the city. I was called upon to take the
examination of Mrs. Purdy. The papers I hold are depo-
sitions taken before me on the 24th of March last, and a
subsequent one on the 22d. They were taken in the
presence of Madame Restell.
   Jordan.—Now, sir, we propose to object.
   Dist. Att.—I only want the preliminary question now,
if the Court please.
   <u>Jordon</u>.—Well, if you reserve our rights, I've no ob-
jections.
   Recorder.—O, of course sir.
   Merritt.—It was taken in her presence, and I told her
she might have counsel. She said Mr. <u>Morrell</u> would be
there, and she would go with me. Mrs. Purdy was con-
fined to her bed, at the corner of Broome and the Bowe-
ry. She was told that she might cross-examine the wit-
ness, and she did put a number of questions to her.
   Dist. Att.—Did Mrs. Purdy answer the questions, and
were they put in the affidavit?
   Merritt.—They were not; I didn't think—
   Jordan.—Well, sir, why not?
   Merritt.—Why, now I remember, it was but one ques-
tion, which she repeated several times.
   Jordan.—Well, sir, I want to know if Justice Merritt
has a right to determine what he will put down? for if
so, the Lord preserve me from Justice Merritt!
   Merritt—Stay till your time comes.
   Recorder—It will become a question by and by, Mr.
Jordan, if the question ought to be put down.
   Jordan—Did you put down the question she put to the
woman?
   Merritt—Not from her mouth; it had been put down
before.
   Jordan—Well, it could be put by no other mouth. She
had no counsel.
   Merritt—Well, it was not.
   Jordan—Did she send out for counsel, to your know-
ledge, sir?
   Merritt—No.
   Jordan—Was it stated that the sole object was to get
her identified?
   Merritt—I <u>dont</u> know that it was so stated, but that
was the object.
   Jordan—Was she told what the object was?
   Merritt—I presume she did know. I've no doubt I told
her so, indeed.
   <u>Morrell</u>—How long after her arrest was it before she
was carried to the Bowery?
   Merritt—Why, she was not carried at all.
   <u>Morrell</u>—Well, before you went there? Was it half an
hour?
   Merritt—I think not.
   <u>Morrell</u>—Was it twenty minutes?
   Merritt—I <u>dont</u> know anything about minutes.
   <u>Morrell</u>—Well, did you not say that it was only for
identification, and that she would not want counsel?
   District Attorney—We propose to read the paper,
now, sir.
   Jordan—Well, we object to it, sir; and I think we are
entitled to the warrant before we go into the argument.
   Recorder—Well, gentlemen, we will leave off now,
and hear the argument to-morrow. Adjourn Court, Mr.
Hays.

   T<small>HAT</small> S<small>ILVER</small> P<small>ITCHER</small>.—Yesterday afternoon, his honor
the Mayor, surrounded by the whole corps of indefatiga-
bles, presented that silver pitcher to the venerable High
Constable, Jacob Hays. His honor made a brief but
touching speech to “the old boy in specs,” and remarked
that he felt a high satisfaction in being made the instru-
ment through whose hands the compliment was to pass,
inasmuch as whilst he, the Mayor, had been connected
with the criminal jurisprudence of the city, he had met
with various instances of corruption and malfeasance on
the part of the police officers, but that not a whisper or a
suspicion of any kind, had ever been cast upon the fair
fame of Jacob Hays.
   The High Constable having received the pitcher, took
a piece of manuscript from his pocket, and read his reply
to the Mayor's speech; thanking his Honor and his staff
officers for the honor conferred on himself. After which
<u title="the">tho</u> corps of indefatigables bade the Mayor good day, and
all went to take a drink.

  COURT OF GENERAL SESSIONS—Tuesday.
   <i>Before the Recorder, Judges Lynch and Noah, and
Aldermen Balis and Woodhull.</i>
   <u>Madam</u> Restell, alias Ann alias Caroline Lohman,
was placed at the bar, charged with a misdemeanor,
in producing abortion upon Mrs. Ann Maria Purdy,
living at the corner of the Bowery and Broome street,
on the 2nd day of June, 1839. Some length of time
was taken up in the <u title="empanelling">empannelling</u> a jury, as the
greater portion of our citizens already made up
their minds as to the guilt of the prisoner. After the
Jurors was sworn in, C. B. Laforge, Esq. as counsel
for Mr. Purdy, husband of the deceased, opened the case
to the jury, and stated that the indictment contained
two counts, one of which was, that the accuses admin-
istered to Mrs. Purdy certain Drugs, for the purpose
of producing abortion, the other was that the accused
had used a certain instrument to consummate the
same. Mrs. Purdy died at Newark, N. J., on the
28th of April last, and the present indictment against
the prisoner was founded on the above charges, in
producing the death of Mrs. Purdy.
   The principal witnesses sworn were the husband of
Mrs. Purdy and Justice Merritt, who took her exami-
nation while in a dying state, which set forth that the
accused had administered the drugs, and used the in-
strument in question. The two different examina-
tions were taken by Justice Merritt, in the presence
of the accused and Mrs. Purdy.
   Mr. Whiting, the District Attorney, proposed to
read the affidavit of Mrs. Purdy, taken before her
death, which was objected to by the counsel for the
accused, as illegal, and they were reserved for argu-
ment until Thursday, 11 o'clock, A. M. to which time
the Court adjourned.

<b>The Court of Sessions, and our Police and
		Criminal System.</b>
   We particularly ask the Grand Jury, now in ses-
sion, to take up the whole system of our Criminal,
Police and Sessions Courts, review all the errors,
follies, vices and corruptions growing out of the
same, and present the whole as a nuisance to the
city. The whole system is wrong, and it is high
time it should be reformed.
   In the police office we have six or seven magis-
trates, (remember that, tax-payers!) heaven knows
how many officers—some forty or fifty; one hundred
marshals, all or nearly all continually presenting hea-
vy bills to the Board of Supervisors—and yet not a man
employed as a preventive police. Indeed, said the Dis-
trict Attorney, if the police officers, &c., put a stop
to stealing and stool-pigeons, under the present sys-
tem, they will starve.
   Let the Grand Jury look at the case of our police
officers disgraced and dismissed; let them look at
the high-handed measures of Justice Parker, for
which he was arrested himself; look at Justice
Wiley's case; look at the Boston robbers and high
constable Clapp, convicted of compounding and con-
federating with a villain; look at one of our police
magistrates, tried, and only not broken because of a
change in the Common Council; look at the sloven-
ly mode of managing our criminal business; look at
the disgraceful anomaly of <i>five Judges</i>, at an average
of four or five dollars a day, each sitting on the Sessions
bench, all to try perhaps a petty larceny thief for
stealing a few pounds of pork—the Aldermen not re-
cognizing their two associate Judges, and the latter
not recognizing the Aldermen; each at one time
prepared—as in the case of Ferris, Lynch and Nash
—to commit each other to jail for contempt, and
wrangling for a chair on the bench of a criminal
court.
	...
   Look at Noah; sometimes he looks as if he was
half asleep for half a day; and then, while his as-
sociate is charging the jury in relation to himself, he
is actually scribbling scurrilous paragraphs for the
“Star,” abusing his brother editors, and even the
Aldermen sitting on the same bench with him. How
very dignified is such conduct in a judge. Can such
a judge be brought into contempt, especially when
we add to it his mountebank tricks on Grand Island,
dressing himself in the soiled garments of the Park
Theatre wardrobe (the Lord Mayor's dress in
Richard the Third) and going ashore, as Ald. Banks
the bookseller, describes him, arm-in-arm with Red
Jacket, singing “Hi Betty Martin,” to take posses-
sion of Grand Island. Then again remember his
trial in the very court over which he now presides,
for breaking the seal of another man's letter. Who
can respect such a judge?
   We ask the grand jury whether such a court can
be brought into contempt? We ask them to re-
member the recent charge of Judge Lynch, in re-
lation to himself and Noah. Governor Seward,
when he removed Recorder Morris, assigned, as the
principal reason for so doing, that Morris charged
the grand jury in relation to himself, thereby pre-
judging his own case. For this, Morris was vio-
lently removed. At that time, Lynch rose, and in
the most coarse and violent manner, told the grand
jury he never heard such an outrageous thing as the
Recorder's charging the jury in reference to himself.
And yet, in the face of all this, he charges the jury to
indict a paper that dared to say what it thought of
him, viz: that he is a very poor lawyer.
   In his recent charge to the grand jury, he told
them they must not hear evidence at all in relation to
a defendant, because it was, he said, contrary to
law. In this, he said what was false. Recorder
Tallmadge says that the contrary is the law of the
land; and he gave a charge to the jury, last term, en-
tirely contrary to Lynch's; and therefore Lynch is
either ignorant of the law, or, knowing it, he wil-
fully told a falsehood from the bench to a grand jury.
Take which horn of the dilemma he pleases, in either
case he is unfit to be a judge. If the grand jury have
any doubts about it, we ask them to look at the re-
cords of the Court of Chancery. If then, they believe
him capable, we ask them to summon the Sessions'
clerk to produce the records of the various criminals
Lynch has let out on bail; not forgetting Butcher
Joe, whom it cost $300 to catch again, and who is
now in the State prison.
   In many cases of felony, in which the Police Ma-
gistrates have refused to liberate on bail notorious,
bad characters, the friends of the felons have taken
them before a convenient legal functionary, termed
“a Supreme Court Commissioner,” by which <i>ruse</i>
the ends of justice have in many cases been defeated.
These occurrences have induced us to refer to the
records in the office of the Clerk of the Sessions, for
the names of the persons bailed, and the Judge who
has been liberal in this mode of dispensing justice to
the people.
   The Clerk of the Sessions has no record which dis-
tinguishes the names of persons admitted to bail by
Judge Lynch, on writs of Habeas Corpus, prior to
the April term. On referring to his record, kept du-
ring the months of April, May and June, we find
that the following persons, all charged with felony,
have been liberated on bail, by this high legal func-
tionary, at his office, sitting as a Supreme Court
Commissioner:—
<table style="white-space:normal;font-size:90%;line-height:90%;">

			<b>General Sessions.</b>
Present, the Recorder, Judge Noah and two Aldermen.
  J<small>ULY</small> 15—<i>Madame Restell's Case</i>.—The fair accused, with
her two learned counsel, took their seats at 11 o'clock,
and the bench being full shortly after, the jury was called
over by the Clerk.
   Mr. <u>Morrell</u> said the first paper he offered to the atten-
tion of the court was as follows:—
<span style="border:dotted .4em;display:inline-block;padding:.2em">   The Keeper of the City <u title="Prison">Pprison</u>, <u title="&o. ?">&c.</u> &c. will secure
and safely keep for examination, the body of
		ANN LOHMAN alias RESTELL.
   (Felony.)				March 22, 1841.
	New York Police Office.
					H. W. MERRITT.
   Officer, G. Hays.	(No. 145.)</span>
   The next was the commitment of Madame Restell to
the custody of the keeper for a felony.
   The next was a notification from John A. Morrill, of
counsel for the accused, to Hyde, the keeper of the pri-
son, warning that officer against the consequences of per-
mitting her to be illegally taken from the prison for any
purpose.
   The next was her protest against the legality of the ex-
amination, and also against her being present thereat
against her wishes and consent. This document was ad-
dressed to the Recorder, Tallmadge.
   William C. Betts called, and examined by Mr. Morrill—
I was a clerk in the office of John A. Morrill in March,
1841. Remember an application to act as counsel for
Madame Restell. I went with the applicant, but could
not find Mr. M. The applicant said Mr. Morrill must come
to the police office, or the Sessions directly, or it would
be too late. It was between 3 and 5 in the afternoon, and
I found Mr. Morrill and went in half an hour.
   John A. Morrill called, and examined by Mr. Jordan—
The moment my clerk had told me that I was wanted to
act as counsel for Madame Restell I proceeded to the po-
lice office, and saw the lady either immediately or in
a few minutes afterwards. I think it was just before she
returned from Mrs. Purdy's.
   The District Attorney objected to any thing that might
have been said after the return from Mrs. Purdy's.
   His Hon. the Recorder held that the question was inad-
missible in relation to the subsequent conversation with
Mr. Morrill.
   Mr. Jordan contended the examination was in violation
of the Statute, and that the whole was a farce from be-
ginning to end, she being deceived from beginning to
end.
   The deposition being <u title="= already">all ready</u> drawn, and the only
question put to deponent being “is it all true as here
stated.”
   Recorder—The District Attorney now offers to read
the deposition taken before Justice Merritt.
   District Attorney—Yes, sir.
   Jordan—No, sir, I deny it to be a deposition taken be-
fore Justice Merritt. It is only a paper purporting to be
in “the Sessions” where Justice Merritt has no jurisdic-
tion.
   Recorder—Gentlemen, I'll call it <i>a paper</i>.
   District Attorney—We call it a deposition, your honor.
   Jordan—Your honor's right it is only <i>a paper</i>, and I'm
particular about it, because the course taken yesterday
was calculated to entrap us.
   Recorder—Let Mr. Morrill proceed.
	...
   Mr. Morrill then cited a case tried in North Carolina on
a charge of a rape, where the deposition of the girl had
been ruled out on the trial, she having died shortly af-
ter making it. Mr. Morrill cited some other cases, and
sat down.
   Mr. Jordan said he intended to take stronger ground,
and show that no preliminary enquiry or deposition
made could be given in evidence if the party making it
was dead.
   Mr. La Forge and the District Attorney were heard on
the part of the prosecution, and the argument had not
concluded when the court rose and adjourned.

   C<small>OURT OF</small> S<small>ESSIONS</small>, July 15.—Before the Recorder, Judges
Lynch and Noah, and Aldermen Balis and Woodhull.
   The trial of Madame Restell was resumed.
   Mr. Morrill, for defence, read the original commitment, by
Justice Merritt, of the accused on the 22d March, for a <i>felony</i>,
for examination; also a full commitment for the accused for a
<i>misdemeanor</i> on the 1st April; also an order of Court for con-
ducting of the accused from the prison to the residence of Mrs.
Purdy, to be present at the examination of Mrs. Purdy, or for
identification; also the protest of Mr. Morrill, one of her coun-
sel, against the taking of the accused to the residence of Mrs.
Purdy.
   It was proved by W. C. Betts, clerk of Mr. Morrill, that Mr.
Lohman called at the office of Morrill to return the latter as
counsel; and witness went and found Mr. Morrill, who proceed-
ed to the Police Office to see Mrs. Restell in half an hour after
Mr. Lohman had called at his office. Mr. Morrill corroborated
the statement of his clerk.
	...
   Mr. Whiting, the District Attorney, followed on the same
side, in an able and erudite argument, tending to show that the
depositions were legally taken, and must by law and precedent
be admitted as evidence. Mr. Jordan concluded the argument
against the legal right to admit the affidavits, in an able and lu-
cid speech, and adduced, as evidence of the rightfulness of his
positions, numerous authorities.
   The Court will decide the question relative to the admissi-
bility of these depositions this day at 11 o'clock.

			<b>General Sessions.</b>
Present—The Recorder, Judges Noah and Lynch, and
			one Alderman.
   <i>Madame Restell's Case</i>.—His Honor the Recorder said
that in this case the jury could be liberated until Mon-
day, as it would certainly take the Court until that time
to make up their opinion on the question of law, involv-
ing a very important principle, which had been submit-
ted to them.
   <i>Sentences</i>.—Ann Foster, a well dressed, middle aged,
lady like woman, convicted of forgery in the third de-
gree, passing bills purporting to be $20 bills which had
been altered from twos, was put to the bar. The Record-
er, in passing sentence, said that it was one of the illus-
trations of the cunning and adroitness of counterfeiters
in the employing of a respectable looking woman, like
the prisoner, and it was known to the Court that the pris-
oner had been so employed for a series of years. Her
crimes were not limited to this transaction—giving false
relations when asked where she had resided, and the ob-
jects she had in view; and it is the regret of the Court
that the prisoner did not inform the public authorities of
her employers, for then, instead of the heavy punishment
falling on the weaker vessel, it would have fallen on the
real offenders.
   The judgement of the Court was, that Ann Foster be
imprisoned in the state prison for five years.
   ...
   Peter E. <u>Bertram</u>, a small, innocent looking boy, tried
for burglary and convicted of a petty larceny, was sent
to dig stone for six months.
   Mary Layton, convicted of keeping a disorderly house,
was adjudged to sit on the stool of repentance on Black-
well's Island for sixty days.
   <u>Bernard</u> Gallagher, convicted of whipping a man, but
he, Gallagher, having a good character, was only mulct-
ed in the sum of five dollars.
   John Graves, for the like offence—nothing said about
John's character—was fined fifteen dollars.
	...
   John Small, “a very good young man,” who had
horsewhipped a very poor young woman in the presence
of Judge Noah, in a most unmerciful manner for not pay-
ing for a glass of liquor which she had drank, was next
paraded, lectured on the enormity of his offence, and
<i>fined fifteen dollars</i>.
	...
   <i>Justice Parker vs. Willard and Wood—Novel Application</i>.
Mr. W. M. Price and Mr. Russell applied to the Court, on
an affidavit from Willard for an order calling on Justice
Parker to show cause why he should not return to Wil-
lard or the assignee of Wood, a sum of money amounting
to $11,000, in notes of one of the banks of this city, a $200
due bill, a gold watch, diamond pin, and other property,
which had been taken from the person of Wood by two
Police Officers, in the presence of Justice Parker, and by
him retained or handed over to some third party. The
affidavit, which was very long, alleged a variety of very
extraordinary matters, and amongst other things, stated
that application had been made for the return of this pro-
perty, but that the Police Magistrate had stated that he
should continue to hold it, because he had the sanction of
this Court.
   At the reading of this part of the affidavit the Recorder
stated that there must be some mistake in it, for the Court
had had no consultation on the matter and given Justice
Parker no such direction.
	...
   His Honor, the Recorder, then discharged the Petty
Jury, with the exception of those sworn on the Restell
case, for the term, and adjourned until Monday.

			<b>Special Sessions.</b>
		Before Judge Noah and two Aldermen.
   J<small>ULY</small> 16.—John Smith and Dan Miller, negroes, for
stealing a brace of hams, were sent to dig stone for sixty
days.
	...
   John Dougherty, for whipping a man, was sent to the
Tombs, for 30 days.
   Mary Ann <u title="O'Kearden ?">O'Keardon</u>, for whipping a woman, was
sent to the Tombs for 30 days.
   William Mack, for violating Matilda Evans in a stable,
and not paying said Matilda, was sent to dig stone for 60
days.
   Some loafers were discharged, and the Court adjourn-
ed.

   M<small>ORE OF THE</small> W<small>ILLARD</small> C<small>ONTROVERSY</small>.—Justice Par-
ker was yesterday arrested on a capias from the Circuit
Court, on an action of damages for false imprisonment,
at the suit of Henry Willard. The damages, in this case,
are lade at $10,000, and Judge Edwards held Justice Par-
ker to bail in $1,000. This freak of Justice Parker's will
cut out plenty of work for the lawyers, that's certain.
We do not know if that will be of much satisfaction to the
magistrate or not.

================================================================
<d>[Col.3]</d>
   C<small>OURT OF</small> S<small>ESSIONS</small>, July 19.—Before the Recorder, Judges
Lynch and Noah, and Aldermen Balis and Woodhull.
   <i>Case of Madame Restell</i>.—At the opening of the Court
the Recorder delivered a long and learned Opinion, in
which both the other Judges concurred, of which the following
are the main points: The question presented is whether the de-
position of Mrs. Purdy taken on the 22d of March, 1841, upon
which a warrant was issued against the accused is admissible
in evidence on the trial of this cause. It is clear from the
statutes that a mere ex parte deposition taken without affording
the accused an opportunity of cross examining the witness, can-
not be read upon the trial. In the present case, however, it is in
proof that the deposition was read over to the deceased in presence
of the accused, and that she, being apprised of her rights,
was also offered the opportunity of cross examining the witness.
	...
the statement of the Justice that the question put had been re-
sponded to in the body of the deposition. The Court was
therefore clearly of opinion that the deposition was admissible.
   Gilbert F. Hays, sworn for defence, deposed that he arrested
<d>[Col.4]</d>
the accused at her house in Greenwich-street, in March, on the
warrant of Justice Merritt on this charge, and took her to the
Police Office, where her husband, Mr. Lohman, accompanied
her. The latter asked witness where he could procure counsel.
Witness told him, and he went for counsel. The accused was
left in the Police Office with witness, and in about five minutes
they proceeded to the house of Mrs. Purdy. Justice Merritt
asked her, before going, if she had any objection to go to the
house of Mrs. Purdy; she answered she had none. Did not
hear Justice Merritt say that the object in taking the accused to
Mors Purdy's house was for the purpose of having her identi-
fied. Justice Merritt told her she was entitled to counsel, and
witness told the Justice that Mr. Lohman had gone for counsel.
After reaching the house of Mrs. Purdy, Justice Merritt told
accused to pay attention to the reading of the affidavit, first ask-
ing Mrs. Purdy “if this was the woman.” Mrs. Purdy answered
“Yes.” The Justice then cautioned Mrs. Purdy, telling her
she was on her dying bed, and to be careful if she had made any
mistake. The affidavit was then read to Mrs. Purdy and sworn
to by her, in presence of accused.
   Cross-examined.—When witness arrested accused, she read
the warrant, and said her name was not Madame Restell. Wit-
ness told her she was the one he wanted. Nothing was then
said about counsel; at the house of Mrs. Purdy the accused
said nothing about counsel; she said something to Mrs. Purdy,
but witness cannot say what it was. The charge was stated to
accused by Justice Merritt at the Police Office.
   Henry W. Merritt, Esq. recalled—deposed that when ac-
cused was brought to the Police, he stated to her in substance
what the affidavit contained. Witness told her that Mrs. Purdy
was sick and confined to her bed, and it was necessary to go up
there. At the house, witness told accused he was about to read
the deposition of Mrs. Purdy, and suggested to her to pay at-
tention to it. It was read, and sworn to by Mrs. Purdy in pre-
sence of accused. After the affidavit was read and sworn to,
the second affidavit was taken of Mrs. Purdy, identifying ac-
cused. I told accused she might ask Mrs. Purdy questions.
   Cross examined—We were at Mrs. Purdy's house from half
to three quarters of an hour. When witness returned, Mr.
Morrill was at the Police Office—told him as soon as Counsel
were ready I would proceed to examine the accused under the
statute. Mr. Morrill did not express a wish to go back and cross
examine Mrs. Purdy.
   Direct resumed—Witness wished the Counsel, Mr. Morrill,
to fix a day for the examination of the accused, and the 24th
March was fixed. On that day Messrs. Jordan and Morrill at-
tended, and in the presence at the accused, witness asked them
if they wished a week to go and cross examine Mrs. Purdy;
they said nothing, declining to answer. Witness then told them
he would proceed to the examination of the accused, and did
so. Judge Lownds was present at the conversation.
   The District Attorney then proceeded to read the depositions
of Mrs. Purdy, some parts of which, viz: conversations with a
third party, (colored Rebecca,) were ruled out. The substance
of the affidavits having been fully published before, it is need-
less to repeat them here. They testify to the fact of the applica-
tion for and the receipt of drugs from the accused, the want of
effect and the subsequent manipular operations to produce the
effect, and the actual production of that effect, contrary to law,
with the resulting deleterious effects to the health of Mrs.
Purdy, the witness.
   Lucinda Van Buskirk sworn—Is a married woman; was ac-
quainted with Mrs. Purdy when alive; saw Madame Restell
once at her residence in Greenwich st.; went with Mrs. Purdy
there in July, 1839, after her miscarriage. Mrs. Purdy wanted
Madame Restell to give her the watch and chain and rings, &c.
which she had left there, without her husband's knowing it.
Madame Restell said she could not give them up until she gave
her the rest of the money, saying 'we have done it very low,
much lower than we are in the habit of doing it, and I have
given $5 of the $6 to the doctor.' She said 'if you had gone
your full time, it would have cost you a good deal more.' Mrs.
Purdy said, 'then I shall be obliged to tell my husband.' Ma-
dame Restell replied, 'Oh, you cannot do that, for it will be a
State Prison offence for you as well as for me.' She did not give
Mrs. Purdy the watch and other articles at that time, but asked
her the number of her boarding house, which Mrs. Purdy gave.
Madame R. Said she would send up for the money.
   Cross examined—Never saw Madame Restell but that time
and now; went to oblige Mrs. Purdy and to gratify an idle cu-
riosity in seeing Madame Restell, of whom she had heard much.
Never went there afterwards. Saw one lady there whom wit-
ness thought was a married woman, who came in and sat down,
and soon after two other women came in and sat down. Two
men also came in, but went away before witness did. Madame
Restell said they had often given her 40, 50, and sometimes as
much as $100, and she had done the thing for $20. Madame
Restell said she would come up to her boarding house and get
the money—she handed each of the ladies a circular to read,
which I have mislaid. Witness did not hear half the conversa-
tion between Mrs. Purdy and Madame Restell. A gentleman
purchased some medicine of accused and gave her $5 for it.
   After a recess of an hour and a half, the Court again assem-
bled at 5 1-2 o'clock.
   Dr. David D. Marvin testified that he was a physician, resi-
dent No. 80 Greene st., that he attended Mrs. Purdy from the
21st to 29th July, 1839. He found her laboring under severe
pains, and it was one or two days after he first saw her that her
child was born, and he was inclined to believe from her previous
good heald and the suddenness of her delivery that it was pre-
mature.
   Cross examined by Counsel for Accused—He was first ac-
quainted with Mrs. P. in the spring of 1838. After her delivery
she recovered, but was more exposed to inclement weather
than is consistent with health, until her sickness prevented her
being out of doors. Mrs. P. was a woman of ordinary intllect,
of fickle disposition, not illiterate for her station, but easily in-
fluenced. She was in the habit of visiting her neighbors con-
siderably. Witness has seen deceased and one Mowbray to-
gether, both in the presence and absence of her husband. She
assigned, on the 21st, severe exertion in washing, as the cause
of her premature delivery, and repeated this once or twice af-
terward within the two days succeeding. He remembers her
once making affidavit with reference to a certain pawn ticket,
and he went with her to a pawn-broker's either in Chatham
square or in Division st. with the affidavit and got a watch, brass
chain and some rings, which she had pawned. [The counsel
were here called upon by the Court to produce the affidavit,
but were unable. The counsel for accused wished to convict
Mrs. P. by it of having sworn falsely.] The watch was given
to witness for safe keeping, because she was afraid of losing it:
it was destroyed by accidentally coming in contact with quick-
silver. The rest of the jewelry entrusted to witness was re-
turned to Mrs. Purdy. Witness has no knowledge of Mr.
Purdy's having been out of the State for the last three years.
Witness does not know that Mrs. Purdy ever went to Madame
Restell's with the watch. Neither witness nor his lady ever
accompanied Mrs. P. to Madame Restell's. The deceased was
able to be about until the winter of 1840. Her complaint then
was pulmonary consumption.
   Here the prosecution rested.
   The defence was commenced, and Mr. Morrill offered ad
evidence the examination of Madame Restell held March 24th,
1841, but it ruled out by the Court.
   Barrow A. Cohen was sworn. Witness attends the pawn-
broker's store of Mr. Levy, No. 5 Division-st., and did in 1839.
Does not recollect Mrs. Purdy or Dr. Marvin. He has an affi-
davit made by the former. [He here gave it, with a paper at-
tached, to counsel for the accused. Mr. Morrill read the pa-
pers. They were a list of articles pledged, as the paper says
Feb. 12, 1839, and an affidavit, signed by Emeline Purdy,
swearing that the pawn ticked for those articles had been lost.
The goods pledge were a watch, pencil case, and two rings,
worth $16.] Witness does not know the handwriting, and does
not recollect positively the articles he gave up at the time of re-
ceiving the affidavit.
   W. W. Purdy testified that he never called at Mad. Restell's
for the goods. He now lives at Harlem, where he keeps a ho-
tel, and has been married since his last examination. Witness
never wrote or caused to be written a letter to Mad. Restell,
nor has he ever called on her to pay money, nor has he ever
said to any one that he would compromise this matter for any
sum of money. Witness has been to newspaper offices to state
that he had been discharged by the Railroad Company because
he had had Mad. Restell arrested; John S. Wigham told him
so. He had been on the car on which he was employed for
some days, and called upon Mr. Wigham, who told him the
President of the Company had said that, as the Restell affair
had made so much noise, and as witness had 'run low' for a
month or tow, (i. e. his receipts were less than before,) they
could not have him any longer. Immediately after this he sta-
ted the fact at a number of the newspaper offices. The Presi-
dent of the Company then requested him to stop the publication
of it, which he did. The reason of his not having collected as
much as others was his wife's illness, which made it necessary
that another man should run his car for him. The President
never intimated that he had appropriated any part of the money
to his own use.
   Dr. Marvin recalled.—Stated that he believed the Commis-
sioner wrote the affidavit presented, which is the one that Mrs.
Purdy carried to the pawn-brokers in company with witness.
   The testimony was here concluded, and on application of the
counsel for the accused, the Court was adjourned to 11 o'clock
this morning, when the summing up will commence.

			<b>General Sessions.</b>
Present—The Recorder, Judges Noah and Lynch, and
			two Aldermen.
   J<small>ULY</small> 19—<i>Madame Restell's Case</i>.—The fair accused
came into Court at 11 o'clock and took her seat at the
table by the side of her counsel.
   The Recorder delivered the following decision as the
opinion of the Court, none of the bench dissenting:—
   <i>The People vs. Restell, alias Lohman</i>.—The prosecution
in support of the indictment, offers to read the deposition
of Ann Maria Purdy, taken before Justice Merritt, a Po-
lice Magistrate, on the 22d March, 1841, upon which a
warrant was issued against the accused.
	...
   Purdy, late husband of the deponent, testified to the
death of Mrs. Purdy on the 28th day of April last.
   It was also proved, on the part of the accused, that the
Magistrate omitted to insert in the deposition, or to an-
nex to it, certain questions put by the accused to Mrs.
Purdy, and her answers to those questions, he alleging
that he did not deem them material, and that they had
been substantially answered in the deposition previously
taken.
   The question that is presented by the argument is: Is
this deposition thus taken, admissible in evidence on the
trial of this cause?
	...
   I am therefore clearly of opinion that the deposition is
admissible.
   Some little dispute then took place between the Dis-
trict Attorney and Mr. Jordan as to the right of the pro-
secutor to re-examine Justice Merritt, but owing to the
noise in the court, it was impossible for the reporters to
hear what was said.
   Mr. M. said that before the deposition was gone into
they had a witness to examine.
   Gilbert Hays, examined—I arrested Madame Restell at
her house in Greenwich street some time in March, on the
charge contained in this warrant. Her husband asked me
where he could get counsel. I told him there was plen-
ty of counsel. She was by. Her husband then left.—
Justice Merritt was in the office, but I cannot recollect if
he was close enough to have heard it. In a few mo-
ments after Lohman started, we left with the prisoner
for Mrs. Purdy's. I should say it was about five minutes.
Justice Merritt asked her if she had any objections to go
up and see Mrs. Purdy. She, Restell, said “No.” I don't
know that any thing was said in relation to identity.
   Jordan—Did he say what the object was?
   Hays—I didn't hear him say what the object was, but I
considered it was for identity.
   Jordan—Did Calender or Merritt say if she was not the
woman she would be discharged?
   Hays—I didn't hear it.
<d>[Col.6]</d>
   Jordan—Did he tell her she had a right to counsel?
   Witness—I believe he did, but I heard nothing about
counsel after her husband went away. I told the Justice
she had sent for counsel. We were at Mrs. Purdy's on
that occasion from twenty minutes to half an hour. Di-
rectly we got there Justice Merritt proceeded with the
business he went on. He told Mrs. Restell to pay atten-
tion, as he was going to read over an affidavit to her. He
asked Mrs. Purdy first, if “this was the woman?” She
said “yes,” and then said to Mrs. R. “to pay attention,”
&c. He then cautioned her to be very careful, and if she
had made any mistake to have it rectified. He then pro-
ceeded to read it. I do not know if another affidavit was
taken. Calender was there, and used pen and ink.
   <u>Jordon</u>—I now understand you to say I've related sub-
stantially all that took place, although I do not remember
every word that was said. Is that so?
   Hays—Yes. I showed her the warrant when I arrested
her. She read it and she said she was not Madame Restell.
I said she was the person we wanted. She said she did
not know Mrs. Purdy.
   Whiting—Did you find her husband at her house<u>.</u>
   Hays—Yes; and he read the warrant. Nothing was
said about counsel until we got to the police office.
	...
   H. W. Merritt re-called by the District Attorney—
When Mrs. Restell was brought to the office I told her
that Mrs. Purdy was sick.
   Whiting—Tell us what you said to her.
   Merritt—I didn't read the affidavit, but I told her in
substance what the charge was, and what the affidavit
contained. I told her that Mrs. Purdy was confined to
her bed.
   Here the District Attorney proposed to re-examine the
Justice as to talk about identity, and if anything was
said, which proposal called up Mr. <u>Jordon</u>, who deliver-
ed one of his aquafortis <u title="philippics">phillipics</u> against the way in
which things were managed by the Police Justices.
	...
   Merritt—I told her up to Mrs. Purdy's that I was about
to read the examination of Mrs. Purdy, and she must pay
attention to it. The examination was then read and
sworn to by Mrs. Purdy. I told her she could put any
question she thought proper. Mrs. Purdy was examined
as to the identity.
	...
   Morrill—Did you state the charge?
   Merritt—Well, I said she was charged with producing
abortion.
   Morrill—Did you not find me waiting at your office
when you came back?
   Merritt—Yes, I believe I did.
   Morrill—Did you not state that she had been taken
merely for identity?
   Merritt—Something of the kind.
   Morrill—Did I not say you proceeded on a very extra-
ordinary errand?
   Merritt—Something of that sort.
   John. B. LaForge, sworn—Mr. Jordan objected to the
testimony about to be given by this witness.
   The Recorder and Judge Noah sustained the objection,
but Lynch wanted it gone into.
   Merritt was then re-called, for the purpose of showing
that at a subsequent period an offer was made of liberty
to cross-examine Mrs. Purdy.
   To this Jordan objected. The court overruled and the
counsel excepted.
   Merritt—The 24th of March I fixed for the examina-
tion of Mrs. Restell, and <u>Morrell</u> and Jordan both came.
I asked the counsel if they wished the witnesses on the
part of the prosecution to be produced.
   <u>Jordon</u>—What did they say, sir?
   Merritt—They did not say any thing, sir. I then pro-
ceeded to take the examination.
   <u>Jordon</u>—Did not you and us go into the private room,
and talk it over?
   Merritt—Very likely we did.
   <u>Jordon</u>—Had you not told us, that you had made up
your mind as to the amount of bail, and did you not say
that you had made up your mind to commit her?
   Merritt—Very likely I did, for I made up my mind when
I issued the warrant as to committing her. I don't know
as to the bail.
   (Here Mrs. Purdy's deposition was read under objec-
tions and exceptions. As this has all been published
over and over again, it would be futile to repeat it.)
   Lucinda Van Buskirk examined—I'm a married wo-
man, and knew Mrs. Purdy. Have seen Madame Restell
once, saw her at the office in Greenwich street. I think
the same person is in Court. I went to her office in
Greenwich street about two years ago last July. We
went about the things. Mrs. Purdy wanted to get the
things without Mr. Purdy knowing they had been there.
I mean the watch and chain and some rings. Mrs. Res-
tell said she could not give them back, because she had
given the money to the Doctor, who had done it very
low. She said she had been sick and obliged to have a
doctor, and Madame Restell said, “Oh, it would have
cost you a great deal more, if you had gone your full
time.” Mrs. Purdy said “she must have them back, for
otherwise she must tell her husband.” To this Madame
replied, “Oh! you musn't do that, or it would be a State
Prison for me, as well as for you.”
   <u>Jordon</u>—How came you to go down with Mrs. Purdy?
   Witness—Why, I'd heard a great deal of Madame Res-
tell, and was very anxious to see her. I had two reasons
for going—one was idle curiosity, and the other a desire
to oblige Mrs. Purdy.
   <u>Jordon</u>—Was there any body else there?
   Witness—Yes, a lady who was a married lady. I'm sure
of that. Then two other ladies came in. Two gentle-
men also came in, but they went off again, and left all the
ladies behind. They then talked about the watch chain
and other things, and Madame Restell stated that she
could not give them back without the rest of the money,
which I think was $20. She said also that it had been
done very low, as they frequently had $100, and the $5
she paid had been given to the doctor.
   District Attorney—Did the ladies buy any of the medi-
cines?
   Witness—No, but the gentlemen did, and paid five dol-
lars for it, too.
   <u>Jordon</u>—Oh, the gentlemen were in trouble then?
   Witness—No, but they had ladies in trouble, I dare say.
   <i>Grand Jury</i>.—On motion of the District Attorney, two
more members were added to the Grand Inquest. About
two hours after, the Grand Jury came into Court with a
number of bills of indictment, among which it was un-
derstood were three charging James Gordon Bennett
with libelling the judicial characters of James Lynch
and M. M. Noah.
   The Grand Jury asked to be discharged, but the Re-
corder refused to comply, because the business before
them was incomplete, many witnesses being yet to be
examined. The Jury then left the Court.
   Their Honors adjourned at half past three.

	GENERAL SESSIONS—Yesterday.
   <i>Trial of <u>Madam</u> Restell, resumed</i>.—At the opening
of the Court the Recorder proceeded to read the deci-
sion of the Court, which was that the deposition of
Mrs. Purdy should be admissible as evidence on trial
of the accused. The first witness sworn was Gilbert
F. Hays, who deposed that he arrested the accused
	...
   Lucinda Van Buskirk, deposed that she went with
Mrs. Purdy to Mad. Restell's, for the purpose of get-
ting the watch and chain she had pledged for the
payment of her bill, the accused refused to give them
up as she had performed the operation at a low price.
Mrs. Purdy said she would tell her husband. Mrs.
Restell said it would not do, as it would be a State
Prison affair for both of them. A number of males
and females were there for advice.
   Mrs. Restell finally said she would take $35, but
would not give up the trinkets, as she had paid the
Dr. $5.
   Nothing was elicited on the cross examination of
this witness which went to prove either the innocence
or guilt of the accused.
   The Court then took a recess until 5½ P. M. The
proceedings after that time we are compelled to defer
until to-morrow.

   C<small>OURT OF</small> S<small>ESSIONS</small>, July <u title="19 & 20?">19</u>.—Before the Recorder, Judges
Lynch and Noah, and Alderman Balis.
   <i>Madame Restell's Trial, continued</i>.—Huron Betts, sworn for
defence, deposed that he knew W. W. Purdy; that he request-
ed witness two or three weeks ago to go to Madame Restell and
ask her if she would give him so much money to keep his wit-
nesses away from Court. He did not name any particular sum.
Witness went with Purdy from the Bowery down Chatham st.,
from Chatham st. to Broadway, and from Broadway down Ce-
dar to the corner of Cedar and Greenwich sts. where Purdy
left witness, promising to meet him at a barber's shop at or near
the corner of Courtlandt st. Witness went into the house of
Madame Restell and saw a woman.
   Cross-examined—Purdy first proposed to witness to go; never
saw Mr. Lohman. Witness knew of the prosecution by seeing
the Recorder, District Attorney and Justice Merritt go there.
Purdy told witness he had got an indictment against Madame
Restell.
   The testimony then closed on both sides. Mr. Morrill com-
menced and concluded an able and forcible summing-up speech
to the Court and jury for the defence. He was followed by Mr.
Jordan on the same side, in an eloquent and argumentative
speech, and Mr. J. B. La Forge and the District Attorney with
great ability and power, summed up for the prosecution.
   The Recorder then charged the jury at length as to the law
and facts of the case, after which they retired to their chamber.
   After an absence of about five minutes the jury returned into
Court with a verdict of GUILTY—on the third and fourth
counts of the indictment, which charge the operation with in-
struments.
   Mr. Jordan moved an arrest of judgement, to give time to pre-
pare for carrying up the case to the Supreme Court, and the
Court gave time to the first day of the next term.
   The accused was not in Court at the rendering of the ver-
dict, nor at any time during the summing up of yesterday.
   The peroration of the summing-up speech of Mr. Whiting,
the District Attorney, was exceedingly eloquent, powerful and
pathetic, and drew tears of the eyes of Court and jury, and
also from his own. He spoke full three hours and a half.
   The Grand Jury came into Court with a number of bills, re-
ceived the thanks of the Court and were discharged. They
found 70 bills during the term, and dismissed 26 complaints.
   The jury were discharged for the term, and the Court ad-
journed to this day 11 o'clock.

	GENERAL SESSIONS—Yesterday.
   Before the Recorder, Judges Lynch and Noah, and
Ald. Balis and Woodhull.
   The Grand Jury came into Court and presented a
number of bills, and were discharged with the thanks
of the Court, for the term.
   In the case of <u>Madam</u> Restell, Mr. Morrill, her
associate counsel, stated that since yesterday, he had
received information that a certain person had been
requested by the husband of Mrs. Purdy, to call on
the accused for the purpose of asking her if he,
Purdy, would absent himself and his witnesses from
the city and not bring the case to trial, if she would
give him a certain amount of money.
   Mr. Whiting the District Attorney, objected to the
testimony being taken, as the whole of the evidence
was closed. The Court however decided that it
should be admitted.
   Huron Betts (sworn,) was requested by Mr. Purdy
to go to the house of <u>Madam</u> Restell, three or four
weeks ago, and ask her if she would pay a certain
sum of money if Purdy would withdraw himself from
the city. He went and saw a lady there.
   The Counsel, <i>pro</i> and <i>con.</i> then commenced sum-
ming up the case, which under the charge of the
Court was given to the Jury at 8 o'clock, P. M.
   The Jury retired and after being absent about five
minutes returned with a verdict of G<small>UILTY</small>. Mr. Jor-
dan moved that Judgment be suspended until next
term, in order that the objections raised during the
trial might pass the ordeal of the Supreme Court.—
The motion was granted, and the Court adjourned.

   The Court announced that the Grand Jury having
found three bills of indictment against James Gordon
Bennett, Editor of the Herald, for libels, he would be
required to give bail to answer in $1000 on each
charge.

<b>The Three Indictments—or Grand Farce for
			1841.</b>
   At the instigation of Mordecai <u title="Manasseh (a.k.a. Manuel)">M<s>anassa</s>h</u> Noah,
formerly Judge in Israel, on Grand Island, now a
Judge of the Sessions, for trying petty rogues in New
York, we have been indicted by the Grand Jury, on
three several bills, for reporting the proceedings of
that Court erroneously, and for bringing two of its
judges, Noah and Lynch, into contempt with the
people.
	...
   Seriously, however, this affair is one of the most
farcical that ever took place. Ever since we started
the Herald, and gave signs of success, Noah, as edi-
tor of the “Evening Star,” has done all he could to
break down our establishment, and destroy our char-
acter. On two or three several occasions, this amia-
ble man, the same who traversed Grand Island in a
tragic costume from the Park, instigated the un-
thinking portion of the press, to denounce the Herald
and its editor. Last year he started and kept up the
“moral war” by every kind of libel and falsehood,
in order to break us down. Failing before this dis-
criminating public, he has, on the first occasion,
seized on a report of a petty larceny trial, issues an
informal edict against our reporter, and gets the
grand jury to indict us for contempt of him and his
talents. Be it so. It will, indeed, be a trial—not a
trial of us—but the veritable trial of Noah and Lynch,
to ascertain whether they have the right or the capa-
city to sit on that bench, and set as they have done.
We deny both, and shall calmly furnish the proof,
under the constitution of the state, which allows
<i>the truth to be given in evidence in all such cases</i>. It is,
therefore, in fact, the trial of Noah and Lynch—no
more—no less.
   The following is a copy of the indictment No. 1:—
<m9>	<b>True Copy of Bill of Indictment.</b>
  (Taken in District Attorney's Office, July 20th, 1841.)
C<small>ITY AND</small> C<small>OUNTY OF</small> N<small>EW</small> Y<small>ORK, SS</small>.
	...
   That James Gordon Bennett, of the City of New York,
editor, printer, and publisher of the New York Herald,
well knowing the premises, <i>being a person of a depraved
and wicked mind, and of a malicious temper and disposition</i>,
disregarding and despising the laws of this State, and
most unlawfully, wickedly, maliciously, and deliberate-
ly, devising, contriving, and intending to traduce, vilify,
and <i>bring into contempt and detestation</i>, the said M. M. Noah
and James Lynch, associate Judges as aforesaid, and to
insinuate, and as far as in him (the said James Gordon
Bennett) lay, to cause it to be believed <i>that the said M. M.
Noah and James Lynch were unfit to preside at the said Court</i>,
and to hold them up to public ridicule and scorn, and to
bring them into ridicule, scandal, contempt, and disgrace
on the 17th day of June, in the year 1841, <i>with force* and
arms</i> at the Second Ward of the City and County of New
York, most unlawfully, wickedly, and maliciously, did
print and publish, and cause and procure to be printed
and published in a certain newspaper, entitled the
“New York Herald,” of and concerning the said M. M.
Noah and James Lynch, so being such associate judges,
as aforesaid, in their office of associate judges, as afore-
said, respectively as aforesaid, and also of and concern-
ing their respective acts and doings as such associate
judges, a certain, false, wicked, scandalous, infamous, and
malicious libel, entitled “Court of Sessions,” in which
said libel are contained, among other things, divers
false, scandalous, and malicious matters, according to the
tenor following, to wit:—
   * Note—Probably meaning steam power.
———
			[Copy from paper of June 17.]
   “ The proceedings in this miserable hole yesterday,
which is called by some the 'Henroost Court,' (meaning
the said Court of General Sessions of the Peace,) were of
little interest. George Rankin, the witness introduced
in Noah's (meaning the said M. M. Noah, associate
Judge aforesaid) celebrated <u title="No COFFEE in Herald-1841-06-17">coffee</u> trial, was tried and
convicted of burglary, in breaking into and stealing cof-
fee from Mr. Merle's store.”
   <u title="And">An</u> in another part of the same libel are contained di-
vers other false, scandalous, and malicious matters, ac-
cording to the tenor following:—
			[Copy from paper of June 17.]
   “ A motion was made and argued at some length by W.
H. Attree, that the Court (meaning the said Court of Gen-
eral Sessions of the Peace) do rescind the order made in
relation to him the day before, because it was, as the Re-
corder said, informal, i. e. illegal, done without evidence
or notice to show cause; <i>was written by Noah</i> (meaning
the said M. M. Noah, associate Judge aforesaid) <i>alone</i>, the
Recorder considering it informal, and the two Aldermen
dissenting from it. The Court (meaning the said Court
of General Sessions of the Peace) will doubtless take
time to consider of it before they (meaning the said Court
of General Sessions of Peace) expunge their illegal
and ridiculous act. We (himself the same James Gor-
don Bennett meaning) shall give full particulars hereaf-
ter. M. M. Noah, (meaning the said Mordecai M. Noah,
associate Judge aforesaid,) <i>the so-called Judge, for a very
short period</i> shook like an aspen leaf, and <i>was as red as an
old turkey hen</i> (meaning the said M. M. Noah was red like
a turkey hen) the whole day, on account of what appear-
ed in the Herald, (meaning the said newspaper entitled
the 'New York Herald.') He (meaning the said M. M.
Noah, associate Judge as aforesaid) denied, like a false
old fool as he (meaning the said M. M. Noah was a fool)
is, that he had any thing to do with the 'Star,' and said
nothing till towards night, when he (meaning the said
M. M. Noah) fell asleep. Mr. Lynch (meaning the said

				“ WHITING, District Attorney.</m9>
   Such is the first Indictment. We desire, there-
fore, the whole country to prepare for this funny,
curious, wonderful, strange, witty, legal, pitiful, far-
cical, philosophical, and poetical trial—not, in fact,
our trial, but the trial of Noah and Lynch for hold-
ing seats on the bench, to which they have no right
under the constitution of the State or the corpora-
tion immunities of this city. Our reporters are all
ready—their lamps trimmed and their lights shining.

			<b>General Sessions.</b>
Present—The Recorder, Judges Noah and one Alder-
				man.
   J<small>ULY</small> 20—<i>The Restell Case</i>.—David D. Marvin examin-
ed by the District Attorney. I am a physician, residing
at No. 80 Green street. In the month of July, <u title="1839 in Tribune-1841-07-20">1837</u>, at-
tended Mrs. Purdy. Found her laboring under severe
pains. It was one or two days before she was delivered,
and I am inclined to believe that it was premature.
   Cross-examined by <u>Jordon</u>—First knew Mrs. Purdy in
the spring of 1838. After her premature delivery she
partly recovered, but from exposure to inclement wea-
ther and other imprudent causes, was again laid up.—
She was a woman of ordinary intellect, very fickle mind-
ed, not illiterate, but easy, and in the habit of visiting
her neighbors considerably. I have seen her with a man
of the name of <u>Moubray</u>, both with and without her hus-
band. She said her premature pains had been brought
on by severe washing. I remember she made an affida-
vit about a pawn ticket, and I accompanied her to the
pawnbrokers for the purpose of getting some trinkets
and a watch which had been pledged. The Court call-
ed on the learned counsel to produce the affidavit. I had
the watch placed with me for safe keeping, but<u> </u>was de-
stroyed by accidentally coming in contact with quicksil-
ver. I do not know that the watch was ever taken to
Madame Restell. Neither myself nor my wife ever went
with Mrs. Purdy to see Madame Restell. Mrs. P. was
about until the winter of 1840—41, and her complaints
was pulmonary consumption.
   The District Attorney rested his case.
   John A. Morrill opened the case for the defence, and
offered the examination of Madame Restell, which the
Court overruled.
   Barrow A. Cohen examined—I am a clerk in the pawn
shop of Mr. Levy, No. 5 Division street; was there in
1839. I do not recollect either last witness or Mrs. Purdy.
I have an affidavit made by Mrs. P. This document was
handed to Morrill, who read the papers. They were a
list of articles pledged, as the paper says, Feb. 12, 1839,
and an affidavit, signed by Emeline Purdy, swearing
that the pawn ticket for those articles had been lost. The
goods pledged were a watch, pencil case, and two rings,
worth $16.
   W. W. Purdy recalled and examined—I never called at
Madame Restell's for the articles left with her. I now
live at Harlem and keep a public house, having <i>been wor-
ried since my last examination in this case</i>. I have often
been to newspaper offices to state that I had been dis-
charged by the Rail Road Company in consequence of
this charge against Madame Restell. Wigham told me
this. The President never charged me with embezzling
the monies of the company. I never offered to settle
this charge with Madame Restell for money. I never
sent any one to her to make such an offer, nor author-
ized any body to go on such an errand.
   At this point of the case the testimony was said to be
closed, but on the Grand Jury coming into Court at a
subsequent period, Mr. Morrill applied to the Court for
permission to examine Mr. Huron Betts, a member of their
body, as to a particular fact deposed to by Purdy.
   The District Attorney said this permission could not be
granted. First, it was irregular; secondly, it was irrel-
evant; and thirdly, the testimony was closed by the
consent of both sides and could not be re-opened.
   The Recorder said that in a case like this even if there
was a little irregularity he should consent to the exami-
nation of the witness, for he should prefer erring on the
side of the defendant, than to shut out any portion of
testimony.
   Huron Betts examined—I know W. W. Purdy. Saw
him yesterday, and have seen him occasionally for the
last three or four months. About three weeks since he
asked me if I would go to Madame Restell's for him. I
said yes. He then said if she would give him some mo-
ney he would leave the city himself and keep his wit-
nesses out of the way also. He did not tell me the price
he wanted. Purdy and myself accordingly started from
the Bowery, and went down Chatham square to Cedar
street, where he said he would wait for me in a Barber's
shop. I went to Madame Restell's house and saw the lady
to whom I delivered the message.
   Cross-examined by the District Attorney—I had known
Purdy long before he asked me to go to Madame Restell.
I don't know Restell's husband.
   The case was here closed.
   Mr. Morrill then addressed the Jury on behalf of the
accused, and went over all the law applicable to cases of
this kind. The learned gentleman cited numerous au-
thorities from the books, and instanced numerous cases,
which he brought to bear on the case before the Court
and Jury, and wound up by a powerful and eloquent ap-
peal to the Jury to exert their judgement, and not permit
either passion, prejudice, or feeling to influence them in
condemning an innocent woman.
   Mr. <u>Jordon</u> followed, in his usual eloquent invective,
and gave one of the witnesses such a dose of bitter aloes
as must have produced a very uncomfortable state of
feelings.
   Mr. LaForge and the District Attorney performed their
parts, and then the Court charged the Jury that the first
and second counts in the indictment were bad, and that
if the accused was convicted at all, she must be under
the 3d and 4th counts, which charge the procuring of
abortion by instruments; and it would become a question
for the Jury, whether that charge was supported. His
Honor then took a review of the case, and left it for the
Jury to say whether the accused was innocent or not.
   The Jury retired for about twenty minutes, and found
a verdict of G<small>UILTY</small>.
   The counsel for the accused moved for a suspension of
judgement until the August term, which was granted.
   And the Court adjourned.

<b>The Great Indictments of 1841—The Real
			Pickwick Papers.</b>
   The publication of the first indictment against the
Herald, for ridiculing Noah and Lynch, which in-
dictment, for distinction's sake, may be called the
great “Turkey Hen” indictment, (as the saying that
a similitude between a highly respectable old turkey
hen and the Judge is the <i>gravamen</i> of the libel) had
produced a wonderful sensation in this community.
Every body is asking—“who was the grand jury that
presented that bill?” “They have outstripped Field-
ing or Dickens in true literary genius.” “These in-
dictments are the real Pickwickian papers—yes,
even Pickwick himself must have been chairman,
and had a hand in them.” God bless this grand jury,
says poor I.
   Be all this as it may, we give on this occasion the
second of these inimitable papers, which, for dis-
tinction's sake, may be called the “Grand Pork In-
dictment for 1841,” and the putting the word (not
the steak) pork into the mouth of a Hebrew judge
is the gist of the charge. [See Laws of Moses—also
Talmud, &c.] Here it is:—
<m9><b>Second Indictment—or the Pork Indictment.</b>
   C<small>ITY AND</small> C<small>OUNTY OF</small> }

   The jurors of the people of the state of New York, in
and for the body of the city and county of New York, on
their oath, present: That long before, and at the time, of
composing, printing, and publishing the several scanda-
lous and malicious libels, hereinafter mentioned, and long
before, and at the several times and occasions, in and by
the said libels mentioned and alluded to, Mordecai M.
Noah was an Associate Judge of the Court of General
Sessions of the Peace, in and for the city and county of
New York, and as such Associate Judge, was duly em-
ployed and engaged in the exercise of his judicial duties,
in the said Court, as such Associated Judge; that the said
Court of General Sessions of the Peace was duly held in
and for the city and county of New York, at the Halls of
Justice of the said city, in the first Monday of June, in
the year one thousand eight hundred and forty-one, and
was continued, from day to day, from the first Monday in
June to and including the fourth Wednesday thereafter,
before the judges thereof; that the said Mordecai M.
Noah presided at the said Court, during the said term, as
such Associate Judge, as aforesaid; that James Gordon
Bennett, of the city of New York, editor, printer, and
publisher of the New York Herald, well knowing the
premises, being a person of depraved and wicked mind,
and of a malicious temper and disposition, disregarding
and despising the laws of this state, and most unlawful-
ly, wickedly, and maliciously, and deliberately devising,
combining, and intending to traduce, vilify, and bring in-
to contempt and detestation the said Mordecai M. Noah,
Associate Judge as aforesaid, and insinuate, and, as far as
in him, the said James Gordon Bennett, lay, to cause to
be believed, that the said Mordecai M. Noah was unfit to
preside at the said Court, and to hold him up to public
ridicule and scorn, and to bring him into ridicule, scan-
dal, contempt, and disgrace, on the sixteenth day of June,
in the year one thousand eight hundred and forty one,
with force and arms, at the second ward of the city
	...
infamous libel, entitled, “Another curious scene in the
Court of Sessions, in which Noah (meaning the said M.
M. Noah), the new judge in Israel, figures largely,” in
which said libel are contained, among other things, di-
vers false, scandalous, and malicious matters, concerting
to the tenor following, to wit:—
				(Copy.)
   “ No stranger should leave this city without paying a
	...
				(Copy.)
   “ On this Judge Noah, (meaning the said M. M. Noah,
&c.,) <i>who is so fat, and sleek, and slippery</i>, that he frequent-
ly almost tumbles asleep on the bench, or looks like it,
which is much the same, roused himself, and cried out—
'<i>Pork! pork! what's that about pork?</i>' The Recorder,
who loves a joke as dearly as any man living, and who
frequently <i>laughs in his sleeve at the ignorance of law dis-
played by his associates</i>, turned round to Noah, (meaning
the said M. M. Noah,) and observed, 'Brother Noah,
(meaning the said M. M. Noah,) as this case of stealing
pork seems to lay legitimately on your side of the bench,
suppose you try it.' 'Pork! pork!' said Noah, (meaning
the said Mordecai Manasseh Noah said 'pork,') '<i>who'd
ever think of stealing pork?</i>' to the <i>great scandal, infamy
and disgrace of the said</i> Mordecai Manasseh Noah,” &c.
&c. &c. &c. &c. &c.		WHITING, District Attorney.</m9>
   Here is a mess of pork steaks, fried and peppered
by the Pickwickian jury, which beats any thing in
Dickens, including Barnaby Rudge and all the num-
bers yet to be published by the New World or the
Brother Jonathan. To represent the venerable and
amiable Judge Noah, as using the word “pork” on
any occasion, is just as libellous as to force pork
steaks into his mouth to allay his hunger. Both are
contrary to the Talmud, which, in book 10, chapter
42, verse 101, sayeth—“He that tasteth pork is a
brute—he that toucheth pork is a beast—and he that
nameth pork is damned.” It must have been an
error, therefore, in our reporter, ever to have repre-
sented the mild and sweet-<u>tem-pered</u> Judge as using
such words.
   To enter into a minute legal analysis of all the
various points in these indictments, would occupy
more time than we can spare to-day. If, however,
to charge those individuals, whose appointments as
judges are not recognised by the Corporation, with
being “red in the face like an old turkey hen”—or
“indifferent lawyers”—or using the terms “pork!
pork!” or any, or all the matters therein enume-
rated—if these are indictable for contempt, what
shall be said of the charges made, within a year and
a day, of Ex-Recorder Morris by all the respectable
papers in Wall street? Can any lawyer answer this
question? “Thief”—“paper snatcher”—“violator
of a man's hearth”—“midnight robber”—and scores
of such epithets were applied to the late Recorder
by the “pipe-laying press<u title="”—">—</u>to a judge too, of whose
authority and appointment no one else disputed—
whose legal attainments all believed. Why have not
the grand jury presented these much more malig-
nant cases? Noah and Lynch are not considered le-
gal or constitutional judges. Their appointment was
predicated on a law which violated the “vested
rights” of the city of New York. It is a sacred prin-
ciple of the whig party that a legislature cannot
annul or change a charter without the consent of
the chartered party, whose rights are touched upon.
This principle has been violated by the last two
legislatures—for to this day the Corporation of New
York refuses to sanction these two appointments.
If Noah and Lynch are not legal and constitutional
judges, what then?
   This we shall examine hereafter.

<b>The Opening of the Third Seal—The Grand
	Coffee, or Tom Ritchie Indictment.</b>
   If the good, old, venerable Recorder Riker be
alive,—
		“Blessings on his frosty pow,”
We trust and hope he will put on his silver specs,
and read these famous indictments from beginning
to end.
   Recorder Riker was a choice one in his day.—
With extraordinary knowledge of criminal law—
great honesty and humanity—he, nevertheless, loved
a joke as he did his own soul—it was his bread, his
butter, his bitters and all. Yet he always preserved
the dignity of the bench and his own reputation,
amid all the shafts of opposition, envy, or malice.
Even the inimitable Halleck himself, gave immorta-
lity to “Dear Dick Riker” in <a href="http://archive.org/details/poeticalwritings00halluoft">his verses</a>, and the
venerable X read and enjoyed them as much as any
body.
   When we supported and recommended Noah for
the seat he fills, we thought and hoped that the
mantle of “Dear Dick Riker” would have fallen
upon him, and that he would have made a truly
great man in mind, as he is in fat. Alas! what a
vain hope! For some cause or other, probably be-
cause the Corporation, “being of a depraved heart,
wickedly, maliciously, and with malice aforethought”
refuses to pay his salary, our old friend and fellow
sufferer gets up indictments against us, of which the
annexed is the third, <i>alias</i> the great Tom-Ritchie,
or wig-shaking indictment:—
<m9>   <b>The Coffee, or Tom Ritchie Indictment.</b>
C<small>ITY AND</small> C<small>OUNTY OF</small> N<small>EW</small> Y<small>ORK, SS</small>.
   The jurors of the people of the State of New York, in
	...
Court, and James Pollock and Frederick R. Lee, Alder-
men of the said city, Judges of the said Court, one James
Ritchie, who stood indicted before the said Court, on a
charge of felony, receiving stolen goods, knowing them
to have been stolen, which goods, it was alleged, con-
sisted of a large quantity of coffee, contained in a large
number of bags, was arraigned at the bar thereof, and
put upon his trial, by a jury, before the said Court, ac-
	...
certain newspaper, entitled the New York Herald, New
York, Tuesday morning, June 15, 1841, of and concerning
the said trial, and of and concerning the said Judges of
the said Court, and of and concerning the said M. M.
Noah, so being such Associate Judge as aforesaid, and of
and concerning the evidence given upon the said trial,
and of the questions put, and observations made, by the
said M. M. Noah upon the said trial, a certain false, ma-
licious, wicked, and scandalous, and infamous libel, en-
titled,
   “<a class="l" href="#Herald-1841-06-15">A curious trial for receiving stolen <u>goods</u></a>.”
   In which said libel are contained, among other things,
divers false, scandalous, and malicious matters, to wit:
“Judge Noah—(meaning to designate the said M. M.
Noah as the person putting a question)—How's that?
Did you, (meaning George Griffin, who was sworn and
then under examination as a witness on the said trial,)
steal the coffee?” “Surprised,” (meaning that the said
M. M. Noah appeared or looked surprised.) “Griffin—
(meaning to designate the said George Griffin as the per-
son answering)—I'll tell you; (meaning the said M. M.
Noah,) the first I (meaning himself, the said George Grif-
fin) saw of any coffee being stolen from Merle's store, was
when I saw George Rankin and Tom Ritchie.” “Judge
Noah—(meaning the said M. M. Noah)—laughing and
looking with a knowing nod and a chuckle towards the
Recorder, (<i>meaning that the said Mordecai Manasseh Noah,
whilst presiding as judge on said trial, was laughing and
looking, with a knowing nod and a chuckle, towards the Hon-
orable Frederick A. Tallmadge, Recorder of the City of New
York, then also presiding as a judge of said Court on said
trial</i>,) what's that you say?—Tom Ritchie?” “Grif-
fin—(meaning to designate the said George Griffin as the
person answering)—Yes, sir, Tom Ritchie.” Laughter,
(meaning that there was laughter in the court.) “Judge
Noah—(meaning to designate, &c.)—Did Tom Ritchie
steal any coffee?” (Laughter.) “Hays—(meaning Ja-
cob Hays, High Constable of said court, &c.) (Angrily,)
Silence in court. Gentlemen, this is no laughing matter,
if Tom Ritchie did steal coffee.” “Recorder—(meaning
the said F. A. Tallmadge,) to Noah (meaning, &c.)—Hays
calls you to order, Brother Noah,” (<i>meaning that the said
Hays had called the said Mordecai Manasseh Noah to order</i>,)
“Judge Noah—Oh, I (meaning, &c.) only laughed to
think that there is so little in the name of citizen Ritchie.
Go on.”
   And in another part of the said libel are contained di-
vers other false, scandalous and malicious matters, ac-
cording to the tenor following:—
   “Noah—Stop—not so fast—I want to get all this down
about Tom Ritchie.
   Griffin—James Ritchie was not present.
   Noah—But Tom Ritchie was. (Laughter.)
   Griffin—Yes. The next time George and I went and
got six bags of coffee; and Tom remained below and took
them.
   Noah—Tom Ritchie was on the ground that time<u>?</u>
	...
   “Judge Noah (meaning, &c.) we (meaning the judges
of the said court) <i>found it difficult to identify the pork the
other day</i>. (Roars of laughter.) And the man was dis-
charged. Coffee kernels are queer things to recognize.”
   To the great scandal, infamy, and disgrace of the
Judges of the said Court, and <i>particularly to</i> the said
<u title="Mordecai">Mordeica</u> Manasseh Noah, &c. &c. &c., and against the
peace and dignity of the people of the State of New
York.				WHITING, District Attorney.</m9>
   Here closes the third and last of these inimitable
papers. Talk no longer of the Glentworth papers—
the indictment papers take the rag off the bush en-
tirely. So exquisite are they, that we should not be
surprised to see some poetic genius transfuse the
whole into poetry, and give them to fame and to eter-
nity at once. In the meantime, we shall call upon
the next Grand Jury to indict the whole Wall street
press, for a worse contempt upon Ex<u> </u>Recorder
Morris.
   Seriously, however, these indictments have pro-
duced such a singular effect upon the community,
that the “Evening Star,” Noah's old paper, for
which he yet writes, has to come to his rescue, and
try to give a tragic air to this curious farce. But it
will be seen that its terrible, violent, foolish tirade,
in only a re-hash of the old falsehoods and libels
which Noah published in the same paper last year.
<i>There is not one word of truth in this tirade, from be-
ginning to end</i>. We could enter into details, but it is
useless and unnecessary. The weak attempt to get
up indictments on such flimsy charges, cannot be
propped up by a whole column of libels. This is the
fourth, the last, and the cheapest edition of the
“moral war,” to put the Herald down—the mana-
ger's last kick, and it will end as that did.

   T<small>HE</small> E<small>LYSIAN</small> F<small>IELDS</small>.—Hitherto Hoboken has on the 4th
of July been pretty much used up for the season; but this
year it grows greener and fresher with each succeeding sun
and shower. Hundreds, who have hitherto gone into the
Country during the dog-days, this year stay at home, enjoy
its comforts, and add those of the Country to them by spend-
ing now a morning and then an afternoon at 'green Hoboken,'
and taking their lemonade amid the deep, delicious shades
surrounding Castle Point. In this way, they enjoy the plea-
sures and health-bearing breezes of the Country without pur-
chasing them at the dear rate of sweating over dusty roads,
up rugged steeps, in shackling vehicles, eating food that the
dog would not touch at home, and sleeping in temporary
quartes that do not bear to be thought of. The change is a
judicious one, and we commend the example to others.

   On Sunday evening, during the thunder shower,
the house of Mr. Stuart D. Howe, in Thirty-sixth
street, near Eighth Avenue, was struck by the
lightning, which tore up several of the shingles of
the roof of the house, but did not communicate fire
to the building. Several individuals in the house
were stunned by the shock. Mr. Howe saw the
ball of fire descend from the clouds, which in an
instant disappeared on reaching the ground. A
gentleman in the upper part of the house was
thrown from his chair, but not injured.

Mr. Armstrong, his wife and three or four children,

in a state of insensibility. Mrs. A. was the first
to recover. On looking about she found that one
of her children, a boy about twelve years of age,
was dead, and her husband so badly hurt as to be
helpless. It is doubtful now if he will live. Three
children abed in the garret room were uninjured.

   C<small>OURT OF</small> S<small>ESSIONS</small>, July 20.—The case of <u>Mad-
am</u> Restell closed in her conviction on the third and
fourth counts of the indictment, which charge the
procurement of abortion with instruments. The
Court charged that the two first counts were not sup-
ported. It occupied the Jury only five minutes to
decide upon a verdict. Motion was made by pris-
oner's counsel that the sentence should be suspended
until the August term; and the Court so ordered.
   In conducting this case the counsel on both sides
have shown great legal skill and industry; and the
court has evinced s leniency to the prisoner which
leaves her on no ground to complain. The husband
appears to have suffered as much by the evidence,
nearly, as <u>Madam</u> Restell, for evidence was addu-
ced that he has made distinct overtures to <u>Madam</u> to
go out of town, and withhold his witnesses for a
consideration.

   A H<small>ORRIBLE</small> M<small>URDER</small>.—On Sunday morning week, Miss
Cecilia Rogers, (who formerly attended John Anderson's
Tobacco Store in Broadway, and was known as 'The beauti-
ful Cigar Girl,') left her home, 126 Nassau-st., for a walk;
and at the corner of Theatre Alley she was met and accosted
by a young man, apparently an acquaintance, with whom she
proceeded toward Barclay-st. as if for an excursion to Hobo-
ken. Nothing farther was heard of her that day by her
friends; and, alarmed by her non-appearance, they advertised
for her in Tuesday's papers. Still nothing was seen or heard
of her till Wednesday, when Mr. H. G. Luther and two other
gentlemen, who were passing the Sybil's Cave, near Castle
Point, Hoboken, in a sail-boat, were shocked by the sight of
the body of a young female in the water. They brought it
ashore, a Coroner's Inquest was summoned, and it was proved
to be the body of Miss Rogers, and it was evident that she
had been horribly outraged and murdered! The Inquest re-
turned a verdict of Murder by some person or persons un-
known.
   We understand that the deceased was a young woman of
good character, and was soon to have been married to a
worthy young man of this City. It is added that suspicion
rests on a young man who has absented himself from the City
since the murder was committed.

   C<small>ORONER'S</small> O<small>FFICE</small>.—An inquest was held on Saturday
on the body of William Henry <u>Plugh</u>, aged 25. It ap-
peared that the deceased was a native of New Jersey,
and worked on board of steamboats. On Wednesday
night he went with a friend to the fire in Desbrosses
street, being a little the worse for liquor. While at the
fire he worked with one of the engine companies and his
friend could not get him away from that exciting amuse-
ment and left him there. Plugh was to have slept that
night on board the steamer Providence, but did not, and
was not heard of until Friday night, when his body was
found in the North River with a cut across the lower
jaw. After a patient investigation, it was the opinion of
the Jury, that the deceased was accidentally drowned
while endeavoring to get on board the steamer. A ver-
dict was therefore recorded in accordance with those
facts.</f>

deed of violence, by which a young and beautiful girl
has been seduced from her home and murdered within
hail of this very populous place. The city was full of
rumors yesterday, got up for the basest and most merce-
nary matters, but on inquiry in quarters likely to be well
informed, we could not find that any of these catchpenny
stories had the least foundation in truth. Some persons
even went so far as to say, that a young gentleman well
known in the fashionable world, had been arrested at a
brothel and had confirmed his guilt to one of the New
York Police, but this, like the other <i title="hearsay">on dits</i>, proved to be
a mere fabrication. Another story afloat was, that the
services of the city Police have been for some days in
requisition, and in order to ensure the arrest of a suspect-
ed person, when in point of fact our vigilant Police were
ignorant of the fatal occurrence until yesterday.

   <b>The Late Murder of a Young Girl at Ho-
		boken.</b>
   It is now well ascertained that the unfortunate
young girl, named Mary Rogers, (who three years
ago, lived with Anderson, the cigar man) has been
cruelly murdered at Hoboken. Nothing of so horri-
ble and brutal a nature has occurred since the murder
of Miss Sands, which murder formed the basis of the
story of Norman Leslie. This young girl, Mary
Rogers, was missing from Anderson's store, three
years ago, for two weeks. It is asserted that she
was then seduced by an officer of the U. S. Navy,
and kept at Hoboken for two weeks. His name is
well known on board his ship.
   Be that as it may, the mother of Mary kept a re-
spectable boarding house, for the last two years, at
126 Nassau st. Here Mary lived ever since the
house was opened, and was the main stay of her
mother. She did all the marketing, and conducted
herself with the utmost propriety. She has not
been at Anderson's hole for nearly two years.—
On Sunday <u title="sennight, se'nnight">sen'night</u>, she left her mother's purposing
to go to church with the children of her aunt, who
lives in Greenwich street. As all the family were
out of town, the aunt does not know whether she
called there or not. The next time she was heard
of was on Wednesday last, when she was found
dead,—murdered,—near the Sybil's cave, at Hobok-
en. It now remains for the mayor of New York and
Jersey cities to do their duties.

   Under our Police head, we yesterday reported the
murder of a young lady of this city, at Hoboken.—
There are circumstances connected with this bloody
deed of unusual atrocity, and we are therefore indu-
ced to call public attention more pointedly to it, than
in our wont with the crimes, of which unfortunately
this city, like all large cities, is so often the theatre.
The unfortunate girl, as far as we can learn, was of
blameless character, but was induced, probably in a
thoughtless moment, to accompany a young man to
Hoboken, where she was decoyed to a secluded spot,
violated and murdered. This could not have been
the act of one; it must have been committed by
more; it has every appearance of having been concert-
ed, and thus almost stands unparallelled among the
deeds of blood of which we read.
   It seems incredible that men could deliberately plan
and commit a murder for such a motive, yet the facts
inevitably lead to the conclusion that this is one of
those unnatural instances of horrid crime, which sets
all reason at defiance. Ten days have now elapsed
since its commission; hitherto the tracks of its fero-
cious perpetrators have not been discovered, and the
blood of the hapless female will probably pass unre-
venged, unless the public authorities evince more than
ordinary activity. It would seem impossible that
their vigilance should sleep on an occasion which so
loudly calls for its exercise as this, yet we much fear
that unless some strong inducements are offered, the
diabolical crime will pass undetected.
   Whilst writing, we receive the following letter from
the Coroner of Hoboken:
	<i>For the Courier and Enquirer</i>.
   C<small>OL</small>. W<small>EBB</small>:—In consequence of the great, though
just excitement prevailing in this community, relative
to the mysterious and desperate murder of Mary C.
R<small>OGERS</small>, at Hoboken, and in answer, once for all, to
the many inquiries addressed to me, concerning this
most wretched tragedy, I must say, that it is far from
my duty as a Magistrate to give information, or to
answer questions of idle curiosity. On the other
hand, I deem it the duty of every individual that has
the least regard for the well being of society, possess-
ing any knowledge in the matter, to furnish me with
all the facts (however remote they may be,) relative
to her absence and her murder.
   In the mean time, I will assure any one, giving
me information, that their communications shall be
held sacred and confidential, until after an interview,
or until restriction is withdrawn.
			With respect Sir, Yours,
				GILBERT MERRITT,
August 2nd, 1841.			of Hoboken.
   N. B. The character of M<small>ARY</small> C. R<small>OGERS</small>, was

be irreproachable—any published slander to the con-

		<m8>Reported for the Courier & Enquirer.</m8>
			POLICE—Tuesday.
   Nothing new has been developed, tending to un-
ravel the mystery which hangs about the fate of the
unfortunate girl, Mary C. Rogers, whose dreadful
end has been already chronicled.
   Mr. Justice Merritt, of Hoboken, came to this city
yesterday to consult with our Mayor and Police Ma-
gistrates upon the best means of detecting, if possi-
ble, the perpetrators of this dreadful outrage, but we
could not learn that any immediate success was an-
ticipated. Blank warrants signed by Justice Merritt,
of New Jersey, and countersigned by our acting
Mayor, Ald. Purdy, have been left in this city, to be
used as occasion may require. The main difficulty
now existing, is the fact that the identity of the per-
son, with whom the unfortunate girl was last seen,
cannot be sufficiently made out to warrant positive
proceedings, and it is hoped that any persons having
any information which may aid the authorities in
their efforts to bring the guilty to punishment, will
come forward at once and give it.
   As some of the papers in this city seem to have
forgotten that <i>de mortuis nil nisi bonum</i> should guide
them now, it is due to the memory of the unfortunate
girl to state that several gentlemen gave evidence be-
fore the Coroner's Jury that she was in every re-
spect an estimable girl.
   Two young men were arrested yesterday by officer
A. M. C. Smith, on suspicion of being concerned in
the murder, but as there was no ground to warrant
their detention they were subsequently discharged.
It remains now for our authorities, and others more
directly interested, to offer such rewards as shall
arouse our officers to use all their efforts to discover
the murderers.<f>
   Officer Tappan yesterday brought up four young
market loafers, who had been detected in stealing a
pocket book, containing $37 in money and about $100
worth of pledge tickets, from a woman who keeps a
birds stand in the Washington market. Two or three
of the gang (for these young scamps work in gangs)
managed to engage the owner's attention, and while
thus employed, some one more adroit than the rest,
made off with her pocket book. They are remanded
for examination.
   A man, apparently a German, who was either ex-
cessively stupid, or excessively <u title="tipsy">tipsey</u>, was brought
in last evening by some citizens, whose limbs and
lives he had endangered by driving on the side walk
in Pearl, near Fulton street. After a severe admoni-
tion from the sitting magistrate, he was discharged,
with a caution not to attempt such feats of horse-
manship again.
   Two or three very small larcenies filled up the ba-
lance of the day; and beyond those, nothing at all
occurred worthy of mention.</f>

   T<small>HE</small> H<small>OBOKEN</small> M<small>URDER</small>.—There were a number of
gossipping rumors and much twaddle afloat again yes-
terday, respecting the perpetrators of this <u title="horrid">horried</u> deed.
It would be worse than useless to give currency to
these mercenary lies, and therefore we refrain from ei-
ther repeating or revamping them. We know, on the
authority of a gentleman who went twice yesterday to
the residence of Gilbert Merritt, the Coroner and Ma-
gistrate of Hoboken, that nobody is in detention on that
side the water and it is equally certain that no person is in
custody here, although two young men were taken before
Elijah F. Purdy, Esq. yesterday on some pretence or
other, but discharged. Blank warrants, bearing the
signature of Judge Merritt, of Hoboken, have been for-
warded to the acting Mayor of this city, and by him en-
dorsed, in case suspicion should alight upon any indivi-
dual. We know this is a dangerous if not an illegal re-
sponsibility for a magistrate to assume, but the emer-
gency will go far in extenuation at the bar of public opi-
nion. It is satisfactory also to know that the warrants
thus endorsed in blank have been confided to the care
and custody of a magistrate, in whose hands they are
safe. From the time which has now elapsed since the
perpetration of this daring murder, we fear that it will
ever remain clouded in impenetrable mystery.

 <b>The Murder of Mary Rogers at Hoboken—
	Crowds Visiting the Scene.</b>
   The excitement which prevails in this city and in
Hoboken, relative to the bloody and mysterious mur-
der of Mary Rogers—the crowds daily hurrying to
the Sybil's Cave, to look on the scene of the deed,
and the shore where her body was first discovered—
are beginning to rouse the attention of the public au-
thorities to this foul outrage upon a civilized com-
munity. The coroner at Hoboken is even waked
up, and has published the following curious note:—
<m9>   C<small>OL</small>. W<small>EBB</small>:—In consequence of the great, though just
excitement prevailing in this community, relative to the
mysterious and desperate murder of Mary C. Rogers, at
Hoboken, and in answer, once for all, to the many inqui-

gedy, I must say, that it is far from my duty as a magis-

   In the mean time, I will assure any one, giving me in-
formation, that their communications shall be held sa-
cred and confidential, until after an interview, or until

		With respect, sir, yours,
			GILBERT MERRITT,
August 2nd, 1841.		of Hoboken.</m9>
   How utterly ridiculous is all this! It is now near-
ly a week since the dead body of this beautiful and
unfortunate girl had been discovered, and yet no
other steps have been taken by the judicial authori-
ties, than a brief and inefficient inquest by Gilbert
Merritt. One of the most heartless and atrocious
murders that was ever perpetrated in New York, is
allowed to sleep the sleep of death—to be buried in
the deep bosom of the Hudson.
   The murder of this girl must have been a horrible
affair. It was late in the afternoon of last <u>Thursday</u>,
that we were taking a walk along the sea shore, in
Hoboken, towards that beautiful promontory where
the Sybil's Cave pours forth its cool waters to lave
the parched lip of youth. It was a little before sun-
set. The last beams of day were struggling through
the groves above the high cliffs, and shedding a rosy
light across the broad Hudson, to New York. We
met several groups of people coming down. A man
stepped up—“Sir, there is a woman murder-
red up yonder.” “A woman found murdered!—
Where? who?” “I do not know who she is. You
will find the poor creature's corpse just beyond the
point and the cave<u>. “</u>Let us go—let us,” said our
companion.
   We proceeded in the direction. The walk is
beautiful. On the left are the steep marble cliffs,
bare in most places, and overhung with deep green
trees of the forest. On the right, the waves of the
Hudson, rippling up the shore with a gentle murmur.
Beyond the promontory, about half way to the Ely-
sian Fields, there is a green bank that the tide em-
braces up to the edge, at high water. Here, after
jumping down from the bank, groups would stop a
while, stoop over the remains of Mary Rogers, and
pass along. When we saw her, she was laying on
the bank on her back, with a rope around her, and
a large stone attached to it, flung in the water. The
first look we had of her, was most ghastly. Her
forehead and face appeared to have been battered
and butchered to a mummy. Her features were
scarcely visible, so much violence had been done to
her. On her head she wore a bonnet—light gloves
on her hands, with the long watery fingers peering
out—her dress was torn in various portions—her shoes
were on her feet—and altogether, she presented the
most horrible spectacle that eye could see. It al-
most made our heart sick, and we hurried from the
scene, while a rude youth was raising her leg, which
hung in the water, and making unfeeling remarks on
her dress.
   We hastened from the scene. The coroner's jury
was held afterwards, and the result is known.
   Since that day, the crowds flocking to Hoboken
have been immense, and the legends circulated have
been innumerable. Only a few days ago, it is sta-
ted that a poor young man committed suicide, in
the woods above the Elysian Fields. The other day
a man fired a pistol on his wife, who barely escaped
with a deep laceration. All the unfortunate beings
that crowd a large city, seem to go to Hoboken to
get red of their sorrows, or rid of their lives. The
beauty of its groves—the picturesqueness of its cliffs
and creeks—the deep mystery of its wild woods
seem to charm all unfortunates to find their solace
there. It was but the other evening, that, while
wandering ourself under the frowning cliff, with the
big, bright, broad moon, just rising over New York,
and tipping with silver her spires and steeples, that
a poor youth accosted us—“Gentleman, will you
give money to pay my ferriage? I can find now work,
nor have I any thing to eat.”
   We have not heard where Mary Rogers has been
buried.

		<m8>[Reported for the Courier & Enquirer.]</m8>
   <i>The Case of Mary C. Rogers</i>.—Notwithstanding the
vigorous efforts of the authorities here and in New-
Jersey, we regret to state that no clue has as yet been
discovered to the perpetrators of this dreadful tragedy.
The two young men who were arrested here have
been examined and nothing being elicited to warrant
their detention, they were discharged. Justice Mer-
ritt, of Hoboken, caused a young man in Jersey City
to be arrested on suspicion, but after a tedious and
protracted examination he was discharged on Tuesday
night.
   Justice Merritt has addressed a letter to Governor
Pennington, of New-Jersey, and there is no doubt
that he will at once offer a suitable reward for the de-
tection of the murderers. Our Mayor is only await-
ing the action of Gov. Pennington in the premises,
as he conceives that the first offer of a reward should
come from him.
   In a conversation with Dr. Cook, of Hoboken, we
learned that the body of the unfortunate girl showed
evident marks that the most brutal violence had been
restored to, one of her wrists having been clasped so
tightly, as to leave a mark as of a rope. There were
besides other marks and bruises, showing that the
poor girl had fallen into the hands of some worse than
brutes. It is now generally supposed that the de-
ceased was thrown from the cliff near the Sybil's
Cave, and that the marks on her face were not made
by fists, as was at first supposed, but by coming in
contact with the rocks in her fall.
   As the public mind is generally and justly excited
on this subject, we have transcribed and annex here-
with the main part of the evidence adduced before the
Coroner's Jury, suppressing only such portions as
would, by being made public, interfere with the ends
of justice.
   Since writing the above, officers John Davis and
Colvin have arrested a young man (whose name it is
not necessary to mention,) on suspicion of being con-
cerned in the murder. He was examined, but imme-
diately sent on board the U. S. ship North Carolina,
on board which ship he enlisted the day the body was
found, there being no evidence to warrant his deten-
tion.
		J<small>ULY</small> 28th, 1841—8 o'clock, P. M.
   An inquisition taken at Castle Point, Hoboken, on
the body of a female, found fastened by a rope and
stone, near the shore—by a jury of thirteen men
duly summoned and qualified by Gilbert Merritt, a
Justice of the Peace—
   When Alfred <u>Cromeline</u>, was duly sworn, saith,
that he recognises the deceased, and was well ac-
quainted with her. That her name is Mary C. Rogers,
a resident of No. 126 Nassau street, New York. That
he has known her for a considerable time—having
boarded in her mother's house about six months—
while deceased was the officiating manager of the
family and the main support of an infirm and aged
mother—with the whole charge of conducting the
boarding house.
   Cross-examined by the Justice. The deceased was
seldom in the habit of going out on the Sabbath, ex-
cept to church, and then, not frequently with young
men. Witness is unable to account for her being at
Hoboken on Sunday, the 25th of July, except
decoyed there by artifice. The deceased was
formerly much attached to a young man in New
York,—but has some time since discarded him.
I had no knowledge of her going to Hoboken on the
25th of July—was generally at home and domestic.
To whom was she attached? She was for some time
attached to Mr. *******, but for some time past has
rejected him, and is now attached to Mr. *******, to
whom it was supposed she would have been married.
The deceased has, during the whole time the witness
has known her, borne an irreproachable character for
chastity and veracity. She was amiable and pleas-
ing, and rather fascinating in her manners. Never
heard her virtue questioned in the least.
   Archibald Padley being sworn, saith—The deceased
has a strong resemblance to and no doubt is Mary
C. Rogers; that he has boarded in the house with
Mary C. Rogers, No.126 Nassau street, New York;
that she was a worthy girl, of irreproachable charac-
ter, was attached—[similar to former witness]—had
heard that she was at Hoboken on Sunday, the 25th
of July, but has no knowledge of her associates or
company on that occasion; and that the deceased has
been absent since some time on Sunday last, which
has caused great anxiety and alarm in the family.
Has no knowledge of hostile feeling or ill-will on the
part of any one towards deceased. She was respect-
ed and much esteemed. Cross-exam. Cannot ac-
count for the cause of her absence or murder.
   John Bertram, being sworn—first saw the body
between 3 and 4 o'clock, P. M. in the River, a short
distance from the shore. Was not acquainted with
the deceased—nor had he any knowledge of the mur-
der.
   William Waller, being sworn—saith, that he first
saw the body about half past three o'clock, P.M.,
and caused it to be secured by a rope and stone, until
the Coroner or Justice could be seen. Cross-exam-
ined. Has no knowledge of the deceased—or the
cause of her murder.
   Richard F. Cook—when it was proposed, that Doc-
tor Cook's testimony should be written out by him-
self—and that he, together with Abraham L. Van
<u>Boskirck</u>, two of the jurors, should particularly exam-
ine the whole body, and report the result of such ex-
amination to the inquest, which proposition was duly
accepted by the same, and after a reasonable time, the
deputation reported to the inquest—that “in the per-
formance of their duty, that from marks and bruises,
and * * * * * there were evident signs of the body
having been violated; that * * * * *; and that, the
bruises about the head and face, as well as * * *
* * was sufficient to cause death. * * * .” (<i>a</i>)
   The verdict, as recorded, in the Clerk's office of the
county of Hudson, New Jersey. Signed by the
Magistrate and thirteen Jurors.
   (<i>a</i>) Dr. Cook's written testimony is in the posses-
sion of the Justice, and can be seen by proper appli-
cants, and only such.
   The testimony withheld, the magistrate deems
improper to publish.

   T<small>HE</small> M<small>URDER AT</small> H<small>OBOKEN</small>.—Three individuals were
yesterday arrested, charged with being concerned in the
atrocious murder of Mary C. Rogers. The grounds of
this arrest did not transpire, but the result of a private
examination, which was fixed for an hour subsequent to
the meeting of the Common Council, was the discharge
of all the accused.

   Miss Mary <u>Ann</u> Rogers, well known as "the beau-
tiful cigar girl," who attended Anderson's cigar
shop on Broadway, New York, left her home on
Sunday for the purpose of going to church, as she
stated. She did not return, and two or three days
afterwards her body was found in the river, with
the appearance of having undergone brutal treat-
ment. The Coroner's jury returned a verdict of
wilful murder by some person unknown. Suspi-
cion rests upon a young man who has fled the city.
Miss Rogers is said to have been of good character
and was to have been married soon.

   T<small>HE</small> H<small>OBOKEN</small> M<small>URDER</small>.—Yesterday afternoon a fur-
ther examination was held before Justice Merritt and
Parker into the charge brought against the young man
who was suspected of participating in the murder of
Mary Rogers, from the fact of his having entered as a
seaman on board the U. S. ship North Carolina, and go-
ing to do his duty the next day. The circumstances
which are said to implicate this man, are first, that he is a
relation of John Anderson, the cigar man, and had boar-
ded with Mary's mother. He admits the knowing of
Mary, but says very frankly that the last time he saw
her was before he went to New Bedford. That he was
there the day the deed was committed, and returned to
this city on the 27th from Boston. The same day he
went to a shipping agent and said he wanted to ship. The
man said in reply something about it being impossible to
get a ship that night and the next day, which was the
28th, the accused went to the Rendezvous, and enlisted,
got his fit out, with his advance money, and went on
board the same afternoon. This is said to have been the
day the body was discovered, and because sailors do not
usually go to their duty until they have spent their ad-
vance money, this is taken as <i>one very suspicious circum-
stance</i>.
   He denied ever taking Mary out, or having been in the
habit of going out with young men who did. He says
that he never asked her to go out, because he had a girl
whom he was attached to, and he took her out if he took
any one. He says that he always had enough of rowing
and sailing in boats when at sea or on service, and con-
sequently had no inclination to go on the river in boat-
ing excursions when on the shore. He did not go out in
any small boat on Sunday week, and he asserts that he
has <i>not been to Hoboken at all</i> for more than a year.
   On the other hand, John R. Robinson, of 319 Water
street, the shipping agent and boarding house keeper, to
whom this young man applied for a ship on the 27th,
produces a pair of blue canvass trousers and a jack knife,
such as used by sailors, which Robinson says this young
man left behind him. These articles are said to be
stained with something, but with what it would be diffi-
cult to say.
   Then again the appearance, deportment, and mode of
answering questions put to him, and the quiet manner
of this young fellow, are all in his favor. His eye does
not quail nor his cheek blanch while under examina-
tion, and it was the opinion of the police magistrate and
of the majority of the persons admitted to the examina-
tion, that there was no foundation for the charge. Being
of this opinion, we shall not publish his name, unless
there is something more adduced against him.
   As to the other two young men who were arrested on
Wednesday, it is now confidently asserted that their ar-
rest was brought about by the basest and most malignant
means. If this is the case, it is to be hoped that the
grand jury will immediately present the cause thereof
to a public nuisance.<f>
 C<small>ORONER'S</small> O<small>FFICE</small>.—An inquest was held at No. 330
Water street, on the body of Ellen Long, a native of Ire-
land, aged <u title="Age is from Tribune-1841-08-06">32</u>—had been an habitual drunkard for many
years, and died from the effects of her intemperate habits.
Verdict accordingly.
   The Coroner was summoned in the afternoon, to the
loot <s>of 16</s>th street, and had not returned when our re-
porter left the Egyptian Tombs.</f>

   M<small>URDER OF</small> M<small>ARY</small> R<small>OGERS AT</small> H<small>OBOKEN</small>.—This
awful atrocity still continues to be agitated among
all classes. The following is a report of the Coro-
ner's Inquest at Hoboken:—
			I<small>NQUEST</small>.
	H<small>OBOKEN</small>, July 28th, 1841—8 o'clock P.M.
   An inquisition taken at Castle Point, Hoboken, on the
body of a female, found fastened by a rope and stone,
near the shore—by a jury of thirteen men, duly sum-
moned and qualified, by Gilbert Merritt, a Justice of the
Peace—
   When Alfred <u>Cromeline</u>, was duly sworn, saith, that
he recognises the deceased, and was well acquainted
with her. That her name is Mary C. Rogers, a resident
of No. 126 Nassau street, New York. That he has known
her for a considerable time—having boarded in her mo-
ther's house about six months—while deceased was the
officiating manager of the family, and the main support
of an infirm and aged mother—with the whole charge of
conducting the boarding house.
   Cross-examined by the Justice. The deceased was
seldom in the habit of going out on the Sabbath, except
to church, and then, not frequently with young men.—
Witness is unable to account for her being at Hoboken
on Sunday, the 25th of July, except decoyed there by
artifice. The deceased was formerly much attached to a
young man in New York—but has some time since dis-
carded him. I had no knowledge of her going to Hobo-
ken on the 25th of July—was generally at home and do-
mestic. To whom was she attached? She was for some
time attached to Mr. *******, but for some time past has re-
jected him, and is now attached to Mr. *******, to whom
it was supposed she would have been married. The de-
ceased has, during the whole time the witness has known
her, borne an irreproachable character for chastity and
veracity. She was amiable and pleasing, and rather fas-
cinating in her manners. Never heard her virtue ques-
tioned in the least.
   Archibald Padley being sworn, saith—The deceased
has a strong resemblance to, and no doubt is Mary C. Ro-
gers; that he has boarded in the house with Mary C. Ro-
gers, No.126 Nassau street, New York; that she was a
worthy girl, of irreproachable character, was attached—
[similar to former witness]—had heard that she was at
Hoboken on Sunday, the 25th of July, but has no know-
ledge of her associates or company on that occasion; and
that the deceased has been absent since some time on
Sunday last, which has caused great anxiety and alarm
in the family. Has no knowledge of hostile feeling or
ill-will on the part of any one toward the deceased. She
was respected and much esteemed.
   Cross-examined—Cannot account for the cause of her
absence or murder.
   John Bertram, being sworn—first saw the body be-
tween 3 and 4 o'clock, P. M. in the river, a short distance
from the shore. Was not acquainted with the deceased,
nor had he any knowledge of the murder.
   William Waller, being sworn, saith—that he first saw
the body about half past three o'clock, P.M., and caused
it to be secured by a rope and stone, until the Coroner or
Justice could be seen.
   Cross-examined—Has no knowledge of the deceased,
or the cause of her murder.
   Richard F. Cook—when it was proposed, that Doctor
Cook's testimony should be written out by himself, and
that he, together with Abraham L. Van <u>Boskirck</u>, two of
the jurors, should particularly examine the whole body,
and report the result of such examination to the inquest,
which proposition was duly accepted by the same, and
after a reasonable time the deputation reported to
the inquest—that “in the performance of their duty, that
from marks and bruises, and * * * * * there were evident
signs of the body having been violated; that * * * * *; and
that, the bruises about the head and face, as well as * * *
* * was sufficient to cause death. * * * .”
   The verdict, as recorded, in the Clerk's office of the
county of Hudson, New Jersey. Signed by the Magis-
trate and thirteen Jurors.
   From this evidence it seems probable that after the
poor girl was violated, she was thrown from the high
cliffs near Castle Point, and thus precipitated into the
water. There must have been several to perpetrate
this foul outrage. Can no discovery be made of the
felons?

   ☞ The terrible Murder of Miss Rogers excites daily a
deeper and wider interest in our city. Well may it do so.—
A young woman leaves her home on Sunday morning, and is
unheard of till the following <u>Thursday</u>, when she is found
horribly outraged and murdered at Hoboken. A week has
since passed, and no clue to the perpetrator of the awful
crime is yet found. Our police are now on the alert, but we
fear too late. What has the Mayor been doing? We hear
that he awaits the offer of a reward from the Governor of
New-Jersey before offering one himself. This is wrong.
The criminal, probably, no more than the victim, belonged to
New-Jersey; the offence strikes at the safety and peace of
the citizens of New-York.—Who saw Miss Rogers at Hobo-
ken on Sunday week? Will any one who did, and hesitates
to go before the Police, please address a note stating the
facts to this office?

   A<small>RREST ON</small> S<small>USPICION OF</small> M<small>URDER</small>.—Yesterday a young
man, a seaman attached to one of our National vessels, was ta-
ken before Justice Parker of the Police for examination touch-
ing his <u title="= participation">participancy</u> in or knowledge of the murder of Miss
Mary Cecilia Rogers. He was supposed to be the person
whom two gentlemen saw walking with Miss Rogers on Sun-
day afternoon or evening; but although he was well acquainted
with the unfortunate young lady, the two gentlemen, on seeing
him, said at once that he was not the man. After long and
critical interrogatories by the Magistrate, in which nothing to
implicate him was elicited—he was discharged. Mystery, there-
fore, still broods over this dark tragedy, though some of the
Police Officers are constantly on the alert to find out and arrest
the murderer. It is stated that the Governor of New-Jersey is
about to offer a reward for the discovery and arrest of the au-
thors of the bloody deed.

   C<small>ORONER'S</small> O<small>FFICE</small>.—The Coroner yesterday held an inquest
at 330 Water st. on the body of Ellen Long, a native of Ireland,
aged 32 years. The deceased was very intemperate, and had
indulged in excessive drink for a considerable time past. Her
husband left home on Wednesday morning and returned about
<u title="5 in EVENING POST">7</u> o'clock in the evening, when he found her stretched out on
the floor, entirely dead. Dr. W. S. Tompkins executed a post
mortem examination on the body and found the mucus coat of
the stomach, also the intestines much congested, as in cases of
confirmed intemperance, and from his advisory statement, the
jury found a verdict of died from intemperance.
   Also, at the corner of 10th avenue and 16th street, on the
body of Robert Lynn, a native of Ireland, aged 31, a milkman
by occupation. The deceased, in a state of apparent health, on
Tuesday night at 11 o'clock retired to a hay loft in the 10th
avenue, where he was wont, in warm weather, to sleep, and
where he was found dead on Wednesday morning. Dr. W.
S. Tompkins made a post mortem examination, and from the
state of the brain, liver, heart, &c. deduced the opinion that the
deceased died of congestion of the brain and lungs. Verdict
accordingly.
   Also, at the foot of Clarkson st. on the body of a dead infant:
found in the water at the foot of said street. Verdict, still born.

			POLICE.
   <i>The Case of Mary C. Rogers</i>.—The young man
from the North Carolina who was arrested on suspi-
cion of being concerned in this dreadful affair, was
yesterday brought up again before the Magistrates, it
having been supposed that he could be identified as
the person with whom the deceased was seen on
Sunday morning when she was last seen alive.
   Several persons were there for that purpose, but
they failed to identify him, and he was sent again on
board the North Carolina.
   The circumstances which led to his arrest, are
these: His brother (it is not deemed necessary to
mention their names) was engaged to, or addressing
the deceased, and as the accused was known to have
lived in the house, search was made for him, and he
was found on board the North Carolina, where he
had shipped on the 28th ult. (the day the body was
found) and contrary to the usual custom of sailors,
he was apparently very anxious to get on board the
ship, and was at once sent on board.
   He underwent a pretty close examination by Justice
Parker, as to his habits, occupation and whereabouts,
for the last few weeks, to which he gave pretty fair
answers. He asserted that he had not seen the de-
ceased since the 3d of July, when he staid a short
time at her mother's house, and that so far from
being on intimate terms with her, he had never walk-
ed out with her in his life.
   If anything should occur which will render his
presence again necessary, he can be readily found on
board ship, but it is the opinion of a gentleman at the
Halls of Justice, well versed in all the art of rogue
catching, that this person is entirely innocent.<f>

   T<small>HE</small> M<small>URDER OF</small> M<small>ARY</small> C. R<small>OGERS</small>.—The in-
vestigations of the police are still going on with a
view of discovering the authors of the murder of
this young woman, whose body was found the other
day at Hoboken.
   There is no probability, it appears to us, that
the crime was committed at Hoboken. It is not
likely that a girl like her, of good reputation and
modest manners, could have voluntarily remained
there to a late hour in the evening, and unless that
were the case, there could have been no opportuni-
ty of committing the murder without alarm and
discovery. It is more likely that she was decoyed
into some of the retreats of infamy in this city,
places of surer concealment than any to be found
at Hoboken, that she was there violated and mur-
dered, her body thrown into the river, and after-
wards washed to the Hoboken shore. The testi-
mony given at the Coroner's inquest, the whole of
which is not of a nature to publish, establishes, in
the strongest manner, the purity of the girl's char-
acter, and adds to the horror of the deed which
has been committed. We find the following para-
graph in the Express of this morning:
   A<small>RREST ON</small> S<small>USPICION OF</small> M<small>URDER</small>.—A young
sea faring man, belonging to one of the United
States vessels here, was yesterday arrested and ta-
ken before Justice Parker, of the Police Office, for
examination, touching his participating in, or
knowledge of the death, by murder, of Mary Ceci-
lia Rogers. He was a former acquaintance of the
young lady, and was supposed to be person
who was seen in her company on the afternoon of
her death. Two gentlemen who had seen the lat-
ter, on seeing the prisoner, said at once he was not
the man—and after a long and critical examination
by the magistrate he was discharged, to return on
board his ship. The affair is still enveloped in
mystery; but the officers, or some of them at least,
are continually on the alert to discover and arrest
the murderer if possible. It is understood that
Governor Pennington is about to offer a reward for
the discovery and arrest of the murderer.

ten miles from Glasgow, Scotland, and according to her own
account, was treated so harshly by a step-father that she de-
termined at any and every risk to leave the country. She
started from home with but little money and few clothes.
The latter she sold and obtained a boy's suit. She was in
Liverpool several days looking out for a vessel, and during
the whole time readily <u title="succeeded">succeeeded</u> in deceiving those with
whom she came in contact as to her true character. She
got on board the Algonquin without the knowledge of her
officers, and did not make her appearance until the vessel
was fully under way. She then presented herself, and said
she had been a drummer in a Scotch regiment, and was treat-
ed with such severity that she determined to make her escape.
For the first few days she mingled freely with the sailors,
and once or twice slept in a berth with one without the slight-
est suspicion on his part as to the sex of his companion. In-
deed, she is described as decorous in her manner, modest in
her deportment, and exceedingly anxious to avoid any thing
improper, either in language or in action. At home, she
was employed as a housemaid at a shilling per week. Sev-
eral persons who have conversed with her, state that the im-
pression made by her answers and deportment was quite fa-
vorable. She is not handsome, but has a healthy appear-
ance, with a frank, good-humored face. No love story is
connected with her adventure. She has already obtained
employment in a respectable family in this city, and appears
delighted with her situation. On shipboard she went aloft
several times, and was nimble, active and fearless. She had
no clothes whatever but the dress she wore. Capt. Turley's
conduct to her, while on board, was humane and praisewor-
thy throughout.			[Philadelphia Inquirer.</f>

	<b style="font-size:120%;letter-spacing:.15em">IMPRISONMENT OF VAGRANTS.</b>
		OPINION OF THE COURT OF SESSIONS.
   The summary Imprisonment of dissolute and vicious per-
sons by our Police Justices under a general charge of Va-
grancy had deservedly attracted much attention from the Bar
and the Public. On the one hand, it has been claimed as
necessary to the preservation of Morality and Order; on the
other, denounced as dangerous to personal liberty. It must
be obvious to all that such a process is liable to the grossest
abuses, and ought to be very carefully guarded; while, as a
prop to Public Morals, it seems to us exceedingly imper-
fect and unsafe one.
   A case of this kind came up before the Court of Sessions
yesterday, in which, after hearing, Judge L<small>YNCH</small> delivered
the Opinion of the Court, as follows:
<m9>   C<small>OURT OF</small> S<small>ESSIONS</small>—In the matter of <u title="'Matilda' in Herald-1841-08-14">Melinda</u> Hoag, on Habeas
Corpus. Opinion of Judge Lynch.
   The prisoner is brought before me on a Habeas Corpus directed to
the keeper of the City Prison, to which he has returned that he de-
tains her by virtue of a commitment which is in the words following:
   C<small>ITY AND</small> C<small>OUNTY OF</small> N<small>EW</small> Y<small>ORK, SS</small>.—By George W. Matsell, Esq.,
one of the Special Justices for preserving the peace in the City of
New-York, to the Constables and Marshals of the said City, and every
of them, and to the Keeper of the Penitentiary, of the City of New-
York: These are in the name of the People of the State of New-York
to command you, the said Constables and Marshals, to convoy to the
said Penitentiary the body of Melinda Hoag, who stands charged be-
fore me with being a vagrant, viz. an idle person and a common pros-
titute, who, not having visible means to maintain herself, lives
without lawful employment, and whereof she is convicted on
competent testimony. And you, the said Keeper, are hereby com-
manded to receive into custody, in the said Penitentiary, the body of
the said Melinda, and her safely keep for the space of six months, or
until she shall be thence delivered by our course of law.
Given under my hand and seal, this 20th day of July, in the year of
   our Lord one thousand eight hundred and forty-one.
		Copy.		(Signed)		GEO. W. MATSELL.
   The Counsel for the prisoner contends that the prisoner should be
discharged on the ground that the commitment is void for defects ap-
pearing on the face of it.
   1st. That the signature is by Geo. W. Matsell, without stating his
official capacity.
   2d. That the offence of which the prisoner is convicted is not stated
with sufficient precision, and is not within the terms of any statute
defining what constitutes a vagrant.
   3d. That there is no seal to the warrant, although it is stated that
it is under seal.
   4th. That it does not appear by the commitment whether it was
upon confession of the party or competent testimony, and that if on
the latter, the names of the witnesses and their testimony should have
been stated.
   5th. That there is no statement of any adjudication that the pri-
soner was an improper person to be sent to the Alms-House, or that
she was a notorious offender and not a proper object of relief.
   1. There is no force in the first objection. In the body of the com-
mitment George W. Matsell is described as one of the Special Justi-
ces for preserving the Peace in the City of New-York, which is a suf-
ficient allegation of his authority, and it was not necessary to affix to
his signature his official character.
   2. The offence stated in the commitment is that the prisoner is a
<i>vagrant</i> viz: “an idle person and a common prostitute, who, not hav-
ing visible means to maintain herself, lives without lawful employ-
ment.” As the Justice has undertaken to define in the warrant the
particular species of vagrancy of which the prisoner was convicted,
it must appear to be one of the cases which is specified by the statute,
and if it appears that it is not with any of the cases so specified, not
only the commitment but the conviction itself would be void. By the
Revised Statutes, Sec. 1st, Tit. 2d of chap. 20 of part 1st, “all idle
persons who not having visible means to maintain themselves, live
without employment,” are declared to be vagrants, and after con-
viction may be committed to the Alms-House for a term not exceed-
ing 6 months, or to the Bridewell for a term not exceeding 60 days.
   By the 3rd sec. of the act relative to the powers of the Common
Council of the City of New-York and the Police and Criminal Courts
of the said City, passed 1838, it is declared that “all common prosti-
tutes who have no lawful employment whereby to maintain them-
selves, are vagrants,” and may, upon conviction, be committed, if not
a notorious offender, and be a proper object for such relief to the
Alms-House of said City for a term not exceeding six months, or if
an improper person to be sent to the Alms-House, then such person
shall be committed for the like time to the Penitentiary of said City.
   It is obvious that the offence charged is made up partly of a charge
under one and partly under the other of these laws, and if it could
be allowed as contended for by the District Attorney to reject any
part of the description of the offence, (which I very much doubt,)
still there would be an insuperable difficulty in the way of supporting
this commitment. If we should reject the words, “and a common
prostitute,” the offence described would come within the description
of the act in the Revised Statutes above referred to; but as that
Statute prescribes a punishment of sixty days only in the Peniten-
tiary, and this commitment directs an imprisonment of six months—
the commitment is clearly void under that Statute. On the other hand,
if we should reject as surplusage the words “an idle person” and
“not having visible means to maintain herself” so that it would read
“a common prostitute who lives without employment” it is essential-
ly different from the words in the Statute of 1833, which are “a com-
mon prostitute <i>who has no lawful employment whereby to maintain
herself</i>.” Now a common prostitute who lives without employment,
but who <i>has</i> means to maintain herself, is clearly not within this
Statute, and therefore the description of the offence is uncertain and
does not correspond with the description of vagrancy in any Statute,
and the commitment is bad.
   3. The objection of the want of a seal is not well taken. The sta-
tute only requires that the commitment should be under the <i>hand</i> of
the magistrate, and the words “and seal” may be rejected as surplus-
age.
   It is not necessary in a <i>commitment</i> of this kind to state the evi-
dence of the facts in detail, or the names of the witnesses, although
it is indispensably necessary to be inserted in the record of convic-
tion. It is sufficient if the offence is described with certainty in the
commitment, and that the party has been convicted by a person hav-
ing authority for that purpose. 12 East. 69 82.
   There is one other objection which I consider fatal as to the va-
lidity of this commitment.
   If the prisoner was regularly convicted as a vagrant, the punishment
to be inflicted is in the alternative, if she is not a notorious offender,
&c. she is to be sent to the Alms-House, otherwise to the Penitentia-
ry. It is well settled that where imprisonment is inflicted by the
statute as an alternative punishment, or where there is a discretion to
commit either to one place at hard labor for a time not exceeding a
particular period, or to another place for the like time, the commit-
ment ought to notice that fact, 1 Lord Raymond, 545; Paley on con-
victions, 189. And in a case in 2d Burrow's Reports, 1165, the Court
lay down the rule emphatically that where the commitment is discre-
tionary as to length of time or as to place, there must be an adjudi-
cation by the magistrate as to the time and the place, and because
there was no adjudication on that point the conviction was quashed.
The Court said it was a conviction without a judgement. The time
and the duration of the commitment ought to be ascertained upon the
conviction. A conviction is equal to a verdict and judgement. But
this is a verdict without a judgement. The objection taken by the
Counsel for the prisoner on this ground is well taken.
   An examination of the proceedings in the Police Court in this
case, as well as some experience in other cases, has satisfied me that
an idea prevails that in the administration of justice in inferior tribu-
nals, and in cases of the lesser grades of crime, it is only necessary to
have in view the substantial end of justice, and that a regard to forms
is not essential. This I consider to be a radical error. The power of
a Justice to commit a person to prison upon conviction without the
intervention of a jury, is a power which ought to be exercised with
great caution and prudence; it is one which is liable to all the abuse
growing out of an ignorance of duty on the part of the Magistrate—
out of prejudice or personal dislike, or out of interested motives, and
is ought to be sedulously watched by requiring a strict adherence to
those forms of law which have been wisely provided to guard against
those abuses. This exception to the right of trial by jury is founded
only upon the necessity of the case, is intended rather to provide for
the wants or necessities of the Vagrant than as a punishment, and
uses punishment only so far as it is necessary to compel the idle and
dissipated to provide for their own maintenance. The forms of law
make it necessary that the Magistrate should enter in the Record of
Conviction the testimony and the names of the witnesses, so that it
may appear when the record should be submitted for review to the
tribunal which has power to control it, whether the offence proved is
within the jurisdiction of the Magistrate, and to provide the means
of holding the Magistrate responsible for the correct discharge of his
duty.
   We live in a country which has been remarkable for the respect
which is paid to the due and proper administration of justice; and so
long as the law is purely administered and magistrates conform to the
provisions of the law, and keep within the line of their duties, and
submit to the decisions made by the duly constituted authorities, a re-
liance on the virtue and good sense of the people induces the belief
that the same respect will continue to be paid; but if magistrates
choose to make rules for themselves, to depart from the rules settled
for their government, and to set up their own constructions of the
law in opposition to the law as legitimately declared and expounded,
it presents an example and forms an excuse to the depraved to set
the laws at defiance, and would lead to the most disastrous conse-
quences.
   The proper forms are to be found in books of established prece-
dents, and I have no doubts that, if the arduous duties of the District
Attorney will permit, he would cheerfully give such advice as would
enable the magistrates in the Police Office to adopt proper forms, and
enable them to perform their duties in a manner which will be free
from objection.
   The commitment in this case being void for the reasons I have sta-
ted, I order that the prisoner be discharged from custody thereon, and
direct the Keeper of the City Prison to discharge her accordingly.</m9>

<b>The Outrage on Mary C. Rogers, and similar
   Attacks in other places—A Public Meet-
   ing.</b>
   We copy the following account of an outrageous
attack on a Baltimore lady from a Philadelphia pa-
per:—
<m9>   “We are informed,” says the Baltimore Clipper, “by
the watchman of the neighborhood, that on Monday night
last a gentleman called upon him for aid under the follow-
ing circumstances:—The gentleman, accompanied by a
lady, was walking in the vicinity of the infirmary about
nine o'clock, when they were instantly surrounded by
eight or ten young men, some of whom beat him conside-
rably, whilst others forcibly bore the young lady off. He
hastened for the watchman, and on returning, neither the
lady nor the ruffians could be found.”
   “This,” adds the Clipper, “is the second outrage of the
kind that has been perpetrated in our city within a few
days and the <u title="villains">villians</u>, in both instances, have thus far es-
caped detection. From the lawless disposition which has
thus been exhibited, and the perfect impunity with which
crime is committed, it will become dangerous for ladies
to appear in our streets after dark, even when accompa-
nied by gentlemen.”</m9>
   Can this outrage throw any light on the murder of
Mary Rogers? A fortnight has now elapsed, since
the perpetration of one of the most daring and mur-
derous outrages ever perpetrated in a community call-
ing itself civilized. Yet we hear of no clue arrived at,
and but very little exertion made for the discovery
and punishment of the brutal ravishers and murder-
ers. The apathy of the people of this city, in some
cases, is most remarkable. If a great robbery, or a
bare-faced forgery is perpetrated, we find plenty of
people ready to pursue and capture the offender. If
a petty theft is effected, the indignation of the Court
of Sessions is aroused, and should it be a piece of
pork or some old clo', that are stolen, the poor, hun-
gry, half-starved mortal is brought up to the Special
Sessions, and sent to dig stone—but if a human be-
ing is suddenly and ruthlessly severed from the
thread of existence, we see the ministers of Justice
stand with their arms folded, waiting for a price to
be bid for their exertions ere they will start on the
trail of the murderers. Such a system offers an im-
punity to the rich ruffian, it holds a shield over the
<u>violater</u> of female virtue, and in but too many cases,
acts as the stimulant to outrages at which human-
ity shudders.
   It is in vain to call upon the ministers of justice to
step in and stay the plague which is at our doors,
and the community—at least the virtuous portion—
must act for themselves. Let a public meeting be
set a foot, a subscription raised in order to offer a
reward for the murderers of Mary Rogers. We will
give <small>FIFTY DOLLARS</small>; and we doubt not that in less
then 24 hours a thousand dollars may be raised, to be
paid into the hands of the Mayor of New York, for
the purpose of stimulating the energetic and <u title="indefatigable">inde-
fatigible</u> police of this—the commercial and intel-
lectual emporium of these United States.
   If this course is not pursued, no woman will be
safe, even under the protection of a husband or brother.
For other attacks have since come to our knowledge
and although the fellows did not in all the instances
succeed in their brutal object, or take the life of
their victim, still it is evident that nothing but fear
saved them from the guilt of a capital crime. At
Brooklyn, a married lady was seized by a gang
of ruffians and violated. On Coney Island Beach,
two sisters, while bathing were attacked by a
brawny rascal, and but for the nerve and courage dis-
played by the younger of the girls, the brute would
have accomplished his purpose. In Philadelphia
and Baltimore, similar outrages have been attempt-
ed, as will be seen by the extract attached to this
article. About ten days since, a young lady was
violated in the open day light in one of the public
parks of the latter city, in the presence of several
respectable citizens who were unable to save the
daughter of a neighbor from the loathsome contami-
nation of a herd of wretches who are a disgrace to
humanity.
   Let us, therefore, have a public meeting—a volun-
tary effort, to give dignity and force to the admin-
istration of justice. It is time—full time. Here are
our criminal judges making a great noise about petty
offenders—presenting in a breath all the “lower
classes”—but silently skipping over those dens of
assignation, frequented by the respectable classes—
and where it is probable that Mary Rogers was for-
cibly taken—forcibly violated—then murdered to
conceal the crime—and her body consigned to the
Hudson to bury the whole in the deep sea waves.
Yes, on every hand our criminal judges are assailing
the liberty of the press—and getting up indictments
on frivolous pretences, while the liberty, the life, the
virtue of an industrious and respectable young wo-
man, furnishes the staple of no charge to a Grand
Jury—does not excite the slightest attention in the
bosom of the tender-hearted Judge, that talks so
much of duty, character, virtue, and public order.
Out upon hypocrites in high places! Let the people
meet at once in the Park, and get up a subscription
that will make the officers of justice bestir them-
selves. Eight per cent. on the value of a human
life will surely call forth some Bill Wiley, as did the
like percentage in the case of Frederick County
Bank. Really—really, the newspapers are becom-
ing the only efficient police, the only efficient judges
that we have.

   ☞ H<small>OBOKEN FOR EVER</small>.—We have already asserted
that a trip to Hoboken is preferable to any other place,
because there is no need of walking two miles under a
scorching sun in order to find a resting place and a cool
retreat. Go, friends, to the steamboats at the foot of Bar-
clay, Canal, or Christopher streets, and after having
sailed across to beautiful Hoboken, in three minutes you
arrive at the pleasant, shaded Hoboken house, kept by

		[FOR THE SUN.]
   M<small>R</small>. E<small>DITOR</small>—I was at Hoboken the afternoon
that the murdered body of Miss Rodgers lay upon
the beach, and saw it before the jury of inquest
was held, and am surprised that these is so much
mystery about it, and that even the plain story
has never been laid before the public.
   Upon enquiring of a man who keeps an oyster
stand near the dock bridge, at the Elysian Fields,
he replied that the young lady went out in a small
boat, with a gentleman, his wife, and daughter,
the Sunday previous, and while out in the river
another small boat, with seven men in it, came
alongside, and took her into their boat by force;
and that he (the oysterman) and his child were on
the dock bridge in the evening, and with others
distinctly heard her cries, which the men in the
boat tried to drown by singing and carousing.—
The oysterman stated, also, that persons who
heard her cries wanted to go out to her rescue,
but there was not a small boat about that could be
got.
   Now, who is this gentleman with his wife and
daughter? And why is not this part of the story
published? (as I presume it was told to any others
who enquired.) And why is not a sufficient re-
ward offered for information that might lead to
the discovery of the murderers?
				A<small>NTI</small>-M<small>YSTERY</small>.
   We know not who is the writer of the foregoing,
and consequently cannot say to what degree of
credence it may be entitled. If true, its publica-
tion is all important; and we give it as it was giv-
en to us, in the hope that it may tend to draw the
facts of the fatal mystery to light—[E<small>DS</small>. S<small>UN</small>.<a id="Sun-1841-08-10-TDW"></a>
   ☞ Since the foregoing was in type, yester-
day's Evening Tattler appeared with a communi-
cation, and remarks by the Editor, from which it
appears that the two gentlemen spoken of by his
correspondent were a Mr. Fanshaw and a Mr.
Thomas—the former a brother, the latter a son-in-
law of Mr. Daniel Fanshaw; and that they fully
corroborate the statement of “T. D. W.,” which is
as follows:
T<small>O THE</small> E<small>DITORS OF THE</small> T<small>ATTLER</small>:
   Gentlemen,—If you consider what I am about
to communicate worth publishing it is at your ser-
vice. I have declined coming forward through mo-
tives of a, perhaps criminal, prudence and even
now I dare not reveal my name, because I fear
that by doing so I might become the victim of a
gang, who are all powerful to revenge any injury
that may be done to any members of their body—
such a gang, for instance, as went such lengths for
the release of Ezra White, from an apprehension
that if he came to the gallows he might implicate
many of themselves, in his “dying confessions.”
If you doubt the authenticity of my letter, or sup-
pose it to be a hoax, please keep possessions of it,
and advertise for the two gentlemen alluded to in
it, to come forward—who, if they are not also too
fearful of the gang to make themselves known—
will probably call on you and corroborate the fol-
lowing statement:
   On Sunday, the 25th of July, I was sauntering
towards evening on the banks at Hoboken. My
attention was suddenly arrested by a boat rushing
across the Hudson from New York, at great speed;
and when it neared the land, I perceived that there
were in the boat six men, and <i>one young well dress-
ed female</i>, whom I feel confident, from description,
as also from a dim recollection of my own, was
the Cigar Girl. Immediately as they touched the
strand, the six men and the female left the boat
and proceeded towards the woods. I then noticed
that the men were of that class denominated
“rowdies”—such men, for instance, as hang
about the doors of low gaming public houses, wear
flat-brimmed hats, and affect an air of vulgar de-
vil-may-care gentility. At this time I observed
two gentlemen conversing a short distance off.—
These gentlemen also noticed the boat, and I
think from their gestures, made some remarks
about the people that were in it.
   Be this as it may, two of the boatmen lingered
behind and spoke to these gentlemen, for the
purpose, probably, of diverting their attention
from the road the others with the female took;—
and then these two likewise proceeded at a sharp
pace for the woods. I cannot say that the female
made any opposition—I rather think she did not,
or I would have observed it—but at all events she
was there.
   Scarcely had this party passed out of sight, than
another boat came sweeping over the river. This
had three men in it, and when they landed, they
jumped from the boat with great rapidity, and
looked eagerly about them, as if in quest of some
object. The gentlemen I have alluded to before
being nearest these men, one of them asked him<!-- Some text is better visible in Herald-1841-08-12 & Rutland-Herald-1841-08-17 -->
if they had seen a female and several men landing
from a boat? The gentlemen replied in the affir-
mative. “Did you observe,” asked the same man,
“if they used any violence with her?” The <u>gen-
tlemen</u> answered “no.” And then the boatmen
being informed of the route the first party took,
followed at a rapid stride—almost a run.
   The above is all I know about the affair, but I
am firmly persuaded in my own mind, that the
young lady brought over in the first boat was the
“cigar girl” who was so brutally murdered a few
hours afterwards. I wonder the two gentlemen
have not made their experience in this matter
public, for I am sure that they must entertain the
same suspicions that I do. Yours, T. D. W.

   ☞ There is a circumstantial account in the last Evening
Tattler of a young woman being seen to land at Hoboken on
Sunday, July 25th, in company with five young men, while
three more young men landed from another boat soon after,
and inquired for the former party, and also if any <i>violence</i>
had been offered to the girl. They then followed the direc-
tion of the other party.—The inference which alone gives this
story any consequence is that the girl was <i>Mary C. Rogers</i>.
But we have made inquiries, and ascertained to our satisfac-
tion that the woman so seen was <i>not</i> Miss Rogers, but a com-
mon creature of the town, who had been taken out of the

vious to every one that no decent woman would have been so
conveyed unless by force, and certainly not without outcry
past several persons who would have aided her rescue.

   We have received a communication, signed
“Chirurgicus” on the subject of “the disgraceful
and unprofessional exhibitions at the Stuyvesant
Institute” and though we fully agree with every
observation of the writer, we cannot publish it
entire, many of his remarks having allusion to an
individual and to a press, so vile and base, that it
is with the utmost repugnance we bring ourselves to
notice either the one or the other. The exhibitions
themselves, our correspondent may rely, will become
objects of disgust not with the profession alone, but
with the whole community: and those who have got
them up, will soon be classed with the traveling
mountebanks, who infest with their booths the fairs
and market places of Europe, and exhibit to the gaping
multitude, the horrid spectacle of human nature suf-
fering under afflictions, which their wondrous skill
alone can cure. Were charity the aim, would it not
be better exercised in private? Were it to impart
surgical skill; is not the secluded room the proper
place, the student alone being spectator. Never be-
fore, that we know of, have regular bred physicians
or surgeons, sought to obtain notoriety, by tricks
which only come within the domain of the charlatan.
   We annex the concluding part of the communica-
tion as it is addressed to one who all respect and who
should not suffer his name and fame to be thus pros-
tituted.—[E<small>DITOR </small>C & E.
   The profession have seen with disgust, this man
[the Herald reporter] prominent among the most fa-
vored guests. He however, appears quite among his
friends, has his joke with one Professor, and grasps
another by the hand.—They assist him in taking
notes. All this degradation is submitted to—for
what? That the University may be lauded in the
same columns with <u>Madam</u> R<small>ESTELL</small>. Among these
Professors there is one of whom his brethren expect-
ed better things. Can it be that the associate of
H<small>OSACK</small>, and P<small>OST</small>, and McN<small>EVEN</small>, and M<small>ITCHELL</small>,
can consent to play hail-fellow-well-met, with such
a vagabond, and all to be puffed in <u>Madam</u> R<small>ESTELL</small>'s
organ? I know he seeks to excuse himself by say-
ing—“I had nothing to do with it!” “I know nothing
about it.” This excuse however, will not avail. He
is art and part, and will be so considered—without
his name the whole fabric of <i>quackery</i> would fall to
the ground. The profession look <i>to him</i>. Of his as-
sociates, as he well knows, they know little and care
less—but <i>to him</i> they look to elevate the standard of
professional character.
   Does he not feel that his fame must be tarnished
and his name soiled by being dragged through the
receptacle of filth and blackguardism, to which I
have alluded? Let him be assured, that if he does
not feel this, the profession do—and they will resent
it. Especially, will this be done by the junior por-
tion of the profession, whose proud aspirations in re-
gard to the future standing of the profession he is so
cruelly sacrificing.		CHIRURGICUS.

			POLICE—Monday.
	...
   One of the evening papers of yesterday mentions
the fact that two gentlemen, Messrs. Fanshaw and
Thomas, on the 25th ult. were witnesses to a circum-
stance which may possibly shed some light on the
deep mystery that now hangs round the fate of Mary
C. Rogers. It is there stated that on Sunday, the
25th, while at Hoboken, they saw a boat containing
six men and one female, all of whom as soon as they
landed at Hoboken, left the boat and started for the
woods. Soon afterwards another boat landed there,
rowed by three men, one of whom asked one of the
above named gentlemen if he had seen a boat with
the six men and a girl in it, and on receiving an affir-
mative reply, he asked if any violence had been of-
fered, to which he answered they had not. The
three last named men then started off apparently in
great haste in pursuit of the men with the young fe-
male.
   This may or may not be the unfortunate girl, whose
fate has created such deep excitement, but at all
events, it is to be hoped that the above statement
(taken from the Tattler,) may be traced out, and if
indeed it was the hapless Mary C. Rogers, there may
<s>be some hope that her murderers will be brought to</s>
justice. We have not heard of any steps taken by
the Police in the matter.

been found out definitely in relation to this murder;
which was even a far more horrible affair than the
murder of Miss Sands. As far as we know, there
has not even been a reward offered by the authorities
of this city or New Jersey. The whole thing—the
entire proceedings—commencing with the finding
of the body, the inquest, &c., in their manner, have
been most disgraceful. What are our criminal au-
thorities about? It really appears that since the pas-
sage of the new criminal court law, by which so
much milk and water and folly has been infused in-
to the bench, that the true administration of public
justice is shamefully neglected. The police judges
say that as fast as they act in certain cases for the
public good, some one or other of the other judges
of the criminal court undo all they have done; the
two branches of criminal justice are thus made to
war against each other, and in this way we suppose
murders and robberies and outrages of the most hor-
rible kind are perpetrated, and no one is punished or
even arrested therefor. How long is that sad state
of things to continue? How much has Gov. Sew-
ard to answer for, in thus disorganizing our criminal
court, which, when composed of Robert H. Morris,
two Aldermen, and James R. Whiting, was the
most honest and efficient criminal court in the coun-
try. We yet hope that the citizens will take this
matter up, and call a meeting in the Park or else-
where, and subscribe a reward for the detection of
the murderer of Mary Rogers. We do not believe
the story that she was taken out of a boat in the ri-
ver. We have heard that a female was taken out of
a boat on the river on that day or the day after, from
her own father, but that she was not Mary Rogers.
Dr. Cook says that almost every thing thrown into
the North River, near the Battery, floats over to Ho-
boken, and therefore thinks she was murdered in this
city and thrown into the river. We hardly think
this; and A. M. C. Smith says that one or two gen-
tlemen saw Mary Rogers sitting on a bench at Ho-
boken, late on Sunday afternoon, with a young man,
and that they were quarrelling severely. The whole
thing has been most miserably mismanaged. Let
us subscribe for a reward at once.

   T<small>HE</small> H<small>OBOKEN</small> M<small>URDER</small>.—Nothing has transpired at the
Police office worth detailing to our readers on this me-
lancholy subject, notwithstanding the many stories
which are daily dished up for those who like to sup full
of horrors. The young sailor, who was arrested last
week, <i>is staying in the Tombs</i>, at his own request. He says,
that he shall be looked upon as a suspected person if he
goes, as he might, on board the North Carolina, and that
he wishes to remain in custody until the authorities are
fully satisfied of his innocence. We believe that one of
the Magistrates was out all yesterday, in company with
an officer, and that they both returned without obtaining
any clue to the murderers. It is still the prevailing opin-
ion that the deed was effected in this city, and that the
parties immediately fled, leaving no trace of their where-
abouts; and when it is considered that three days elap-
sed before the body was found, and six before any excite-
ment was raised at the atrocity, we <u>thing</u> it is not surpri-
sing that no discovery has been made.

		<i>From the New-York Express</i>.
	AN ATROCIOUS MURDER.
   The murder of the unfortunate girl, Mary
<u>Cecelia</u> Rogers, noticed in another part of
our paper is of such an atrocious character
as to demand that it be taken forth from the
ordinary police Reports to be made a matter
of especial attention, in order, if possible to
arouse inquiry as to the murderers. This
girl has been seen by most persons who have
walked by the Cigar store of Anderson in
Broadway, where she was somewhat con-
spicuous as a vender of Cigars, whence she
obtained the <i>sobriquet</i> of “the Cigar girl.”
This girl was missed by her friends for
some days, who advertised for her at last in
the public prints, but on <u>Thursday</u> last, her
body was found in the water near Hoboken,
by some persons passing in a sail boat. The
discovery of the body bearing evident marks
of violence, aroused inquiry, and the Coro-
ner's Jury, while they bore testimony to her
general good character, also came to the
conclusion that she was murdered.
   Nothing as yet is certainly known of the
manner of her death. According to the New
Era, she was crossing the river to Hoboken
in a small boat with a young man who was
paying her honorable attention, and that hav-
ing proceeded half way over, another boat
in which were 5 complete rowdies and soap-
locks came alongside, and who forced her
into the boat and pushed off, up the river,
and when an opportunity presented, and they
were concealed, as they imagined from ob-
servation, violated her person and afterwards
to prevent their infamous and diabolical acts
from coming to light, threw the unfortunate
victim of their nefarious and unruly passions
overboard.
   The Courier well remarks, it seems in-
credible that men could deliberately plan
and commit a murder for such a motive, yet
the facts inevitably lead to the conclusion,
that this is one of those unnatural instances
of horrid crime, which sets all reason at de-
fiance. Ten days have now elapsed since
its commission; hitherto the tracks of its fe-
rocious perpetrators have not been discover-
ed, and the blood of the hapless female will
probably pass unrevenged, unless the public
authorities evince more than ordinary activ-
ity.

		MARY C. ROGERS
   The murder of this young and beautiful girl, con-
nected as is supposed with the brutal violation of her
person, has created great excitement in the city of New
York.
   This girl was missed by her friends for some days,
who advertised for her at last in the public prints, but
on <u>Thursday</u> last, her body was found in the water near
Hoboken, by some persons passing in a sail boat. The
discovery of the body bearing evident marks of vio-
lence, aroused inquiry, and the Coroner's Jury, while
they bore testimony to her general good character, al-
so came to the conclusion that she had been robbed of
her chastity, and then murdered to conceal the crime.
The examination of persons suspected has as yet elic-
ited nothing that will reveal the mystery of her death.

   T<small>HE</small> M<small>URDER OF</small> M<small>ARY</small> C. R<small>OGERS</small>.—Is there to
be no extraordinary incentive offered to stimulate to
the discovery of the authors of this atrocious crime?
Do the authorities of the city where she belonged,
and whence she was probably decoyed, feel no obli-
gation to offer a reward for the detection of the ruf-
fian murderers? Should not the State Executive
issue his proclamation of reward, and pardon, if ne-
cessary, to any accomplice that shall convict the real
criminal?
   We have seen something of these authorities wait-
ing for the action of New Jersey. But why so? It
may well be that the Governor of New Jersey
hesitates about staining the annals of his State with
a proclamation implying that a crime so atrocious
was perpetrated by its citizens or within its borders.
But whether or not she was from New York, the
body was found within the jurisdiction of New York,
which extends for purposes of police and legal service
to low water mark on the Jersey shore, and, more-
over, the more probable conjecture, it seems to us,
is, that this unfortunate victim of unbridled lust was
decoyed into a boat, and that there, on the broad
Hudson, and out of the reach of succor, the crime
was perpetrated, and the body loaded with stones,
thrown over to be sunk, as the murderers (for there
must have been more than one) probably hoped, for-
ever, from the reach of human eye.
   We call, therefore, upon the Common Council—
we call upon the Executive of the State, to be stir-
ring in this bloody business, which cries to Heaven
for vengeance.

England, since the last peace, has become overrun

there are to be picked up easily enough, but, on enquiry,
they are all found to be like the baseless fabric of

Several anonymous letters have been received, all
written in a very neat female hand, pointing out a
young gentleman well known as a sort of genteel
loafer at the theatres, and a frequenter of gambling hou-
ses and other places of public resort, as having been seen
with Mary sitting on a rock—on the other side of the
North River on the fatal Sunday afternoon. We do not
think these letters likely to lead to any discovery, for
the person whom they point at has been guilty of pursu-
ing his usual avocations down town ever since. They
are most likely written by some fair intrigante whom
the party has piqued or made jealous. The Police have
their eye, of course, on the individual, and if he were to
leave the city suddenly he might find himself—in cus-
tody.

	<b>The Late Murder of Mary C. Rogers.</b>
   The supineness of the authorities in relation to
the late brutal murder, has induced several of the
citizens to take the necessary steps to offer a reward
for the detection of the murderers. We theretofore
call attention to the following:—
<m9>				N<small>EW</small> Y<small>ORK</small>, Aug. 10, 1841.
   The undersigned, having seen no public measures ta-
ken by the authorities of New York City, or the State of
New Jersey, to detect the murderers of Mary C. Rogers,
and deeming this matter to be one of the utmost mo-
ment to every parent, husband, and brother, in this com-
munity, do hereby call a primary meeting of their fellow
citizens, to be held at the house of James C. Stoneall, 29
Ann street, on Wednesday, the 11th day of August, 1841,
at eight o'clock in the evening, for the purpose of adopt-
ing such preparatory measures as may be deemed ne-
cessary to bring the perpetrators of the murder to speedy
punishment.

   We have very little to say in addition to the above.
The call of this meeting has been got up in a hurry,
because the nature of the case seemed to require
speedy action. Mr. Aaron Clark has been waited
upon in connection with this matter, and the follow-
ing are his remarks in relation thereto. Mr. Clark
will, however, subscribe to a reward:
<m9>   I am clearly of opinion that the murder of Mary C. Ro-
gers justifies and requires that a suitable reward should
be offered by the proper authority in this city for the ap-
prehension of the perpetrators.		AARON CLARK.

   We have only to add a request that all our fel-
low citizens, who can do so, <i> will attend the meeting
at Mr. Stoneall's,</i> 29 <i>Ann st. to-night!</i> We will give
$50 ourselves towards convicting the murderers;
and, already, with the above names, there are $200
subscribed for this purpose. We call upon Mayor
Morris to move in this matter. What is Governor
Seward doing?

   ☞ There is a foul compound of falsehood and malice in yester-
day's Sun, intended to defame this paper, but which bears on its face
the evidence of <i>conscious</i> <u>villany</u>. If any person has really paid for
the insertion of an advertisement in The Sun and fount it published
<u>  </u> this paper instead, <i>give us his name</i>. We ask it—we demand it:
if there be any such man, his name can easily be given. We never
heard of the like, and are confident that no such error or fraud has
ever occured.
   It is true that, our paper being recently established and our office
not in the most public location, we have through Agents solicited the
patronage of our friends, both as subscribers and advertisers, and
their response has been most cordial and cheering. We have at this
moment twice as much patronage of all kinds as The Sun had when
no older than The Tribune now is, and we give twice as much read-
ing matter. As to the relative value of the two papers as an adver-
tising medium, very much depends upon the matter advertised. For
Madame Restell's surgery, 'Hunter's Red Drop,' &c. The Sun is
doubtless the best medium extant, and we cheerfully allow it the field.
But we have the assurance of many who have tried the experiment
that for Books, Fashionable Dry Goods, Boarding, &c. &c. The Tri-
bune is very far superior. One gentleman lately informed us casu-
ally that he recently advertised some property three times in The
Sun and had not a single call for it. A week after, he advertised it in
the Tribune, and had a dozen calls forthwith. This is but one case
of several. That The Sun <i>feels</i> this in the diminution of its Adver-
tising, any man can see who will take the trouble to compare its
columns now with a file of the same paper six months ago. Hence
this malignant attack upon us.<f>

uty sheriff, who conducts the convicts from this city to Sing
Sing prison, informs us that 16 prisoners were discharged
from that prison by expiration of sentence during the month
of July. On the 1st of August inst. there remained in prison
at Sing Sing 752 males and 67 females; total 819. This is a
less number than there has been in the Sing Sing prison
at any period for the last seven years.

   A T<small>ALE OF</small> H<small>ORROR</small>.—<i>Three Children murdered by their

distressing and revolting infanticide that has ever come within
our knowledge, from the Louisville (Miss.) Tablet of the <u title="'29' in Mohawk Courier, '24' in Herald">24th</u>
ult.:
   “One on the most awful deeds that has perhaps ever come
within the knowledge of the human race was perpetrated in
the vicinity of this place on Sunday morning last, by a Mrs.
Roper. <i>She killed three of her own children by cutting
their heads off with an axe</i>. From the information which
we have received on the subject, it seems to have been done
while she was in a fit of mental derangement. It was her
intention to have killed two more in the same manner, and
afterwards hang herself with a hank of yarn, but her husband
waking up, discovered something extraordinary in her actions
and seized her around the waist. After a strong effort on her
part to escape from him, during which she tried to draw one
of three knives from the ceiling, which she had previously
sharpened and put there, they reached the door, when he dis-
covered what she had been doing.
   “She is the mother of eleven children, including the three
which she killed. She appears now to be restored to reason,
and is pitiable spectacle of the deepest and most bitter an-
guish. She says that while under the influence of a distorted
imagination, she thought she was doing a charitable action in
ridding her husband of the burthen of supporting herself and
their five youngest children, as he is a poor and very hard-
working man.”</f>

FURTHER PARTICULARS—PROBABLE TRACE
		OF THE MURDERERS.
	N<small>EW</small> Y<small>ORK</small>, Saturday, Aug. 7, 1841.
To the Editors of the Tattler:
   G<small>ENTLEMEN</small>.—If you consider what I am about
to communicate worth publishing, it is at your
service. I have declined coming forward through
motives of a, perhaps criminal, prudence, and even
now I dare not reveal my name, because I fear
that by doing so I might become the victim of a
gang, who are all powerful to revenge any injury
that may be done to any members of their body—
such a gang, for instance, as went such lengths for
the release of Ezra White, from an apprehension
that if he came to the gallows he might implicate
many of themselves, in his “dying confessions.”—
If you doubt the authenticity of my letter, or sup-
pose it to be a hoax, please keep possessions of it,
and advertise for the two gentlemen alluded to in
it, to come forward—who, if they are not also too
fearful of the gang to make themselves known—
will probably call on you and corroborate the fol-
lowing statement:
   On Sunday, the 25th of July, I was sauntering
towards evening on the banks at Hoboken. My
attention was suddenly arrested by a boat rushing
across the Hudson, from New York, at great speed;
and when it neared the land, I perceived that there
were in the boat six men, and <i>one young well dres-
sed female</i>, whom I feel confident, from description,
as also from a dim recollection of my own, was the
C<small>IGAR</small> G<small>IRL</small>. Immediately as they touched the
strand, the six men and the female left the boat
and proceeded towards the woods. I then noticed
that the men were of that class denominated “row-
dies”—such men for instance as hang about the
doors of low gaming public houses, wear flat-brim-
med hats, and affect an air of vulgar devil may-
care gentility. At this time I observed two gentle-
men conversing a short distance off. These gentle-
men also noticed the boat, and I think from their
gestures, made some remarks about the people
that were in it.
   Be this as it may, two of the boatmen lingered
behind, and spoke to these gentlemen, for the pur-
pose, probably, of diverting their attention from
the road the others with the female took; and then
these two likewise proceeded at a sharp pace for
the woods. I cannot say that the female made any
opposition—I rather think she did not, or I would
have observed it—but at all events, she was there.
   Scarcely had this party passed out of sight, than
another boat came sweeping over the river. This
had three men in it, and when they landed, they
jumped from the boat with great rapidity, and look-
ed eagerly about them as if in quest of some ob-
ject. The gentlemen I have alluded to before be-
ing nearest these men, one of them asked him if
they had seen a female and several men landing
from a boat? The gentlemen replied in the affir-
mative. “Did you observe,” asked the same man,
“<small>IF THEY USED ANY VIOLENCE WITH HER</small>?” The
gentleman answered “No.” And then the boat-
men, being informed of the route the first party
took, followed at a rapid stride—almost a run.
   The above is all I know about the affair, but I am
firmly persuaded in my own mind, that the young
lady brought over in the first boat was the <i>cigar
girl</i> who was so brutally murdered a few hours af-
terwards. I wonder the two gentlemen have not
made their experience in this matter public—for I
am sure that they must entertain the same suspi-
cions that I do.		Yours,		T. D. W.

	REMARKS—FURTHER PARTICULARS.
   When we first received the foregoing commu-
nication we gave but little credence to the state-
ments contained in it. On reflection however, not
being able to see that the writer could have any ob-
ject in hoaxing us, we put all the force in our office
on the trail to see if we could not hunt up the “two
gentlemen.” All the evening of Saturday, how-
ever, they were unsuccessful—(or we should have
furnished the particulars to the Sunday papers, as
such important facts cannot be too early known or
widely <u title="disseminated">dissseminated</u>)—but this morning, when
we had almost come to the conclusion to throw the
letter by as an invention, we not only discovered
the fact that two gentlemen had seen the events de-
scribed by our informer, but had also the satisfac-
tion of learning their names. They are, Mr. Fan-
shaw—brother, we believe, of Mr. Daniel Fanshaw,
printer to the Bible Society—and his son-in-law,
Mr. Thomas, who is agent for Dr. Peters, the pro-
prietor of the celebrated Vegetable Pill. These
two gentlemen, we are informed, fully corroborate
the testimony furnished us by our correspondent,
and are likewise impressed with the idea that the
female they saw in the boat, and the “murdered ci-
gar girl,” may be one and the same person.
   Our hurry and anxiety to place these important
particulars before the public, left us no time to go
to quest of Mr. Fanshaw, or Mr. Thomas; but we
shall be much obliged to them if they will commu-
nicate with us on the subject, and correct us if we
have made any mistake.
   If the female and the boatmen spoken of above,
were the cigar girl and her murderers, which we
think more than probable, that diabolical affair will
soon come to light, as six or seven men cannot keep
so dreadful a secret. Some one will surely turn
evidence against the others. At all events, these
disclosures will give the police authorities a clue,
and we trust they may profit by it.

<d>[Col.2. A changed copy from <a href="#Courier-1841-08-05">Courier</a>]</d>
   <i>The Case of Mary C. Rogers</i>.—Notwith-
standing the vigorous efforts of the authori-
ties here and in New Jersey, we regret to
state that no clue has as yet been discovered
to the perpetrators of this dreadful tragedy.
The two young men who were arrested here
have been examined, and nothing being eli-
cited to warrant their detention, they were
discharged. Justice Merritt, of Hoboken,
caused a young man in Jersey City to be
arrested on suspicion, but after a protracted
examination he was discharged on Tuesday
night.
   Justice Merritt has addressed a letter to
Governor Pennington, of New Jersey, and
there is no doubt that he will offer a suitable
reward for the detection of the murderers.
Our Mayor is only waiting the action of Gov.
Pennington in the premises, as he conceives
that the first offer of a reward should come
from him.
   In a conversation with Dr. Cook, of Ho-
boken, we learned that the body of the un-
fortunate girl showed evident marks that the
most brutal violence had been restored to,
one of her wrists having been clasped so
tightly as to leave a mark as of a rope.—
There were besides other marks and bruises,
showing that the poor girl had fallen into the
hands of some worse than brutes. It is now
generally supposed that the deceased was
thrown from the cliff near the Sybil's Cave,
and that the marks on her face were not
made by fists, as was at first supposed, but
by coming in contact with the rocks in her
fall.
   Since writing the above, officers have ar-
rested a young man (whose name it is not
necessary to mention) on suspicion of being
concerned in the murder. He was examin-
ed, but immediately sent on board the U. S.
ship North Carolina, on board which ship he
enlisted the day the body was found, there
being no evidence to warrant his detention.

   Alfred <u>Cromeline</u> duly sworn, saith that he
recognises the deceased, and was well ac-

C. Rogers, a resident of No. 126, Nassau
street, New York—that he has known her for
a considerable time—having boarded in her

ceased was the officiating manager of the

conducting the boarding house.

   <i>The Murder of Mary C. Rogers</i>.—This
shocking affair has produced a great sensa-
tion in this city. Every one is enquiring how
it can be that a girl so well known as Mary
was, should have been conveyed to Hoboken
and murdered, and none have seen her.——
There is no doubt that several persons have
been concerned, and the impunity which
seems to attend the act, has stricken terror
into the inhabitants.
   What is the police doing—are they on the <i>qui
vive</i>, or are they waiting for the reward? If
any thing will convince the citizens of
the immediate necessity of a day police and
a new organization of the whole police es-
tablishment, the escape of the boy murderer,
and the murder of Mary Rogers, taken from
the very centre of our city, ought to con-
vince them. The police should be under the
direction of the best talent in the city. The
present plan is all wrong.

Mr. Daniel C. Payne, of 47 John-street, the young man to
whom the unfortunate Miss Rogers was engaged in mar-
riage, went to the Police Office, at the request of Justice Par-
ker, to state what information he might possess calculated to
throw light upon the mysterious disappearance and murder
of Miss R. The examination, which was long and tedious,
elicited nothing which is likely to lead to the detection of the
murderers. He states that on Sunday morning, about 10
o'clock, she called at his room and stated that she was going
to her cousin's, Mrs. Downing's, and should return in the
evening. She then left, apparently cheerful and lively as
usual. He did not go to see her in the evening, as it rained,
and the next morning her family was alarmed, and he went
in search of her, but found no tidings or trace of her till her
lifeless remains were discovered in the Hudson on the Wed-
nesday following.
   By order of the Acting Mayor, Purdy, her body was yes-
terday disinterred, in order that the deceased might be more
fully identified by some of the witnesses; but decomposition
had already taken place, and no trace of the once 'beautiful
cigar girl' could be recognized in the blackened and swollen
features.
   There is one point in Mr. Payne's testimony which is wor-
thy of remark. It seems he had been searching for Miss
Rogers—his betrothed—two or three days; yet when he was
informed on Wednesday evening that her body had been
found at Hoboken, he did not go to see it or inquire into the
matter—in fact, it appears that he never went at all, though
he had been there inquiring for her before. This is odd,
and should have been explained.

		<b>The Hoboken Murder.</b>
   In spite of the intensity of the public feeling on
this awful outrage, nothing but conjecture is known
of the perpetration, or even of the bloody <i>locale</i> of the
deed. An Evening paper has published the follow-
ing communication:—
<m9>		N<small>EW</small> Y<small>ORK</small>, Saturday, Aug. 7th, 1841.
   G<small>ENTLEMEN</small>:—If you consider what I am about to com-
	...
   On Sunday, the 25th of July, I was sauntering toward
evening on the banks at Hoboken. My attention was
suddenly arrested by a boat rushing across the Hudson
from New York, at great speed; and when it neared the
land, I perceived that there were in the boat six men,
and <i>one young well-dressed female</i>, who I feel confident,
from description, as also from a dim recollection of my
own, was the <u>Segar</u> Girl. Immediately as they touched
the strand, the six men and the female left the boat, and
proceeded towards the woods. I then noticed that the
men were of that class denominated “rowdies”—such
	...
as if in quest of some object. The gentlemen I have allu-
ded to before, being nearest these men, one of them asked
him if they had seen a female and several men landing
from a boat? The gentlemen replied in the affirmative.
“Did you observe,” asked the same man, “if they used
any violence with her?” The <u>gentleman</u> answered “no.”
And then the boatmen being informed of the route the
first party took, followed at a rapid stride—almost
a run.
   The above is all I know about this affair, but I am firm-
ly persuaded in my own mind, that the young lady brought
over in the first boat was the <i>cigar girl</i> who was so bru-
tally murdered a few hours afterwards. I wonder the
two gentlemen have not made their experience in this
matter public—for I am sure that they must entertain the
same suspicions that I do.</m9>
   On this thin affair a morning paper speculates as
follows:—
<m9>   The two gentlemen alluded to in the above, are Wm. D.
Fanshaw, (nephew of Daniel Fanshaw,) and his brother-in-
law, Mr. Thomas. We have called on Mr. Fanshaw to
ascertain the correctness of the statements in the letter,
and he informs us that they are correct in every particu-
lar.</m9>
   There must be some mistake in this statement.
On the Sunday evening in question, there was a vio-
lent thunderstorm, which began before sundown, and
did not clear away till 10 o'clock, P.M. Just before
the storm many left Hoboken for the city. Two gen-
tlemen residing in Hoboken, happened to have been
at the Elysian Fields when the storm began. They
remained till 10 o'clock, when it had cleared up, and
then returned to the village by the sea shore. It was
then clear. They saw no person or boat—heard
none—every thing was quiet. Again, Mary Rogers'
face was well known to all “young men about
town” from her having been in Anderson's store. If
she had been at Hoboken on that day, she would
have been seen by dozens of persons that would have
recognised her.
   The theory, theretofore, that she was carried to
Hoboken and murdered there, is not founded on the
facts of the case. All the known circumstances re-
but such an idea. In this view of the case, another
paper has the following:—
<m9>   Under the present excitement, produced by the mys-
terious outrage committed upon the person of Miss Mary
Rogers, I take the liberty of submitting the following
remarks for your consideration, as from the nature of
the case they have suggested themselves to me.
   It is now a matter of general supposition, that the out-
rage was perpetrated at Hoboken, from the fact of the
body being found in its immediate vicinity, and the vic-
tim having been there during the day upon which it is
conjectured the murder was committed. These opinions,
in connection with the various statements in relation to
the tragedy, tend in a great measure to fix upon Hoboken
as the scene of the bloody affair, but when we take into
consideration the following facts, together with the lo-
cation of the body when found, it serves in my opinion to
lessen the probability of the act having been committed
at the above named place, and fixes an almost equal
amount of suspicion on our city.
   It is well known, that at the time the body was first dis-
covered, there was, and had been a prevalence of north
and north-easterly winds for almost a week previous.
In all such cases a very powerful current is produced,
tending down the river, strikes Glass House Point, and
so sets across with great power, to the exact neighbor-
hood in which the body was found, so that any floating
substance, under such circumstances, would naturally
find its way to the Hoboken shore, and there remain
fixed, until a change of wind, and its consequent current,
should carry it elsewhere. Now then had the murder,
as alleged, been committed at Hoboken, the body could
not possibly have <i>left</i> the shore such a distance, while
so strong a current was setting in against it, and conse-
quently would have been discovered at a much earlier
period.
   For proof of the foregoing argument, it is only neces-
sary to point you to the numerous instances in which de-
composed substances thrown from the docks in the up-
per part of the city, are found lying upon the opposite
shores; and such is the difficulty to remove them, that it
is necessary to tow them out a considerable distance
into the stream, to keep them from the influence of this
current, and give them an opportunity to pass down to
the lower bay, and yet the body of the murdered girl
was found some two or three hundred yards <i>from</i> the
shore.
   With this view of the case, there is (in my opinion) as
great a probability of the murder having been commit-
ted in our city as elsewhere, and there should the pur-
suits of justice be directed, for some trace of the spot
where the tragedy was enacted.			E.</m9>
   This is the most rational conjecture, and is corro-
borated by residents at Hoboken, who state a great
many facts, showing the cause of the current. Doc-
tor Cook, of Hoboken, thinks that a body thrown
into the river near Castle Garden, would float to-
wards Castle Point, near the place where Mary's body
was found.
   Every fact tends to confirm the conjecture that
Mary Rogers <i>was violated and murdered in this city—
and if so, how? when?—by whom?</i> Was it not per-
petrated in some of the hundred assignation houses
which are permitted to exist by our grave adminis-
trators of criminal police? Ought not every one of
these dens to be searched at once, for traces of vio-
lence, murder and blood? More then one person
had been engaged in this horrid crime—it cannot hide
itself forever. The murder will out, but proper
means must be adopted to help it out.
		<small>FURTHER PARTICULARS</small>.
   The following, from our Reporter, throws but
little light on the fate of the poor girl. It shows,
however, that the Police are not idle:—
<m9>   T<small>HE</small> M<small>ARY</small> R<small>OGERS</small> M<small>YSTERY</small>.—Yesterday afternoon,
the body of the unfortunate girl found on the shores of
Hoboken, and supposed to be that of Mary Rogers, was
disinterred for the purpose of identification. It was
brought over under an order issued by Elijah F. Purdy,
Acting Mayor, and placed in the Dead House. Of course,
it is one mass of decomposition, and cannot be identified
except by the clothes.
   The following statement was made by a man who ap-
pears to have been a sort of a lover of the unfortunate
girl.
   A man of the name of Daniel Payne came to the Police
Office at the request of the magistrate, and voluntarily
made a long statement, under oath, from which we have
condensed the following facts:—
   Daniel Payne had been a boarder in the house of Mrs.
Rogers since last October or November, and been so in-
timate with Mary, that they were engaged to have been
married. On the Sunday of her disappearance, Mary
knocked at the bedroom door of Payne, about 10 o'clock,
as he was making his toilet, and told him that “she was
going to Mrs. <u>Downings</u>,” and he replied, “very well,
Mary, I shall look out for you in the evening.” She then
appeared well and cheerful, and Payne has not seen her
since.
   Payne states that he went out about 11 o'clock that
Sunday, and went straight to his brother's in Warren
street, and remained in his company until 1 P. M. Part
of these two hours were spent in the house and part at
Scott's Bazaar, Dey street. After one o'clock Payne
walked up Broadway and thence to Bickford's in James
street, and read the papers until 2 o'clock—then to Ful-
ton street and dined at an eating house. About 3 P.M.
Payne went home and lay down till 6 o'clock, when he
walked to the Battery. As he left he says he met his
brother with his children, spoke to them at the gate and
parted. On reaching Ann street, Payne saw the storm
gathering, and walked to Bickford's in James street,
staid until 9 o'clock, and retired for the night.
   Payne says he thought the <u>omnibusses</u> run on Sunday,
and should have waited for Mary had the night been
clear. Payne says he never knew of Mary keeping com-
pany with any person but himself, nor of any male per-
son calling on her casually. Her habits were domestic,
and she was not in the habit of leaving the house except
to visit her relations.
   On Sunday evening about 9 o'clock, Mrs. Hayes, aunt
of Mary, said to Payne, “it is surprising that she, Mary,
has not returned home,” but added that her mother had
concluded, that she was prevented by the storm, and had
staid with Mrs. Downing all night. Nothing further
transpired that night.</m9>
<d>[Col.3]</d>
<m9>   The next morning at breakfast, Mary's mother said
that Mrs. Hayes had gone home to her house to see if
Mary was there. She returned and told she was not
there. Nothing more transpired until dinner, when
Payne says he heard for the first time that Mary had not
been heard of either at Mrs. Downing's or at Mrs. Hayes.
He then commenced a search for her himself. First
went to a Mrs. Pitcher's, at Harlem, and ascertained she
had not been there—next went to Williamsburg, without
success, and next visited Hoboken, Staten Island, and
the South Ferry without getting any tidings. On Tues-
day put an advertisement in the paper and called
on the keeper of a public house at the corner of
Duane and William streets. Went there in consequence
of a note having been received, stating that a girl had
been to <u>Collins'</u>, with a man, on Sunday afternoon, and
staid there three hours. This proved not to answer
the description of Mary, and Payne went again to Hobo-
ken, and made more particular inquiries—asked several
people at the ferry house, and at three different places
near the landing, and went along the shore to the Ely-
sian Fields, but without success. He returned to the
city, and shortly after heard from Mr. <u title="Luther">Luthur</u>, of No. 90
Chambers street, that Mary's body had been found at
Hoboken, and an inquest was to be held. Mr. Payne did
not go to Hoboken, in consequence of this information,
but a Mr. <u>Cromelin</u> did, and he said it was the body of
Mary, that the inquest was held, and the body buried.
   After this, it would appear that no further inquiries
were made until the press took the matter in hand. Of
course Mr. Payne was not detained, as no suspicion
rests on him.</m9>

<b id="Herald-1841-08-12-PM">Public Meeting in Relation to the Late
			Murder</b>.
   A numerous and highly respectable meeting was
held last night, at the house of James C. Stoneall, 29
Ann street, in relation to the above horrible affair.
   Upon motion of William H. Attree, the meeting
was called to order, by the appointment of Roder-
ick N. Morrison to the chair; Thomas Bell, Vice
President, and Richard Adams Locke and Hugh
Pattinson, as secretaries.
   W. H. Attree then offered the following preamble
and resolutions, which were unanimously adopted:—
   At a preliminary meeting held at the house of James
C. Stoneall, 29 Ann street, on the 11th day of August,
1841, to take measures for procuring the arrest and con-
viction of any or all those concerned in the above mur-
der, the following preamble and resolutions were adop-
ted:—
   Whereas, the members of this meeting view with
alarm and horror the circumstances connected with the
shocking murder of Mary C. Rogers. They also recol-
lect, with deep regret, that within the last few years
several murders has been committed in this city and
neighborhood, for the perpetration of which no one has
been brought to punishment. And without desiring to
cast unnecessary censure upon any of the authorities,
they deprecate the apparent apathy that has character-
ized the Chief Magistrates of the States of New Jersey
and New York, and the authorities of the county of
New York, in not offering a reward for the arrest of any
or all those concerned in the late murder—and believing
that in the present inefficiently organized state of our
Police Department, that little will be done towards de-
tecting the authors or perpetrators of this awful crime,
without a reward:
   Be it theretofore,
   Resolved, That a Committee of Twenty be appointed
by this meeting, to collect subscriptions for a reward to
be placed in the hands of a Treasurer to be appointed in
like manner, the reward to be paid on the apprehension
and conviction of any one of the murderers, with power
to add to their numbers.
   Resolved, That the same committee be called a “Com-
mittee of Safety,” with power to act in aid of the public
authorities, and to take such measures as they shall
deem proper (not conflicting with the foregoing reso-
lution) to effect the detection of the murderer or mur-
derers.
   Resolved, That we earnestly request our fellow citi-
zens to convene in their respective wards, and orga-
nize as they shall deem proper, to co-operate with the
aforesaid Committee in carrying out the object of this
meeting.
   Resolved, That the thanks of this meeting be given to
the public press of this city, for having repeatedly called
public attention to this horrible case; and that all the
editors be requested again to aid the Committee in pub-
lishing these proceedings.
   Upon motion of W. H. Attree, Mr. James C. Stone-
all was appointed the Treasurer.
   The following gentlemen were then appointed:—
				C<small>OMMITTEE</small>.
	Caleb S. Woodhull,		James Nesbitt,
	Revo C. Hance,			William H. Attree,
	William Thompson,		J. C. <u>Stonehall</u>,
	Thomas Bell,			R. <u>H</u>. Morrison,
	Robert <u title="Sinclair">Sinclain</u>,			Mr. Barton,
	Robt. Elton,			Vair Clirehugh,
	Hugh Pattinson,			Amos Leeds,
	William C. Carl,			John Lomas,
	Dudley Pearce,			Aaron Clark,
	E. R. Yale,				Charles H. Lovejoy,
	Daniel D. Howard,		John Cleveland,
	Leonard <u>T. Snithen</u>,		E. <u>G</u>. Paige.

   Mr. Attree then stated, that within the last few
hours he had personally waited upon the following
gentlemen, who had severally agreed to pay the
sums placed opposite to their respective names, upon
the arrest and conviction of any one of the murder-
ers, independent of any reward that might be offer-
ed by the authorities of either State or <u title="county">coanty</u>.
   The reading of this list was received with loud
cheers.

diately proffered Joseph Tucker and Robert Smith,
Esquires, ex-Aldermen of the city, as sureties that
he would appear at the next term of the Sessions,
and these gentlemen having all bound themselves,
severally and individually, in $10,000 each, the Jus-

up the young lady, who was taken out of a boat on the

<d>[Col.3]</d>
   <i>The case of Mary C. Rogers</i>.—Perhaps not the
least extraordinary feature of this horrid outrage is
the fact, that notwithstanding the most strenuous
efforts on the part of our authorities, not one trace of
the unfortunate girl has ever been discovered after
the door of her mother's house closed upon her forever.
Even up to this moment it is not fully known that
the body of the girl found at Hoboken is that of Miss
Rogers, that having been identified only by Mr. A.
Crommelin, who had boarded with her mother some
six months.
   Yesterday Mr. Daniel Payne voluntarily came to
the Police office, for the purpose of being examined
and of shedding, if possible, some light upon the
darkness that now envelopes her fate. He states
that he had known Mary since October or Novem-
ber last, during which time, up to the past few days
he had boarded with her mother at 126 Nassau street.
That the acquaintance with her soon grew into a
warmer feeling, and they had been engaged to be
married some time previous to her final and myster-
ious disappearance.
   On the morning of Sunday the 25th July, about
10 o'clock, while he was in his room shaving, she
came up stairs and knocked at his door. He opened
it and found her dressed for a walk, and she said she
was going to see Mrs. Downing, an acquaintance, re-
siding at No. 68 <u>James</u> street. He said very well, he
would come for her in the evening—she then appear-
ed as happy and cheerful as usual, and started off and
form that moment, all trace of her has been lost.
   Mr. Payne stated that she had been up to Mrs.
Downing's two or three times, upon which occasions
he would go in the evening to the corner of Broad-
way and Ann streets and watch for her in the <u>Omni-
buss</u>. Upon this occasion he did no go to seek for
her, as a violent storm sprang up, and he felt sure
that she would not attempt to leave Mrs. D.'s that
night.
   The witness then went on and gave a very detail-
ed and circumstantial account of the manner in
which he had passed that Sunday, after parting with
Mary at the door of his room. In the early part of
that evening, while he was up in his room, Mrs.
Hayes, an aunt of Mary's, came up to enquire about
her, saying that Mrs. R. was very uneasy; but he
told her where she had gone, and that from the na-
ture of the weather he did not expect her home that
night.
   The next morning while at work in his shop, he
first heard the intelligence that she had not been
either to Mrs. <u>Downings</u> or to Mrs. Hayes. He
then set to work to discover her if possible, and
went to every place in and out of the city, where
there was any possibility of hearing of her. He went
to Hoboken, to Harlem, to Staten Island, Williams-
burgh, and in fact every where, and he caused ad-
vertisements to be inserted in the papers, noticing
her disappearance. Nothing, however, has to this
moment been heard, tending to throw any light
upon her dreadful end.
   It will be seen that the testimony of Mr. Payne is
unimportant, except as far as it discloses her inten-
tions of visiting a friend on the fatal Sunday.
   The body of the unfortunate girl was brought to
this city yesterday afternoon, upon requisition of the
authorities here, and the shell enclosing it was open-
ed, in order that Mr. Payne or any others might have
an opportunity of identifying her. The body how-
ever was so much decomposed, that recognition of
the features was impossible; but Mr. Payne thought
that the hat in the coffin was hers. One shoe only
was on, the other being in the possession of Mr. Crom-
melin. Such of the clothes as were left upon the
body, (for she was buried with every thing on,) are to
be sent to her mother to know if she can identify
them. It is pretty certain, however, that the body is
that of the unfortunate Mary. As yet, nothing has
been developed, that can at all implicate any person
as being concerned in the horrid outrage. Further
examination will take place this day.

   <i>A Horrible Murder</i>.—On Sunday
morning week, Miss Cecilia <u>Rodgers</u>,
(who formerly attended John Anderson's
tobacco store in Broadway, and was
known as <u>the</u> “The beautiful cigar girl”)
left her home, 126 Nassau st., for a
walk; and at the corner of Theatre
Alley she was met and accosted by a
young man, apparently an acquaintance,
	...
the body of Miss Rogers, and it was ev-
ident that she had been horribly out-
	...
city since the murder was committed.—
<i>N. Y. Tribune</i>.	———
   <i>Later</i>.—Some doubt is expressed now,
(says the N. Y. Express of Monday)
whether Miss Rogers was murdered at
Hoboken, or in this city. It is supposed
that she may have been decoyed into
some den this side the river, violated and
then murdered, her violator subsequently
rowing her body over to Hoboken where
it was thrown into the river.
   Mr. Justice Merritt has said it was a
matter of great regret that the body
was not exposed for a day or two,.to give
an opportunity to those who had seen
her on Sunday, the 25th ult., to identify
her, and perhaps to point out and des-
cribe with whom she was, and under
what circumstances she was seen. It
appears that a rope was tied round her
neck, over the top of her bonnet and
round her body in such a way that it
could easily be carried by means of it,
and <u title="Justice">Justiue</u> Matsell is of opinion, from
the nature of the ties, knots, &c., that
they must have been made by seafaring
men.

   T<small>HE</small> M<small>URDER OF</small> M<small>ARY</small> C. R<small>OGERS</small>.—<u>Yester-
terday</u> a meeting was held at Mr. Stoneall's, at
which a committee was appointed to collect sub-
scriptions with the view of offering a reward for
the detection of the murderers of Miss Rogers.
We must confess that we share in the surprise
which has been expressed that the public authori-
ties have not promptly offered a large reward for the
discovery of the perpetrators of a crime which has
filled the community with horror.
   The sum of $<u title="My sum is 457 (from the list in Herald-1841-08-12)">445</u>, we understand, was subscri-
bed, which will be paid upon the conviction of the
murderers, aside from any reward which the civil
authorities may offer.
   In another part of the paper is a report of the ex-
amination of a friend of Miss Rogers in relation
to the circumstances under which she was last
seen.

   T<small>HE</small> M<small>URDER OF</small> M<small>ISS</small> R<small>OGERS</small>.—The body of
this unfortunate girl was yesterday, at the request
of our city authorities, disinterred and brought
from Jersey to this city, and deposited in the dead
house in the Park. And difficult would it be for
the most imaginative mind to conceive a spectacle
more horrible or humiliating to humanity. There
lay, what was but a few days back, the image of its
Creator, the loveliest of his works, and the tene-
ment of an immortal soul, now a blackened and
decomposed mass of putrefaction, painfully dis-
gusting to sight and smell. Her skin which had
been unusually fair was now black as that of a ne-
gro. Her eyes so sunk in her swollen face as to
have the appearance of being violently forced be-
yond the sockets, and her mouth, which “no
friendly hand had closed in death,” was distended
as wide as the ligaments of the jaws would admit,
and wore the appearance of a person who had died
from suffocation or strangulation. The remainder
of her person was alike one mass of putrefaction
and corruption, on which the worms were revelling
at their will. And as if nothing should be want-
ing to send the moral home to men's hearts, and
render it more painfully <u title="'oppressive' in Mohawk Courier">impressive</u>, the young man
who was to have been, in a few days, married to
her, now stood beside the rough box in which all
that remained of her he loved was lying. Her
whom but a few days back, he had seen, “exulting
in her youth,” filled with life, hope and animation,
whom he so ardently wished to make his wedded
wife, to fold to his bosom, to press to “his heart
of hearts,” now lay before him an inanimate mass
of matter, so hideous, horrible and offensive, that
the bare idea of coming in contact with it was al-
most sufficient to make the gorge rise. The re-
mains even of her dress, in which she had been
buried, were already so discolored and half rotten,
as to render it almost impossible to be identified,
and was so impregnated with the effluvia from her
person, that scarcely any person would venture to
touch or examine it.
   The chief object in bringing the body over to this
city, was that it might be identified beyond all
doubt, which it appears had not been hitherto done,
at least to the satisfaction of our city authorities,
until yesterday. Amongst the strangest and most
mysterious circumstances of the murder, is perhaps
the fact that from the hour she last left her mo-
ther's door, to the time when her body was found
floating in the river, no trace whatever of her has
been discovered, nor can any person be found who,
for one moment saw her, in that interim.
   Justices Parker and Merritt and Mr. Calender,
clerk of the Police Office, attended at the dead
house, for several hours yesterday evening for the
purpose of further examining the matter, but they
were unable to elicit more than had been already
known. In the course of the evening a coffin was
procured, into which the unfortunate girl's remains
were removed from the rough box in which they
had been buried, and they still remain in the dead
house in the Park.
   The following is all the evidence which the Po-
lice have been as yet able to obtain on the subject.<a id="Evening-Post-1841-08-12-Case"></a>
   C<small>ASE OF</small> M<small>ARY</small> C. R<small>OGERS</small>.—Daniel C. Payne,
of No. 47 John street, cork cutter, went yesterday
to the Police office, at the request of Justice Park-
ker, to give any information he might possess, or
which might tend to throw any light upon the dis-
appearance of Miss Mary C. Rogers, said to have
been murdered at Hoboken, and made the follow-
ing statements:—“I have known Mary C. Rogers
since October or November last, at which time I
went to board at her mother's, at No. 126 Nassau
street. During my stay there, (which was until
within a few days of the time Mrs. Rogers gave up
keeping boarders,) myself and Miss Rogers formed
an attachment for each other, the result of which
was that we were engaged to be married. The last
time I saw her was on Sunday morning, the 25th
July last.
   About the hour of ten o'clock on that morning, I
was busy shaving myself in my room, when she
came and knocked at my door; upon which I open-
ed the same when she told me she was going to
Mrs. Downing's; when I replied, very well, Ma-
ry, I shall look out for you in the evening. At this
time she appeared cheerful and lively as usual.—
During the time that I had been acquainted with
her she had been to Mrs. Downing's some three or
four times to my knowledge; and two occasions as
she returned from there, I had waited for her about
dark, on the corner of Broadway and Ann street,
until she alighted from an omnibus, and then walk-
ed home with her.
   Mrs. Downing lives in Jane street, No. 68. I
did not go to the corner of Ann street and Broad-
way on this occasion to wait for her, as I had done
before, on account of a very heavy storm coming on
about dusk, and I feeling in my own mind that she
would not leave Mrs. Downing's that night, but re-
main there, as she had done on another occasion.—
Upon leaving the house that morning, which was
about 11 o'clock, I walked directly to my brother's
John Payne's, in Warren street, No. 33, and re-
mained in his company until 1 o'clock part of the
time in the house and part of the time out. When
out of the house, we went to Scott's Bazaar, in Dey
street, where we remained until about one, when
we left there and walked up to Broadway and
parted company near St. Paul's Church. I then
walked up into James street, at Mr. Bickford's,
and read the newspapers until about 2 o'clock, and
then came down, and took my dinner at Goslin's
eating house, in Fulton street. I then went home,
and at 3 o'clock was lying on my bed, and remain-
ed there until about 6 o'clock, when I dressed my-
self and walked down to the Battery, and remain-
ed there until about a quarter past seven o'clock.
When I left, my brother was coming off the Batte-
ry with his children, to whom I spoke for a mo-
ment or <u title="two (in Sunbury American)">so</u>, and then parted. I walked up Broad-
way, and when near Ann street, noticed a storm
was fast coming up, and thinking it was too early
to go to bed, I walked up to Bickford's, in James
street, and remained there until nine o'clock, and
then went home and retired for the night. I was
under the impression that the omnibuses run on
Sundays, and had the weather been clear, I should
have waited for Mary on the corner of Ann street
and Broadway, as usual. I have never known Ma-
ry, since I have been in the house, to keep compa-
ny with any person but myself, and do not know of
her ever having any male person to casually call
upon her.
   Her habits were very domestic, she scarcely
ever leaving the house, and I do not think that she
ever left the house in company with any other per-
son but myself.<!-- Right quote (”) here? -->
   Daniel Payne, on his further examination, said:
—“On my return home on Sunday evening, about
the hour of 9 o'clock, I was asked by Mrs. Hayes,
the aunt of Mary, who was in the house, and who
had come there after I left at 6 o'clock, where Mary
was, when I replied that she had gone to Mrs.
Downing's, when Mrs. Hayes replied that her
mother was very much alarmed about her, and had
gone to her house, (that is Mrs. Hayes' house) to
enquire for her. Nothing further upon the subject
of Mary's absence then passed between us, except-
<d>[Col.4]</d>
ing that Mrs. Hayes made the remark, that she
supposed that she would be home in the morning.
Mrs. Hayes then offered me a light to take to my
room. I declined it, stating that I always went in
the dark. When I took my breakfast on the fol-
lowing morning, Mrs. Rogers remarked that Mrs.
Hayes had gone to her house to see if Mary was
there, and was to return immediately and let me
know. I then went to work, presuming, if all was
not right, that they would let me know at the shop.
   I heard nothing more until I returned home to
my dinner, and then heard that she had not been
either at Mrs. Downing's or Mrs. Hayes', at which
the family were much alarmed. I then commenced
searching for her, and in the first place went to
Mrs. Pitcher's, at Harlem, and made enquiry there
for her, when they informed me she had not been
there. This was the only place that I knew of her
being acquainted out of the family. I next went
to Williamsburg to search for her. I did not know
any one there, and had no reason for going there
any more than any other place, but thought I must
make a general enquiry, and the next day proceed-
ed to Hoboken, also to Staten Island, and also
crossed over the South Ferry, and enquired of dif-
ferent persons at all those places, describing her to
them. On the evening of the same day, I carried
and advertisement to the Sun newspaper, respect-
ing her absence, &c. On the following day, Wed-
nesday, I made further enquiry and searched for
her, and first of all called upon a keeper of a public
house, on the corner of Duane and William streets,
kept by <u>Callas</u>, owning to a note having been received
at the house, by the mother, without signature, that
they could tell something about her, when on enquiry
I ascertained that a young girl had called there and
remained in company with a young man for three
hours; but the description of this girl did not at all
answer the description of Mary, and not only so,
the girl who was there they stated was in the prac-
tice of chewing snuff while she was there, and was
dressed in blue. I then proceeded to Hoboken, it
being between 9 and 10 o'clock, and made inquiry
about Hoboken, and also along the shore, as far as
the Elysian Fields House. I did not make any in-
quiry at the last mentioned house, but did before I
got there. I inquired for her at the ferry, and three
times between the ferry and the house. These in-
quiries were made of two different persons whom I
casually met on the road, and at a public house
close to Van Buskirk's, but obtained no trace of her
whatever. I then returned to the city about 1 or 2
o'clock, and in the afternoon went to my store, but
did not go to work, and returned home again about
7 o'clock.
   After having been in the house a quarter of an
hour, a gentleman, whose name I was informed by
him was Luther, and residing at No. 90 Chambers
street, came into the dining room, where myself
and others were sitting, and informed me that a
body had been found by him in the water near Ho-
boken, which he supposed, form the description of
the dress, to be the body of Miss Rogers, who had
been advertised in the newspapers. I did not go
to Hoboken to identify the body at that time nor
since.
   Before I was out of my bed on the following
morning, Mr. Crommelin came and informed the
family that he had been to Hoboken, and that the
body there found was the body of Mary. I think
it was about half past six (he afterwards said five
o'clock) in the morning when I arose. Mr. Crom-
melin also informed us that the inquest had been
held on the night before, which did away with the
necessity for myself or the family going to Hobo-
ken.—<i>Journal of Commerce</i>.

   <i>Mysterious Murder in Hoboken</i>.—
An inquest was held at Castle Point,
Hoboken, on the 28th ult., on the body
of Mary C. Rogers, for some time
known as the 'beautiful cigar girl' in a
store in Chatham street, in New York,
who, from the decision of the jury,
came to her death by violence commit-
ted by some person or persons unknown,
sufficient to cause her death. The de-
ceased had been absent from her home
in New York since some time on the
<u title="preceding">preceeding</u> Sunday, and appears to have
borne an irreproachable character.—
Her body was found in the river where
it was supposed to have been thrown,
after the desperate act of violence was
committed.

   T<small>HE</small> M<small>URDER OF</small> M<small>ISS</small> R<small>OGERS</small>.—There was another long
examination in this case at the Police Office yesterday, from
8 A. M. to 7 P. M. which resulted in little more than the
identification of body found in the river near Hoboken on
the 28th as that of Mary C. Rogers, who left her home on
the morning of Sunday the 25th. Alfred <u>Cromeline</u>, who had
boarded in the family and was at one time attached to Miss
R., swore positively that the body he saw at Hoboken was
hers, and produced one of her shoes, a sleeve and skirt of
her dress, part of her pantalettes, &c. which he took from
the body and brought home to her mother. Mrs. <u title="Phoebe">Phœbe</u>
Rogers also identified the dress taken from the body found
at Hoboken as that which her daughter wore away on the
morning of the 25th. <u>Cromeline</u>, it appears, had been a fa-
vored suitor of Miss R. but was finally discarded for Daniel
Payne, the substance of whose testimony we gave yesterday.
<u>Cromeline</u> had told Mrs. and Miss R. that whenever they
should be in trouble, to send for him. A note from Mrs. Ro-
gers (in the hand-writing of Mary) asking him to call had
been left for him the Friday before Sunday the 25th, but
he did not go, as he had been coldly received when last there.
On Saturday the 24th, (as A. W. Padley testifies,) the name
of Miss Rogers was written on <u>Cromeline</u>'s slate, and a rose
left in the key-hole of his door. <u>Cromeline</u>, it appears, went
over to Hoboken on Wednesday afternoon, staid till late at
night, during which time the inquest was held and the body
temporarily buried, (as the weather was very hot, and it had
become very offensive;) and when he started to come home,
the boats had ceased running. He walked round to Jersey
City, and found the boats there stopped also, and was obliged
to stay over night. This accounts for the burial of the body
without being seen by her mother or Payne.
   William H. <u>Kiekuck</u>, the sailor, was again rigidly exam-
ined, but nothing elicited to implicate him at all in the affair.
   Henry Mallin and James M. <u>Boullard</u>, of 333 and <u>331</u>
Broadway, who first discovered the body floating in the water
near Hoboken, at 3 o'clock, P. M. of Wednesday, 28th,
were examined, and testified that <u>no jewelry or rings were
on the body when found, though Miss Rogers wore such
away</u>. There was no rope or other fastening about the body.
   These were all the facts elicited of any moment. The ex-
amination will be continued from day to day until the mur-
derers are discovered. The Police, under the direction of
the Mayor and Recorder, are doing all that men can do
to ferret out the criminals. Any person who saw Miss
Rogers any where after leaving her mother's house on the
morning of the 25th, is earnestly requested to communicate
the fact to the Police Office.

		<m8>Reported for the Courier and Enquirer.</m8>
		POLICE.—Thursday.
   <i>The Case of Mary C. Rogers.</i>—The Magistrates
and clerks were occupied yersterday in examining wit-
nesses in this exciting case. But by reference to the
testimony annexed, it will be seen that nothing new
or useful has been elicited—all doubts as to the identity
of the unfortunate girl are now set at rest, and the
only <i>desideratum</i> now is to discover if possible her
brutal murderers. To this end, we in common with
all the city papers have been requested to call pub-
lic attention to this fact—Mary on Sunday said she
was going to Mrs. Downing's in Jane street. Her
most direct route to that quarter of the city, would be
up Broadway to Chamber street, down Chamber to
Hudson, and up Hudson to Jane street, and we have
been devised to ask of any person who may have
seen her on that day, to call at the Police Office, and
give information as to where abouts she was so seen.
Once a single trace of her is discovered, the officers
will follow it up, and we think we may safely say,
that if they once only hear of her alive after she left
her mother's house, a discovery will inevitably follow,
of the inhuman murderers.
   The examinations held yesterday, it will be seen,
shed no light upon the mystery, but the apathy which
has heretofore marked the course of her relations
and friends, and of the man to whom she was engag-
ed, is almost past credence. When they were in-
formed by Mr. Crommelin, who was comparatively
a stranger, that Mary's body had been found at Ho-
boken, not one of them took the pains to cross the
river, and take a last look at her remains. They took
<s>this stranger's word</s> that her body should be cared
for, and beyond that they seemed to have no care.—
Even Payne made no attempt to see her body, and in
fact, could not have positively known up to yester-
day, whether the girl to whom he was soon to be
married, was dead or alive. He heard that she was
dead—that she had been brutally outraged and mur-
dered, and he was satisfied. Even the last offices
were left to be paid to her remains by a stranger. No
parent, relation or friend was there to see her consign-
ed to her grave, and she was buried into her coffin,
if the box that contained her, can be so called, with-
out any regard to propriety, to decency, or humani-
ty. The veriest pauper that was ever thrown upon
charity would have been buried in a more decent
manner than was Mary C. Rogers. We learn that
it is now contemplated to have a public funeral.
   It is but just to the magistrates and officers to
state, that they have thus far shown the most untir-
ing zeal in their efforts to ferret out the authors of
the outrage, and we are <s>safe</s> in predicting that if they
<d>[Col.3]</d>
once obtain a single clue, the rest will be soon trac-
ed out, and the murderers be brought to punishment.
			———
   [Annexed is the evidence taken yesterday.]
   Alfred Crommelin, 19 John street, says that he
went to Mrs. P. Rogers 126 Nassau street to board,
on 7th December, 1840, and remained there till
about the first day of June last, and during that time,
a daughter of Mrs. R., Mary Cecilia had the charge
of the whole house. He did not visit the house after
he took away his baggage.
   About three days before 25th July, Mrs. R. or
Mary called to see him every day, and left a note
signed by Mrs. R., although the note was written by
Mary, requesting him to call on them in Nassau st.,
which he did not do, although he intended to do so
on Sunday the 25th. He did not call for this
reason—that Payne who was addressing Mary, was
a dissipated man, and the family treated him very
coldly; and on reflection he determined to stay at
home and did so, on the 25th, all day. Archibald
Padley staid in the same house in John street all
day. In the evening they went to the battery, thence
to Atlantic Garden, and thence to 127 Cedar st.,
where he slept.
   On Monday and Tuesday he heard that Mary was
missing, and on Wednesday he saw the advertise-
ment for her, and when he saw this he thought there
was something serious about it, as he thought she
was at Mrs. <u>Downings</u> or Mrs. <u>Hays</u>. He then felt
sorry that he had not gone to see them on Sunday
as he had intended, owing to the circumstance that
when he left Mrs. Rogers he told Mary he was sorry
for the step she was about taking, and that if she ever
was in trouble to call on him. He then (on Wednes-
day) went to Mrs. R.'s and saw her and Dan Payne.
Payne left the house as witness came in, which he
thought very singular. Witness asked Mrs. R. what
sent him off in such a hurry, and she said he had
gone to Bellevue to look for Mary. Witness after
hearing the story from Mrs. R. came to the conclu-
sion that Mary had been forcibly detained in some as-
signation house, or some other place, and came im-
mediately to the Police Office and intended to have
seen young Hays, the officer, knowing there was
such a man by reputation as an able officer, and on
enquiring did not see him. Then went to a tavern
near the <a href="http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47e0-d411-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99">Shakspeare Hotel</a>, as he understood that
they received a note that Mary had been seen there
on Sunday, 25th July. I understood that a girl had
been there, from the Landlord Alman, about 2 o'clock
which did not answer Mary's description. He then
went down to Mrs. Rogers, and told them he was
going over to Hoboken to look for her, which he did
that afternoon, 28th July, in company with Arch'd
Padley. Went the river walk up along shore, and
saw a number of people standing on the shore, asked
the cause and received for answer that it was the body
of a drowned female; on looking at the person so
drowned recognized the body to be that of Miss Mary
C. Rogers. Remained with the body all the after-
noon, until the Coroner had taken an inquest, which
was at nearly 9 o'clock at night.
   Witness took a part of the skirt of her dress and a
piece from off her sleeve. The Doctor who was with
the Coroner, gave him the flowers form the inside and
outside of Mary's hat, a garter, the bottom of her pan-
talette, a shoe and a lock of curl of her hair, which he
brought over to Mary's mother, and all of which were
recognized by her and the family. The body was
found a little above the cave at Hoboken. The ferry
being at this time (nearly 11 at night,) closed, he walk-
ed to Jersey city, and found that also closed, when
he slept there and crossed early in the morning. He
re-crossed the next day, at the request of Mrs. R. to
Hoboken, having the evening previous made an ar-
rangement with the Coroner and Dr. Cook to meet
them for the purpose of a further examination. Dr.
C. had written a note to Dr. Beck of N. Y. to meet
them there, but he did not come.
   When he first saw the body he cut the sleeve open
and rubbed her arm for the purpose of identifying her,
and made use of ever proper means for that purpose.
He further says that at the meeting with the Coroner
and Dr. Cook, on the following morning, it was
deemed necessary, in consequence of the great heat
of the weather, to inter the body temporarily, subject
to a future examination, which was done at two feet
from the surface, and in a double coffin.
   Henry Mallin and James M. <u>Bowland</u>, who first
discovered the body floating in the river, were also
examined, and state under oath, that the body was
free from rope or cords of any kind, and that she had
no rings, or breastpin, or jewelry of any kind about
her.
   William <u>Kurkuk</u>, who has before been mentioned,
being the sailor from the North Carolina, was ex-
amined, but his evidence had no possible bearing on
the case, he not having seen her since the 3d of July
last. He has been discharged, and was sent on board
of his vessel again.
   The mother, aunt, and an intimate friend of <u>Marys</u>
were yesterday at the office, and immediately recog-
nized the clothes which had been taken from the cof-
fin, which was brought from Hoboken yesterday, as
belonging to Mary C. Rogers, thus setting at rest for-
ever all doubts as to the identity of the unfortunate
girl.
   By reference to Mr. <u title="Crommelin">Commelin</u>'s statement, it will
be seen that he says Mrs. Rogers or Mary called on
three different days, prior to the 25th July, to see him.
That is explained by Mrs. Rogers, who states that she
went to him to sell a due bill for $52, which a man
who had boarded with her, had given to her in pay-
ment. She had no other object in seeing him.
   Archibald Padley, of No. 19 John street, says, that
he has a room in the same story of the house as Mr.
Crommelin—that they slept there on Saturday night,
and on Sunday night Mr. Crommelin slept at his
brother-in-laws in Cedar street. This witness cor-
roborates Mr. Crommelin's statement in every par-
ticular, as to his conduct, the finding and identifying
the body. On the 23d July, Crommelin showed
witness a note from Mrs. Rogers, requesting him to
call at her house, but the note did not state upon
what business she wished to see him. On Saturday,
24th July, he saw the name of Miss Rogers written
on Mr. C.'s slate, and at the same time he saw a rose
put in the key hole of his door.
   This was the amount of Mr. Padley's testimony,
and as will be seen, is entirely unimportant, except
to corroborate that of Mr. Crommelin, and thus the
affair remains at present.
   At a late hour last evening, His Honor the Mayor
and Justice Parker, were both engaged in examining
witnesses, who had been brought before them in the
evening, but their evidence was of immaterial import.
No new arrests have been made, nor has any fact as
yet been developed, which can in any way add light
to the mystery.<f>

   The only case at this office yesterday, except that
of Mary C. Rogers, worth notice, was that of two
men named Hoasey and Kennedy, who were arrested
by officer Lounsberry, having in their possession a
cow which they had stolen, and for which an owner
is wanted at the Police office.</f>

   M<small>ORE</small> E<small>XPLANATION</small> W<small>ANTED</small>.—The “Evening
Star” says that the statement of Mr. Payne, respect-
ing Mary Rogers, is very singular, and requires more
explanation. This is very true. More explanation
is wanted.

   U<small>NPARALLELED</small> A<small>TROCITY</small>.—Moses Y. Beach, the
poor drivelling vagabond, who keeps the penny Sun
in grease and hot corn, makes a savage attack upon
the humane meeting which was held on Wednesday
evening at Stoneall's, for the purpose of making sub-
scriptions to offer a reward for the murderer of Mary
C. Rogers. Beach is not alone losing his penny
subscribers and advertisers by dozens, scores, and
hundreds, but he loses his senses by wholesale. He
had long since lost his character—and very soon he
will lose the last handful of his own wool, by tear-
ing it off his head in pure vexation. We pity the
poor family of this unmitigated rascal. We shall
have to raise a subscription for them one of these
days. N. B.—Beach subscribed $2 to the Stone-
all subscription. Who did the fellow cheat out of
that sum?

   A<small>SK HIM</small>.—A correspondent states that, a young
man, named Canter, at the Journal of Commerce,
was a suitor of Mary C. Rogers, and was in the con-
stant habit of walking out with her. He was se-
verely beaten about a year ago by three or four ri-
vals, in consequence of visiting her. He has not as
yet been questioned about who the others were in
the habit of visiting Mary C. Rogers.

			<b>General Sessions.</b>
<m9>   Present the Recorder, Judges Noah and Lynch, and
two Aldermen.
   This being the last day of the present term of the
Court, a batch of candidates for the honor of graduating
at the <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40B16FC395F1B7A93C7AB1789D85F438185F9" title="semi-prophetic joke?">State University of Sing Sing</a> were paraded at 11
o'clock. About an hour having been wasted in gossip-
ing, earwigging and talking over matters and things in
general.

   William Henry, a negro, and Owen Lee, a white loafer
indicted for having four wives, were both discharged.
Nobody having ought to say, why they should not be
discharged, as Old Hays phrases it.
	...
   <i>Madame Restell</i>.—The Recorder stated that in this case,
unless an order was obtained from the Supreme Court
for a stay of proceedings in this Court by the first week
of next term, this Court would proceed to pass their sen-
tence on the defendant.
   <i>The Grand Jury, the Police, and the Press</i>.—The Grand
Jury came into Court with a batch of bills, which the
Foreman presented to his Honor the Recorder, and his
Honor immediately rose and told the members of the
Grand Inquest that the Court had great pleasure in say-
ing that the Grand Jury had attended to their duty with
a degree of zeal and indefatigability almost unparalleled
in the annals of the Court. Their Honors could not let
this opportunity pass, without publicly thanking the
members of the Grand Jury for their constant attend-
ance to the public business, and for the unremitting zeal
they had displayed during the present session. The
Court said his Honor would also call the attention of the
Grand Jury to the vigilance displayed by the Police De-
partment of this city, and their Honors wished to bear
testimony to this zeal and vigilance at this present time,
because the public press had taken the advantage of cer-
tain painful occurrences happening in our city, to cen-
sure in a wholesale way the whole of the persons enga-
ged in the administration of the Police and of Criminal
Justice. The officers employed to trace out the offenders
against our laws did, at all times, make use of the most
urgent despatch, but it could not at all times be known to
the public, nor was it proper, or delicate, for them to
make explanatory statements in the public prints. The
public were necessarily ignorant how, or when the Po-
lice were employed by day and by night, and it was due
to them for this Court to make this explanation to the
Grand Jury, in order to repel the unjust and calumnious
insinuations which had been latterly preferred publicly
against them.*
   His Honor said that with such a vigilant District Attor-
ney and a Court not backward in administering the laws,
it was impossible for offenders to escape; and with this
observation he thanked the Grand Jury and dismissed
them.
   Their Honors then adjourned to the first Monday in
September.
———
   * As this closing speech of his Honor to the Grand Jury
was intended as a sort of rebuke to the Press in general,
and to ourselves in particular, we will take the liberty of
reiterating one fact for our own justification, and for the
sake of enlightening his Honor. Mary Rogers it is sup-
posed, was murdered on the 27th ult. The inquest was
held at Hoboken on the 29th or 30th. On the Saturday
following an account of the facts was published in this
paper, and on the following day, Sunday, in the course of
our enquiries, we applied to one of the most courteous
and communicative of the Police functionaries to know if
any thing had been done or any discoveries made. His
reply was, on hearing the story of the <u>girls</u> fate, “<i>Good
God! it is the first we or I have heard of it</i>.” We have no
other comment to make now, in our own justification, and
the Court of Sessions may make the most of this fact.

			<b>City Intelligence.</b>
<m9>   T<small>HE</small> M<small>ARY</small> R<small>OGERS</small> M<small>YSTERY</small>.—We can only state that
nothing has been elicited calculated to throw any fur-
ther light on the whereabouts of, or the miscreants who
perpetrated this cold-blooded and heartless murder. The
Magistrates yesterday had the body recognized as that
of Mary beyond the shadow of a doubt. They also took
the following statements under oath, which implicate no
one, and leave the mystery just as much mystery as be-
fore.
   Alfred <u>Cromelin</u> residing at 19 John street, went to
board with Mrs. Rogers on the 7th December, 1840, and
staid until the 1st of June, and during that time Mary
Rogers had the superintendence of the house. Mr. <u>Cro-
melin</u> did not visit the house after he took his baggage
away.
   Mr. <u>Cromelin</u> then states that three days before the
25th of July, Mrs. Rogers or her daughter called every
day to see him, and left a note signed by Mrs. R. request-
ing him to call at their residence, which request Mr. C.
did not comply with, because Daniel Payne, who was
paying his addresses to Miss Rogers, was a very dissipa-
ted man, and the family treated him very coldly, and on
reflection he determined to remain home, and did so all
day. On Sunday, the 25th, Archibald Padley remained
in the same house in John street all day, with the excep-
tion of the evening, when he went to the Battery with<!-- Padley went with Padley. -->
Padley, and from thence to Atlantic Garden and also to
No. 127 Cedar street, where deponent slept.
   The next day Mr. C. heard she was missing; on Tues-
day he heard the same, and on Wednesday he was shown
the advertisement, and thought there was something se-
rious in it, or that she was either at Mrs. Downing's or at
Mrs. Hayes. Mr. C. then says he felt uneasy because he
had not called, owing to the circumstance that when he
left Mrs. Rogers' house he told Mary that he was sorry for
the step she was about taking, and that if she was ever
in trouble, to call on him. Mr. C. says he then went and
saw Mrs. Rogers with Payne sitting in the room. Payne
left when <u>Cromelin</u> went in, which <u>Cromelin</u> thought
singular at the time, and asked Mrs. Rogers what sent
Payne off in such a hurry. She replied, he had gone to
Bellevue to look after Mary. After having heard Mrs.
Rogers' story, he, <u>Cromelin</u>, concluded that Mary was
forcibly detained in some assignation house, or some
other place and came off to the Police Office to one Hays,
but did not see him. He then left the office, and called
at a small public house, opposite the <u>Shakspeare</u>, and <u>left
word that he was going over to Hoboken</u> along with
Archibald <u>Pedley</u> to look for Marry.
   They went over and walked up by the side of the river,
when they saw a number of people looking at a drowned
female, which they recognized as the body of Mary Ro-
gers. Mr. C. says he staid until the inquest was over, and
took home a piece of the skirt of her dress, and the Doctor
gave him the flowers from out of Mary's hat. One of her
garters, the bottom of her pantalette, a shoe, and a lock
of her hair, which he gave to Mrs. Rogers, who recog-
nized them all.
   The body was above the cave at Hoboken. Mr. C. found
the ferry that night to be shut, and walked to Jersey City,
but being unable to get across there, he slept at New Jer-
sey and returned in the morning. At the request of Mrs.
Rogers he re-crossed to Hoboken, to have an interview
with Dr. Cook, who had written to Dr. Beck, to meet
them there. At this meeting it was deemed necessary in
consequence of the heat of the weather to temporarily
inter the body.
   Henry <u>Mallen</u>, of 333 Broadway, and James M. <u>Boulard</u>,
of <u>321</u> Broadway, stated that, being at Hoboken on the
28th of July, they saw a body floating between two
tides, and about three hundred yards from the shore.—
They procured a boat, rowed to the body and brought it
to she shore. It proved to be a female, and they under-
stood it was Miss Rogers. When found, it was free
from rope, cord or any thing attached to it. There were
no rings, breastpin or jewelry on her person.
   William H. <u>Kukuck</u>, the sailor, states that he boarded
with Mrs. Rogers about a year back for two weeks and a
half. Left there and went on board the U. S. cutter Ha-
milton, Captain <u>Sturges</u>, at Boston, was discharged last
June, and came to this city about the 3d July. Called at
Mrs. Rogers, saw Mary, and had a conversation with her.
At this time he boarded with his sister, Mrs. <u>Noon</u>, in
Ludlow street. Has not spoken to either Mrs. Rogers or
her daughter since the 3d of July. He stayed with his
sister about nine or ten days, and went to New Bedford,
where he stayed about a week, and went to see a young
woman and came back to the city in a steamboat, and ar-
rived here on the 24th of July, and went to his sister's in
Ludlow street. While at New Bedford his clothes were
stolen, and he arrived here without a jacket or vest to
wear.
   On the 27th he shipped on board the North Carolina.—
He received a jacket at the shipping office in Water st.—
He slept at his sister's in Ludlow street on the night of the
24th; took breakfast and left the house a short time after
10 o'clock; went to a Mrs. Anderson's in 17th street and
staid until 11 o'clock, and then went to the <u>8th</u> avenue;
met a person called John Miller, who was watering a horse.
After he had finished, both went then to the North river
and took a bathe, and from there to a porter house and
got something to drink; he then left Miller and went to
his sister's, and after staying a short time went to the foot
of Barclay street, and then to Courtlandt street and home
to his sister's. In the evening <u>Kukuck</u> says he went to
Centre Market and to <u title="Now Jackson?">Walnut</u> street, and slept at Ludlow
street. The next morning, the 26th, went to the ship-
ping rendezvous, but was too late, and returned home,
<i>told his sister</i> he had shipped to go on board the North
Carolina; went next to a sailor boarding house kept by
Robinson in Water street. He took tea at Robinson's and
on the following morning went with Robinson and ship-
ped. He then went up town, or rather to the Five Points
—went to bed with a girl; after that to the rendezvous,
got some clothes, and went on board the North Carolina,
it being about one o'clock.
   Archibald W. Padley, the person spoken of in <u>Crome-
lin</u>'s statement, corroborated that gentleman's story in
every particular.
   The only part of this statement which need to be copied
verbatim is the concluding. Mr. Padley boarded with
Mrs. Rogers and knew Mary. He left in June last. On
the 23d July Mr. C. showed Padley a note from Mrs.
Rogers, requesting him to call at her house, but did not
state what for. On Saturday the 24th of July, Padley
saw the name of <i>Miss Rogers written on Mr. C.'s slate,
and also saw a rose put in the key hole of his room at the
same time</i>.
   <u title="Phoebe">Pheobe</u> Rogers says she has seen the dress taken from
the body, and that it is the clothing of Mary Cecilia
Rogers, and the same she wore on Sunday, the 25th of
July.</m9>

		[COMMUNICATED.]
   Moses Y. Beach, Esq.—In your paper of this
day an editorial article on the fifth column very
emphatically, and in a very harsh and ungenerous
manner, condemns the laudable enterprise of rais-
ing by subscription a sum of money to be offered
as a means, if possible, of ferreting out the wretch
or wretches whose hands are stained with the in-
nocent blood of the unfortunate Miss Mary C.
Rogers—a more foul and disgraceful murder than
which is not in the whole catalogue of crime.—
Now, sir, as a daily reader of your paper, and one
not wishing to be <i>guzzled</i>, allow me to ask, where
is the sincerity or consistency of your course, that
while condemning, if you please, the raising by
subscription the sum of money as above, you
yourself have subscribed to that very fund, and
your name may be found published in the list of
subscribers—by a reference to the Herald of this
day. How do you explain yourself?		Q<small>UERY</small>.
   R<small>EPLY</small>.—This particularly courteous communi-
cation can be fully replied to, in very few words.
In the first place the writer deceives himself in
regarding our remarks yesterday on this subject
as a “harsh and ungenerous” condemnation of
the <i>enterprise</i> in question. We said not a word
against the <i>enterprise</i>; we only said that the most
graceless vagabonds in our city had intruded
themselves into a prominent position in it; and
that, too, for sinister motives. This is true to the
letter, and we repeat it even more emphatically
than we yesterday asserted it. But of this, more
anon.
   In the second place, and lastly, the name refer-
red to by the writer of the above epistle, if it is on
the list at all, was never put there by the proprie-
tor of this paper, nor with his knowledge nor con-
sent;—consequently, it can be nothing more nor
less than <i>a rank forgery</i>. So Mr. “Query” has a
full explanation of all he asks.
   But “while our hand is in,” we will, with his
permission, add a few words “on our own hook.”
We will ask him to look at the proceedings of the
meeting held on Wednesday evening, ostensibly
to promote this “enterprise.” He appears to have
seen the report, and it is to be presumed he is
aware of the character of the print in which it ap-
pears;—for not a second one could be found in
the city that would disgrace its columns by and
insertion of it.
   The first thing that will strike his attention is
the organization of the meeting. The report says
the meeting was “numerous and highly respecta-
ble,” and was organized by William H. Attree,
who called the meeting to order and appointed the
officers. How “highly respectable” it <i>must</i> have
been! Having got his preciously “numerous and
highly respectable” meeting so far, this same mas-
ter of ceremonies, Attree, says he “<i>eloquently</i> <u>ad-</u>
addressed the meeting,” and “offered the follow-
ing preamble and resolutions, which were unani-
mously adopted,” &c. “Mr. Attree” then pro-
ceeded and did all the other business of this pre-
cious meeting, and concluded by “Resolving una-
nimously that the proceedings be published in all
the city papers.” How they <i>did</i> publish them!—
Why there is not another paper in the city besides
the organ of the miserable scamp who <i>drummed up</i>,
organized, and <i>used up</i> this meeting, that would ad-
mit the report in its columns on any considera-
tion! His very name alone would prevent the re-
solved publication from being made in any print,
even though but tolerably decent and respectable,
in the city; but when to the odiousness of his own
name he adds that attached to some others paraded
in the committee he appointed to act ostensibly
with him, but in reality <i>for</i> him—and themselves
a little—the very idea of publishing “in all the
city papers” is as amusing as it is preposterous
and impudent.
   The every-where-acknowledged-vagabond, and
no-where-tolerated scamp, who came from the
gutters of Grub street, (and had a narrow escape
from Bow street, at that,) to regulate the affairs of
our city, in his “unanimously adopted” preamble,
says for himself and for his officers and meeting,
that “without desiring to cast unnecessary <i>censure</i>
upon any of the authorities, they <i>deprecate</i> the ap-
parent apathy that has characterized the Chief
Magistrates of the States of New Jersey and New
York, and the authorities of the county of New
York.”!!
   Shade of the Penningtons, the Clintons, the
Morses, what a spectacle is this! To what a
pass has society arrived in this city, when really
<i>decent citizens</i> can be wheedled into a company,
and be trumpeted forth as a “numerous and highly
respectable meeting,” held to enable a foreign va-
gabond, fresh from the stews and gutters of London
—an unwashed, bloated, besotted, degraded, dis-
graced, and universally despised fugitive from the
London police, to thus insult them, their fellow
citizens, their laws, their institutions, and their
“Chief Magistrates.”!! The thing out-Herods
Herod! Is it to be wondered at, that after re-
ceiving the countenance and aid of Roderick N.
Morrison, and two or three other decent men, in
<i>such</i> an “enterprise,” (as “Query” calls it,) the
wretch should push his audacity a little further,
and demand of all the city papers promulgation
through their columns, of his infamous and auda-
cious insults? And is it strange his demand was as
indignantly repelled by the city press, as his in-
trusion into the company of their conductors,
would be? We apprehend a further reply is un-
necessary.

   ☞ We received yesterday no less than seven-
teen communications relative to the all-exciting
case of Miss Rogers, each of which propounded
to us one or more questions, all varying in the ob-
ject which appeared to enlist the special interest
of the enquirer. To answer them all, if it was in
our power to do so, would occupy a large portion
of our paper; but it is entirely <i>out</i> of our power—
for the reason that, not being gifted with the pro-
perties of omnipresence, nor even of clairvoyance,
we are no better informed in reference to the
causes and effects enquired about, than any one
else who will take the trouble to read the public
papers.

		POLICE OFFICE—Y<small>ESTERDAY</small>.
			<m9>[Reported for the Sun.]</m9>
   T<small>HE</small> H<small>OBOKEN</small> M<small>URDER</small>.—The police authori-
ties were busily occupied yesterday in the inves-
tigation of this affair, and we present our anxious
readers with the results of their labors, in the fol-
lowing affidavits. We may state that the clothing
in which the mangled body was wrapped, were
yesterday fully identified as that worn by the ill-
fated Mary Rogers, by her mother, aunt, and
an intimate female friend.
   Alfred Crommelin, of No. 19 John street, being
duly sworn, deposes and says that he went to
Mrs. <u title="Phoebe">Phœbe</u> Rogers' house to board on the 7th
Dec., 1840, and remained there until about the
first of June last, and that during that time a
daughter of Mrs. Rogers, Mary Cecilia, had the
superintendence of the whole house. Deponent
did not visit the house after he took away his bag-
gage. That three days previous to the 25th of
July Mrs. Rogers or her daughter Mary called eve-
ry day for the purpose of seeing deponent, and left
a note for him to call on them at their residence
in Nassau street, which request deponent did
not comply with, although it was his intention to
do so on Sunday the 25th July following, for the
following reasons:—that Daniel Payne, who was
paying his attentions to Miss Mary, was a very
dissipated man, and the family treated him very
coldly, and on reflection he determined to remain
home, and did so all day on Sunday the 25th. Ar-
chibald Padley remained in the same house in
John street all day, with the exception of the eve-
ning, when he went in company with Padley to<!-- Padley went with Padley. -->
the Battery, and from thence to the Atlantic Gar-
den, and from thence to 127 Cedar street, where
deponent slept.
   On Monday, the 26th July he heard that Mary
was missing; on Tuesday he heard the same, and
on Wednesday morning he was shown the ad-
vertisement in the newspaper; when deponent
read the same he believed that there was some-
thing serious in it, for previously he thought she
was up at her cousin's, <u>Mr.</u> Downing's or <u title="Mrs. Hayes?">Mr.
<s>Hog's</s></u>; deponent then felt extremely sorry that he
had not called upon her, owing to the circumstance
that when he left Mrs. Roger's house he told Ma-
ry that if ever she was in trouble to call on him.
I then went immediately to Mrs. Roger's home
and saw her and Payne sitting in the room. Payne
left the home in a hurry; asked what took him
off, and Mrs. Rogers said he had gone to Bellevue
to look after Mary. After I had heard the story
from Mrs. Rogers I left, and concluded in my own
mind that Mary was forcibly detained in some
assignation house or some other place, and from
thence went immediately to the police office,
and intended to have seen young Hays, the police
officer, knowing there was such a man by reputa-
tion as an able officer, but on enquiry did not see
him. I then left the office, and called at a little
tavern opposite the <u>Shakspeare</u> Hotel, as I under-
stood that Mrs. Rogers had received a note that
Mary had been seen there on Sunday, the <s>????</s>
25th July. I understood that a girl had been there,
that did not answer Mary's description. I then
went down to Mrs. Rogers', and told them I was
going over to Hoboken, New Jersey, to look for
her, which I did that afternoon, (July 28th,) in com-
pany with Archibald Padley; went the river walk,
up along shore, saw a number of people standing
on the shore; asked the cause, and was told it was
the body of a drowned female, on looking at
which I recognized it to be that of Miss Mary C.
Rogers. I remained with the body all the after-
noon until the Coroner had taken an inquest,
<d>[Col.6]</d>
which was at nearly 9 o'clock at night—deponent
took a part of the skirt of her dress, and a piece
from off the sleeve. Doctor Cook, who was asso-
ciated with the Coroner, gave him the flowers
from outside and inside of Mary's hat, a garter, the
bottom of her pantalettes, a shoe, and a lock or
curl of her hair, which deponent brought over to
Mary's mother, and all of which were recognized
by her and the family. Her body was found a
little above the cave, at Hoboken—the ferry at
that time, nearly eleven o'clock, being closed,
deponent walked to the Jersey City Ferry,
and found that was also closed, when he
slept at the city of New Jersey that night
and crossed early in the morning. At the
request of Mrs. Rogers and her family, deponent
recrossed to Hoboken the next morning, having
the evening previous made an arrangement with
the Coroner and Dr. Cook to meet them for the
purpose of a further examination. Dr. Cook had
written a note to Dr. Beck of New York to meet
them there, but business prevented him from so
doing—deponent further says that when he first
saw the body he cut her sleeve open and rubbed
her arm for the purpose of identifying her, and
also made use of every proper means for the
same purpose—deponent further says that at the
meeting between the Coroner, Dr. Cook and himself
at Hoboken on the morning after the inquest, it
was deemed necessary, in consequence of the
great heat of the weather, to temporarily inter her
body, which was done at two feet from the sur-
face of the earth, and in a double coffin.
   Archibald W. Padley was likewise examined.—
He corroborated the statements of Crommelin,
and also stated that on the 23d of July Crommelin
showed him a note from Mrs. Rogers, requesting
Crommelin to call at her house, without stating
the particular business—that on Saturday, the
24th he saw Miss Rogers' name written on Crom-
melin's slate, and also a rose which had been
<u title="placed">placced</u> in the keyhole of the door.
   We add the following affidavit, made by one of
the persons who first discovered the body at Ho-
boken:
   Henry Mallin, of 333 Broadway, deposes that
on Wednesday, the 28th of July, between 3 and 4
o'clock in the afternoon, he was at Hoboken in
company with James M. <u>Boulard</u>, and that whilst
walking on the river walk just above the cave,
they discovered a body floating between two
tides, between two and three hundred yards from
the shore, when deponent ran as far as the Elysian
Fields dock, in company with said <u>Boulard</u>, and
procured a boat, rowed to said body, and brought
it to the shore, which body proved to be that of a
female, and who deponent understands to be that
of Mary Cecilia Rogers, that when said body was
found it was perfectly free, without rope, cord,
or anything attached to the same, that <u title="there">they</u> were
no rings, breastpin, or any other jewelry on her
person.
   This affidavit is fully corroborated by Mr. <u>Bou-
lard</u>.

   E<small>XAMINATION IN THE CASE OF</small> M<small>ISS</small> R<small>OGERS</small>.—
William H. <u>Kiekuck</u>, seaman on board the United
States ship North Carolina, being examined, stated
that about a year since he boarded with Mrs. Ro-
gers, in Nassau street, for two and a half weeks,
and then left and joined the United States Revenue
Cutter Hamilton, at Boston, and was discharged
from her the end of last June, and came to this
city 3d July, and went again to Mrs. Rogers,
where he saw Mary C. Rogers, having previously
known her. Deponent at this time boarded with
his sister Moore, in Ludlow street, and has never
seen or spoken to Mrs. Rogers, or her daughter,
Mary, since the above mentioned 3d July. Depo-
nent staid with his sister nine or ten days, and then
went to New Bedford, where he remained about a
week; went there to see a young woman and came
back to this city in a steamboat, and arrived the
24th July last, again stopping with his sister in
Ludlow street. His clothes were stolen from him
while in New Bedford, and when he arrived in this
city he had neither jacket <u>or</u> vest to wear. On the
27th July, he shipped and went on board the Uni-
ted States ship North Carolina, received a jacket at
the shipping office at the time he shipped, in
Water street. Deponent slept at his sister's in
Ludlow street, on the night of the 24th July, took
breakfast and left her house a little after 10 o'clock,
and went to his sister's-in-law, Mrs. Anderson, in
Seventeenth street, near Broadway. Left there a
little after 11 A. M.; went to <u>Ninth</u> Avenue near
Seventeenth street, and met a person called John
Miller, and soon after went with him to the North
river at the foot of Twenty first street; walked
down the river a short distance and took a bath;
went to a porter house near Thirteenth street and
got some drink. There left Miller, and returned
to Mrs. Moore's, his sister's. Soon after went to
the foot of Barclay street, thence to Courtlandt
street, and then to Mrs. Moore's in Ludlow street,
took supper and went to Centre market, kept by
Charles Reynolds, there met his brother, got some
drink, and went to the Hook in <u title="Now Jackson?">Walnut</u> street, and
after being there a short time returned to Mrs.
Moore's in Ludlow street, and retired to bed. On
the morning of the 26th July went to the shipping
rendezvous, but was too late, the doctor not being
there; returned home and told Mrs. Moore that he
has shipped on board the North Carolina. Be-
tween 12 and 1 o'clock dined; left home telling
his sister he was going on board; went to Robin-
son's sailor boarding house, in Water street, and
engaged board; talked with shipmates; took
tea at <u>Robinsyn</u>'s about seven o'clock; then took a
walk and stopped at no particular place; returned
at ten o'clock and went to bed. Next morning he
conversed at Robinson's door; went to the shipping
office and shipped; then went to the Five Points;
returned to the rendezvous, got some clothes, and
went on board the North Carolina, it being then
about one o'clock.
   Henry Mallin, of No. 333 Broadway, deposed,
that on Wednesday, the 28th July, between three
and four o'clock, P. M. he was at Hoboken, in com-
pany with James M. <u>Boullard</u>, and while walking
on the river walk, just above the cave, they dis-
covered a body floating between two tides, between
two and three hundred yards from the shore, when
deponent ran as far as the Elysian Field's Dock, in
company with said <u>Boullard</u>, and procured a boat,
rowed to said body, brought it to the shore, and
placed it on the beach; which body proved to be
that of a female, and which deponent understood
to be that of Mary Cecilia Rogers. That when
said body was found it was perfectly free, without
rope, cord, or any thing attached to it; there were
no rings, breast pin, or any other jewelry on her
person.
   James M. <u>Boullard</u>, of No. <u>321</u> Broadway, cor-
roborated every thing in the statement of Mr. Mal-
lin.
   Alfred Crommelin, of No. 19 John street, de-
posed, that he boarded with Mrs. Rogers, 126 Nas-
sau street, from the 7th December, 1840, to the 1st
June last, and that Mary C. Rogers had the whole
house during the time he was there.
   Deponent did not visit the house after he took
away his baggage. That three days prior to the
25th July, Mrs. Rogers or her daughter Mary called
every day to the deponent's, and left a note for him
signed by Mrs. Rogers, although the body of the
same was written by Miss Rogers, requesting him
to call on them at their residence in Nassau street,
which request deponent did not comply with, al-
though it was his intention to do so on Sunday, the
25th of July following, for the following reasons—
that Daniel Payne, who was paying his attentions
to Miss Mary, was a very dissipated man, and that
the family had treated deponent very <u title="coldly">cooly</u>, and on
reflection he determined to remain at home, and
did so all day, on Sunday the 25th. Archibald
Padley remained in the same house in John street
all day, with the exception of the evening, when
deponent went in company with Padley to the Bat-
tery—thence to the Atlantic Garden, and thence to
127 Cedar street, where deponent slept.
   On Monday, the 26th, he heard that Mary was
missing; on Tuesday heard the same; and on Wed-
nesday morning he was shown the advertisement.
When deponent read the same he believed there
was something serious about it, for previously he
thought that she was up at her cousins, Mrs. Dow-
ning's, or Mrs. Hayes. Deponent then felt ex-
tremely sorry he had not called to see her, owing to
the circumstance that when he left Mrs. Rogers'
house, deponent told Mary he was sorry for the step
she was about taking, and that if she was ever in
trouble to call on him. Deponent then went im-
mediately to her house, and saw Mrs. Rogers and
Daniel Payne, sitting in the room. Payne left the
house when deponent came in, which deponent
thought was very singular at the time. Deponent
asked Mrs. Rogers what sent him off in such a hur-
ry. She said he had gone to Bellevue to look after
Mary.
   After deponent had heard the story from the old
lady, he left and concluded in his own mind that
Mary was forcibly detained in some assignation
house, or some other place, and came immediately
up to the police office, and intended to have seen
young <u>Hayes</u>, the police officer; but on enquiry,
did not see him. Deponent then left the office and
went to a small tavern opposite <u>Shakspeare</u> Hotel,
as he understood that Mrs. Rogers had received a
note that Mary had been seen there on Sunday,
25th July. Understood that a girl had been there,
from the landlord, called Alman, at about 2 o'clock,
which did not answer Mary's description. Depo-
nent then returned to Mrs. Rogers, and told them
he was going over to Hoboken to look for her, which
he did that afternoon, in company with Archibald
Padley,—went the river walk along the shore, and
saw a number of people on the shore—asked the
cause, received for answer, that it was the body of
a drowned female. On looking at the person, de-
ponent recognized the body to be that of Miss Mary
C. Rogers. Remained with the body all the after-
noon, until the Coroner had taken an inquest,
which was at nearly 9 o'clock at night. Deponent
took a part of the skirt of her dress, and a piece
from off the sleeve.
   Doctor Cook, who was associated with the Coro-
ner, gave him the flowers from inside and outside
of Mary's hat, a garter, the bottom of her panta-
lette, a shoe, and a curl of her hair, which depo-
nent brought over to Mary's mother, and all of
which was recognized by her and the family. Her
body was found a little above the cave at Hoboken.
The ferry at Hoboken at this time, nearly 11 o'-
clock at night, being closed, deponent walked to
the Jersey City Ferry, and found that was also
closed, when he slept at the Jersey City Hotel
that night, and crossed early in the morning. At
the request of Mrs. Rogers and her family, depo-
nent re-crossed to Hoboken the next morning—
having the evening previous made an arrangement
<d>[Col.4]</d>
with the Coroner and Doctor Cook, to meet them
for the purpose of a further examination. Doctor
Cook had written a letter to Doctor Beck, of New
York, to meet them there, but business prevented
him from so doing. Deponent further says, that
when he first saw the body he cut her sleeve open,
and rubbed her arm for the purpose of identifying
her, and also made use of every proper means for
the same purpose. Deponent also says, that at the
meeting between the Coroner, Doctor Cook and
himself at Hoboken, on the morning after the in-
quest was held on Mary's body, it was deemed ne-
cessary, in consequence of the great heat of the wea-
ther, to temporarily inter the body, which was
done, at two feet from the surface of the earth, and
in a double coffin.
   Archibald W. Padley of No. 19 John street, cor-
roborated the statements of Mr. Crommelin, as far
as he was concerned and in company with him.—
In addition he stated that on the 23d of July last
Mr. Crommelin showed him a note from Miss Ro-
gers, requesting him to call at her house, but did
not state what the particular business was. On
Saturday, the 24th of July, last, he saw the name
of Miss Rogers written on Mr. Crommelin's slate,
and also a rose put in the key hole of his door at
the same time.
   <u title="Phoebe">Phœbe</u> Rogers, of No. 126 Nassau street, depo-
sed that she has this day seen the dress, now in the
police office, taken from the person of a drowned
female at Hoboken, and that it is the clothing of
her daughter, Mary <u>Cecelia</u> Rogers, who had the
same on her person when she left her house on
Sunday morning, the 25th of July last.—<i>Express</i>.

Office yesterday, parts of the dress taken from the body
of this unfortunate girl were identified by her mother,

which she wore on the day she left home. The two
young men who found the body were re-examined, but
nothing elicited beyond what has already been publish-

was not important. The matter is yet shrouded in

three weeks have now elapsed, since the murder
of this girl, and yet there is no discovery of the
murderer, nor indeed, any clue or suspicion as to
who he is. The probability is, she was decoyed
into some one of the New York assignation hou-
ses and violated, and then to conceal that crime,
murdered and thrown into the Hudson on the Ho-
boken side. What was the mortal agony of that
poor girl, in her extremity, no mind can conceive,
It cannot be that such crimes shall go undiscov-

   ☞ The Investigation of the Murder of Miss Rogers was
actively prosecuted yesterday at both the Police Offices. A
great number of persons were examined, but nothing impor-
tant elicited. The Police have strong hopes, however, that
a clue to the murder is not far off.
   The impression gains strength among those best informed
that the unfortunate woman was not murdered at Hoboken
but in this City. Such is our opinion. How could she, so
well known, have visited Hoboken on a fair Sunday without
being recognized? No! her life was taken in some den of
infamy in this City. More anon.

<d>[Col.3]</d>
   ☞ The Sun of yesterday had a very unwarrantable attack on the
Meeting at Stoneall's on Wednesday evening last to aid the discov-
ery of the Murderers of Miss Rogers. Mr. Attree can defend himself
—but why assail others?—As to Mr. Beach's denial that he subscribed
$2 toward the Reward offered, it is a miserable evasion. <i>The $2 was
subscribed by his son in the presence and by the direction of Beach</i>.
How paltry, then, to assert that <i>he</i> did not subscribe, and pronounce
his signature a forgery?

			POLICE.—Friday.
   <i>The Case of Miss Rogers</i>.—In the course of yes-
terday the Mayor examined two more witnesses, up-
on the subject of this outrage, but their testimony
was of no importance except to clear up some doubts
which remained upon some of the evidence previous-
ly taken. No new arrests have been made, nor have
any new facts been developed.
   At the Upper Police Office the magistrates and of-
ficers have been very actively engaged in this affair.
Several arrests have been made, but no new facts
have been discovered. Until something more <u title="definite">defi-
nate</u> is brought to light, the authorities have request-
ed that no more publications be made, as they tend to
keep up a feverish excitements in the public mind.
   The Grand Jury, which adjourned on Thursday,
have discharged all the complaints against Isaac J.
Wood, so that he stands now where he did previous
to his first arrest, with the exception that he is about
$12,000 out of pocket, that sum having been taken
from him at the Police Office and paid over to the
third hands.
   Officers Baily and Horne last evening brought up
a man named Andrew Myers, a married man, who
keeps a vegetable market stand in Washington mar-
ket, charged with attempting to commit a rape on a
little girl aged 12 or 13 years of age, who lived in
the same house with himself in Washington street,
near Barclay. He was held to bail to answer the
charge.

<m9>		[From the Journal of Commerce.]
   The great excitement now prevailing in this city with
regard to the violation and murder of Miss Rogers, must
not be allowed to die away without producing some be-
neficial result to the morals and safety of the citizens of
our beloved commonwealth.
   Look, if you please, to the history of our unfortunate
city for the last five years, and is not the page which re-
cords the events of that space of time, black with the
stains of <u title="guilt">gilt</u> and crime? Crimes of the worst descrip-
tion have been committed, and are still unrevenged.
What punishment fell to the lot of those “round-rimmer
rowdies” who attacked the dwelling-house of Mr. Tap-
pan, and burned his furniture; or to the violators of the
house of religion in Chatham street; or to the sacrilegious
ruffians who destroyed Mr. Ludlow's church in Spring
street; or to the soap lock sackers of Mr. Hart's store; or
to the murderer of Ellen Jewett; or to the rowdy who
murdered the poor watchman at a gambling house in the
Bowery, whose butchered victim is yet unavenged; or
to the villain who killed the watchman in <a href="http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47e0-d6c8-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99">Coffee House</a>
<a href="http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/5e66b3e8-b347-d471-e040-e00a180654d7">slip</a>? Ezra White is still unhung, and the gallows has
been cheated of its due. What attempts were ever made
to arrest the “Hook rowdies,” who entered the house of
a German in Grand Street, on a New Year's eve, and rav-
ished his daughter—(a poor deaf and dumb girl)—before
the eyes of his family? During this same night, a gen-
tleman who was walking towards home with his wife,
was assaulted and shamefully beaten in a public street
(the Bowery,) his wife forced away from him and viola-
ted, by the same gang of ravishers, and not one of them
has ever been arrested.
   The National Theatre has been twice burned down
from the act of incendiaries, and the last time a young
girl was crushed beneath the smoking ruins—and the
person accused of the crime, and against whom suspi-
cion is very strong, has never been tried—our city has
been disgraced by the villanies of pipe layers, procurers
of illegal voters, perjurers, forgers, bank robbers, swin-
dlers, ravishers, murderers, burners, burglars, thieves,
and watch stuffers, the most of whom are well known to
the police magistrates, and are the friends and compan-
ions of police officers, and are protected by the-stool-pi-
geon system. Are not these facts? It is unsafe and dan-
gerous for a female to walk the streets alone by day or
night. Can any man say that his life and his property
are his own, and not liable to be taken from him every
hour? Nothing is safe from the outrages of these ruf-
fians. And why have we no protection from the city
government? Let a public meeting be called; men of
influence and standing in the community are ready and
willing to join a movement of the kind. Whenever the
citizens rise in their strength, they can always gain
their object if it be a worthy one, and surely the safety
of our lives and property may be properly so denomina-
ted. Let us have a reform in the police system.</m9>
   There will be no confidence in the administration
of justice here till such judges as Noah and Lynch
are expelled from the bench, and our Police system
be re-organized on the day and night preventive
method.

<d>[Col.2]</d>
   A<small>NOTHER</small> E<small>XTRAORDINARY</small> O<small>CCURENCE</small>.—C<small>ASE
OF</small> <u title="'Melinda' in Tribune-1841-08-07">M<small>ATILDA</small></u> H<small>OAG</small>.—This woman has been long
known by the police to be most abandoned pros-
titute, in the employment of a man who, through
her agency, picks the pockets of her victims, under
circumstances that prevent prosecutions, and em-
boldens them in the continuance of these abomina-
ble practices.
   The law declares that “<i>all common prostitutes who
have no lawful employment, whereby to maintain them-
selves, are vagrants</i>,” and may, on conviction, be sent
to the Alms House or Penitentiary for six months.
Justice Matsell, after much labor and the examina-
tion of several witnesses, interrupted by a habeas
corpus, allowed by his Honor the Recorder, and ano-
ther by his Honor Judge Lynch, consented, at the
request of the counsel of Matilda, to associate with
him in the proceeding his Honor the Recorder.
Jusice Matsell, with the knowledge and approval
of the Recorder, convicted her of the offence upon
clear evidence, and committed her to the keeper of
the Penitentiary. Before she could be conveyed to
the place assigned, Judge Lynch granted another
habeas corpus, upon which she was brought before
him; and in order to give greater dignity to the pro-
ceeding, the Recorder was associated with Judge
Lynch.
   The commitment shows that she was convicted of
being “<i>a vagrant, viz: an idle person and a common
prostitute, who, not having visible means to maintain
herself, lives without lawful employment</i>.” This
learned judge refers to the Revised Statutes, §1, tit.
2 of chap. 20 of part 1st, to show that “<i>all idle per-
sons who, not having visible means to maintain them-
selves, live without employment</i>,” are vagrants. Now
this had nothing to do with the question before him.
He might have as well referred to the Koran. She
had been convicted under the Statute of 1833, and
the only question was, whether the commitment
showed that. Now he says, “<i>it is obvious that the
offence charged is made up partly of a charge under
one and partly under the other of those laws</i>.” With
all due deference to the accurate discrimination of
the Judge, no such thing is obvious. It is true that
every common prostitute who supports herself by
the wages of her sin, is an “idle person, not having
visible means to maintain herself, and lives without
(<i>lawful</i>) employment;” but it is not true that every
idle person within this last description is a common
prostitute.
   The attempt here at mystification is so palpable,
that we pass on to other parts of this learned deci-
sion.
   It appears that the District Attorney had given this
case some attention, and puzzled the Judge with the
maxim, “<u title="“What is useful is not vitiated by the useless.”">utile per inutile non vitiatur</u>.” To rid
himself of its application, he attempts to render the
effort ludicrous. He then supposes that officer pro-
posed to strike from the commitment all the words
that describe the offence, so as to leave an absurdity.
Take the law and commitment, and compare them.
Strike out from the commitment the words italicised,
as proposed by the District Attorney, and compared
with the law, and it stands thus:—
<m9><table style="white-space:normal"><tr><td align=center valign=top>C<small>OMMITMENT</small>.</td><td align=center>L<small>AW</small>.</td></tr>
<tr style="white-space:pre"><td style="padding-right:1em">“A vagrant, viz: <i>an idle
person and</i> a common pros-
titute who, not having <i>visi-
ble</i> means to maintain her-
self, lives without lawful
employment.”</td><td valign=top>“All common prostitutes
who have no lawful em-
ployment whereby to main-
tain themselves, are va-
grants.”</td></tr></table></m9>
   Now what would this learned Theban have?
The words here proposed to be stricken out, would
not vary the conviction; to say that a vagrant is an
idle person, does not weaken the charge—nor does
it make it different—he not only says that she is a
vagrant, but he says that she is of the class of com-
mon prostitutes; and is not only so, but has no visi-
ble means to maintain herself, and lives without
lawful employment. The clear manner in which
the proposition was put by the District Attorney, is
here so apparent, that his honor stands convicted of
a vain and puerile attempt to get rid of the applica-
tion of a clear rule of law. That the useful is not
vitiated by the useless, is here so clear, that “he
who runs, may read it.” The rule of law, as well as
of common sense, in relation to commitments, is,
that it shall contain a clear but succinct statement
of the offence. A more gross and palpable miscon-
struction of plain English has not been perpetrated
within our recollection.
  We now come to the cream of this opinion.
Hear it, oh! ye goddesses—publish it at the “Five
Points,” tell it at the “Hook.” “Now,” says the
learned judge, “a common prostitute, who lives
without employment, but who <i>has</i> means to main-
tain herself, is clearly not within the statute.” Illu-
minate your houses, and build bon-fires, for this
legal grant. Judge Lynch has decided that all of
you, aye, all of you who <i>have</i> means (no matter
how acquired) to maintain yourselves, have the
freedom of the city.
   The remainder of this opinion will be the subject
of a future notice.

   T<small>HE</small> M<small>ARY</small> R<small>OGERS</small> M<small>YSTERY</small>.—Yesterday morning
his Honor the Mayor sent to the police office for the
papers, affidavits, examinations, <i><u>et cetra</u></i>, which had
been taken before the Police Magistrates, for the
purpose of recommencing the investigation himself,
and putting his veto on the immediate publication of
such testimony as might be collected—unless some-
thing positive or definite could be arrived at, or some
person so far implicated that his detention became
an imperative duty. We saw his Honor at the close
of business, and he informed us that he had taken
some testimony, but that it did not clear up the mys-
tery, although it had tended to relieve his mind of a
suspicion he had entertained of some one individual,
who, his Honor did not say.
   The probabilities of Mary Rogers having commit-
ted suicide have been much discussed in well inform-
ed quarters, and by official persons, who had oppor-
tunities of seeing the remains after the exhumation.
The Coroner, Dr. Archer, thinks the post mortem
examination not sufficiently minute or critical to de-
cide the point, and he is fortified in his opinion by
the fact, that every dead body found in the rivers ad-
jacent to this city appears at first sight to have died
from violence. Then it is said that her family were
very poor, the furniture of the house had just been
sold for rent, the boarders had all left, and she had
no prospect but that of marrying a man, said to be—
we know on what authority—a very dissipated
character.
   On the presumption of her murder, we have the
positive opinion of the Hoboken physicians at the in-
quest. The fact that she was of cheerful disposi-
tion, and not ignorant of the ways of the world, and
had been occupied as sales woman in a cigar shop,
by which occupation she had formerly supported her-
self and mother. The absence of her finger rings, if
she had any, we do not think a fact bearing either
way, for every body knows, that a finger immersed
in water will diminish in bulk. They may have been
lost in the water, or not have been in her possession
on the fatal Sunday. We are yet inclined to think
that she was ruthlessly and barbarously ravished and
murdered. That it was done in this city by some of
the soaplocks or volunteer fire rowdies, and who ei-
ther by force or fraud got her into some of the En-
gine houses adjacent to the North River, kept her
there all day, and at night, during the pelting of that
pitiless storm, they consigned her body to the North
River—either alive or dead. Two watchmen have
been found, and can be forthcoming at any time, who
will swear that they heard an awful groaning that
stormy night at the foot of Harrison street, N. R.—
They say they went to the spot, but beyond a sort of
gurgling, which might be the rain which was descend-
ing in torrents, and might have been the death strug-
gle of that neglected girl, they could neither see nor
hear <u>ought</u>.
   An Evening paper calls on the authorities for the
deliverance of <u>Kewkirh</u> the sailor, and the arrest of
Daniel Payne. This man's conduct has been singu-
larly unfeeling, and especially unlove like, but is there
not something equally mysterious in the reported be-
havior of <u>Cromelin</u>, and the lost girl? He admits
that she called on him, and wished him to see her
mother, and his friend swears that on the day before
this lost girl disappeared, <i>he saw the name of Miss Ro-
gers written on Mr. <u>Cromelin</u>'s slate, and also saw a
rose put in the key hole of his room at the same time</i>. If
she called on Saturday, may she not have called on
Sunday? Will his Honor the Mayor have this point
cleared up.

   C<small>ASE OF</small> M<small>ISS</small> R<small>OGERS</small>.—<u>Phe</u> Police are still ac-
tively engaged in endeavoring to <u title="ferret">ferrit</u> out the au-
thors of the horrid murder of this once lovely
young lady, but we regret to state, that as yet their
efforts have been of little apparent avail. Numer-
ous arrests have been made at both the Lower and
Upper <u>Poliice</u> Offices, and every person upon whom
the remotest suspicion has fallen, or those who
in any way were supposed to be able to state any
particulars concerning her, after her mysterious
disappearance, have been called before the Mayor
or the Police Magistrates, to detail under oath the
little they knew. The Mayor, Magistrates and
officers, notwithstanding all that their revilers may
assert to the contrary, have exhibited a commen-
dable zeal and unflagging industry, in seeking after
evidence and bringing before them persons and
parties to elicit information that would shed, if
possible, a ray of light on this dark and bloody
tragedy. It is deemed proper, by the authorities
having this matter in charge, to withhold the affi-
davits hereafter taken on this subject, from the
public, until the measures in train for the detec-
tion and arrest of the guilty parties are matured,
and the cruel culprits are within the grasp of jus-
tice. Hope of discovery brightens continually, and
it is not too much to predict, that the guilty, who-
ever they may be, will ere long be made known,
and that their “sin will find them out.” The be-
lief meanwhile increases that the murder was per-
petrated in some of the numerous dens of depravi-
ty in this city, and not in the neighborhood where
her lifeless body was found.—<i>Express</i>.

<h2>A Girl & 6 Men in a Boat;
Not Mary, Not Injured</h2>

================================================================
<d>[Col.1]</d>
   T<small>HE LATE MURDER</small>, of the “beautiful cigar girl,”
is still the subject of great excitement in N. York.—
No clue, has been, as yet, discovered, by which the
perpetrators can be discovered. The Evening Tattler
of that city, gives the communication of an anony-
mous correspondent, who says, that on the day which
is supposed to be the one, Miss Rogers was murder-
ed, he saw a boat land at Hoboken with a well dressed
girl and six men cross from N. Y.,—that a short time
after, another boat with three men, came from the
city, and made enquiry of two gentlemen, who wit-
nessed the crossing of the first boat, whether a girl
had been that way, and whether any force had been
used to detain her, &c. This is the substance of the
<u title="Tattler">Tatler</u> statement, and we think it carries improbability
on the face of it. It is no wise likely that six men
would decoy a young girl from her home in open day
light, to a place so public as Hoboken either for pur-
poses of revenge or violation. As base as the human
heart sometimes prove itself to be it can offer no <i>mo-
tive</i> why so dreadful a secret should be placed in the
keeping of so many individuals. If revenge, or dis-
honor was the object, one or two villains could attain
their end, as well as six, without half the risk of
detection. Again; it is improbable that Miss Rogers
would voluntarily accompany six men under the cir-
cumstances as related. If being in the boat was not
her own choice, these two gentlemen would have had
their attention called to it, as well as the hundreds of
people, who are continually wandering about Hobo-
ken and its neighborhood. Besides, the story is in-
credible from the fact as stated, that the second boat
was but a very short time behind the first; and they
immediately started in pursuit on the run. If the
three men in the last boat were friends, pursuing the
girl for protection, it is almost impossible that an
outrage or a murder could have been committed, with-
out their knowledge. If they were of the same gang
(which is alike improbable) why were they left behind,
only to add to the danger of detection. Our opinion
is, that the statement, so far as regards the murdered
girl, is inconsistent and improbable. If an All Wise
Providence should ever bring this foul murder to light,
we believe it will prove to be the work of but <small>ONE</small>
man.

   Since the above was in type, we gather the follow-
ing additional information, which is corroborative of
our opinion above. We think the probability stronger
that she was both violated and murdered in the city of
New York.

   In reference to the account published yesterday, of
a young woman having been taken out of a boat on
the river, by a party of six men from another boat, who
then rowed swiftly to the Hoboken shore and there
landed, with the girl,—the N. Y. Com. Adv. of Wed-
nesday, says “it has been ascertained—so we are in-
formed—that the young woman was not Miss Rogers,
and that no injury was done to her.”
   The Com. Adv. says further—“There is no evi-
dence that we know of, that she went to Hoboken at
all on that fatal Sunday, and many are of opinion that
the murder was committed either in this city or upon
the river, in a boat. Yet, on the other hand, we know
that information, has been given to the police of a
<d>[Col.2]</d>
discovery upon the Jersey shore which perhaps may
indicate the spot where the atrocious deed was perpe-
trated.”
   As far as we have heard (says the N. Y. Sun) the
mystery is just as far from being in a train for dissipa-
tion, as it ever was—notwithstanding the thousand ru-
mors that have found their way to the public.

			POLICE REFORM.
   We believe there is not and hardly can be a difference of
opinion among our citizens on this point, that the Police Sys-
tem of New-York is deplorably defective and needs immedi-
ate, energetic Reform. We cast no censure here upon indi-
viduals; we insist only on the palpable truth that the exist-
ing system is vicious and must be reformed. A shocking
murder has recently been committed in our City or vicinity,
probably in daylight, and at the end of the third week the
murderers remain wholly unsuspected! Four days after the
murder had been committed, two days after the body had
been found, our authorities and officers did not even know
that a murder had been committed!—Now they are hard at
work on a cold scent to trace out the offenders and bring
them to justice, but <i>they can only discharge their public du-
ties at the sacrifice of their private interests</i>. Some of our
best officers have been on the alert night and day for two
weeks, with a certainty that they receive not one farthing,
unless from private liberality, for their arduous and not im-
probably dangerous services. Is this right? Can we blame
the officer who, on learning that a great crime against human
life has been committed and another against individual pro-
perty, starts on the track of the latter where a reward is
offered, and leaves the former where there is none? Do we
not drive him to this course? How else can he support his
family? And is not the system—to make short work of it
—calculated to give impunity to <u>violaters</u> and murderers?
   —We throw out these suggestions as introductory to the
following Plan for the Organization of a more efficient Police
by a well known and respected citizen, whose experience in
such matters entitle him to command attention. He pro-
poses—

safety; but for the arrest of murderers, highway robbers,
burglars, actual counterfeiters, singly or in gangs, I would
have them liberally paid out of the public treasury; and to
reimburse the treasury, I would assess all stolen or robbed
property which should be discovered and secured by the offi-
cers. This would, I believe, secure a fidelity and vigilance
in their department that would prove a terror to evil-doers
and a shield to the public.

		<m8>Reported for the Courier & Enquirer.</m8>
		POLICE—Saturday and Sunday.
   <i>The case of Mary C. Rogers</i>.—We are pleased to
be able to state, that at length a clue has beyond all
doubt or cavil been discovered, which will lead to
the detection of the perpetrators of this dreadful out-
rage. All the affidavits and examinations heretofore
taken, have no bearing whatever on the case, and
even the mother of the unfortunate deceased has
confessed, that the recent discovery is the only one
that can shed light upon the fate of her daughter.
   The Reporter is not at liberty to state all that has
been told to him on the subject, but he is authorised
to say, that officers are now in pursuit of a man, who
was seen at Hoboken with Miss R. on the afternoon
of the 25th of July, (the day she was murdered,) and
that he was heard quarrelling with her. The investi-
gation has been followed up with the most scrupulous
minuteness, so as to leave scarce a shade of doubt as
to his guilt, by the gentleman to whom the commu-
nity owes the arrest of the most notorious scoundrel
that ever escaped the gallows, and he is entirely con-
vinced that the person now sought for is the guilty
party. He has the best wishes of the whole commu-
nity for his success in this outrageous affair.

   As if two outrages of this kind were not enough for
one life time, we have already to record two others,
and although unlike the case of Mary C. Rogers,
death did not terminate the outrage, perhaps even that<!-- Poorly visible parts are from Albany-Evening-Journal-1841-08-17 -->
would have been preferable to the treatment the un-
fortunate victims received.
   On Thursday evening last, a gentleman accompa-
nied by his wife and daughter, the latter aged about
18 years, engaged a small boat, in which were four
men, in the upper part of the city, to take them to a
spot near Williamsburg—on landing the party left
the boat, but after they had proceeded a short dis-
tance, the daughter discovering she had left her para-
sol in the boat, went back to get it, her parents
continuing on their walk. When she reached the
boat she saw the parasol in the stern-sheets, where
she had been sitting, and stepped in to get it, when
the ruffians in charge of the boat, pushed from the
shore and pulled into the middle of the stream, where
they accomplished their hellish designs—they then
rowed to the New York side, and left the poor girl
on the dock here, more dead than alive. We believe
that this case has not been made known to the autho-
rities here, but surely if it were it could not be diffi-
<d>[Col.2]</d>
cult to detect these scoundrels. We hope that no
motives of delicacy will prevent the making of the
complaint. [The above case we have from a gentle-
man in Brooklyn.]
   The other case is that of a young lady, who was
walking with some female friends in the woods, near
the shot tower on this Island. She got separated
from them in some measure, and was met by four
ruffians who took her into a more secluded spot, and
there brutally treated her. Only one of the villains
is known, but his arrest is certain, and we sincerely
trust that if ever brought to trial such punishment
may be meted out to him as will forever check the
perpetration of these outrages, so shocking to every
feeling of our nature.

   The Murder of Miss Rogers, of your city, is a truly
melancholy event; and what are your city authori-
ties doing to ferret out the perpetrators of this un-
heard of outrage? It strikes me that if your judges
would attach a little more importance to the legiti-
mate performance of their duties, and a little less to
the procurement of indictments against certain news-
papers, public justice and the cause of humanity
would be more properly subserved. You may de-
pend on it that Governor Seward will offer a re-
ward, and then the murder will out, not before.
Your officers will do nothing effectual till they see
they are to make money by it. The absence of the
Governor, I doubt not, is the reason that a reward
has not been promptly offered.<f>

		<b>The Mary Rogers Mystery.</b>
   This dreadful deed seems to be shrouded in as
much mystery, as on the day we first called public
attention to the details of a crime which, if left un-
discovered, must fix an indelible stain on the charac-
ter of this city.
   His Honor the Mayor has taken the matter in
hand, and from his untiring energy, united with the
labors of the Committee of citizens, we yet hope,
that the miscreants may be brought to justice. His
Honor has already dissipated the absurd notion,
which we alluded to on Saturday, of the girl having
committed suicide. The testimony of Dr. Cook on
the inquest, who has been re-examined, completely
settles that point. From the careful <i>post mortem</i>
examination which the Doctor made, he is confi-
dent that Mary Rogers was brutally violated by six,
or possibly, eight ruffians; of that fact, he had ocu-
lar proof, but which is unfit for publication. He
also testifies to another important fact, viz: that there
were marks of the pressure of fingers and thumbs
about the throat and in the region of the jugular
vein, which renders it highly probable that this poor
girl died while in the brutal and beastly embraces
of one of her murderers. There were also marks
as of a severe pressure from some hard substance
across the loins and shoulders, which renders it pro-
bable that her horrible violation was effected in
some stable or out-house, from whence the body
was then carried to the North River and thrown in
for the purpose of hiding this double crime forever
from the eye of the world.
   Now these are facts clearly ascertained, and what
is the conclusion we must draw therefrom? why,
that the girl was taken by a gang of soaplocks or
gamblers, who may perhaps have had the deed in
contemplation for weeks or months, and who have
ere now fled the city. From her connection with
Anderson's cigar store and the proximity of that es-
tablishment to that resort of gamblers, blacklegs,
soaplocks and loafers, known as “Head Quarters,” it
is highly probable that the crime was perpetrated by
some of that lawless fraternity, who make this city
their home in the spring and fall, and who migrate
from city to city to spread the poison of their arts
among the young men and to ensnare the virtue of
all the women who may fall in their way.
   Every city in the Union should, therefore, be
searched and the magistracy and police of every
town and village be put on the alert for the purpose
of bringing these offenders to justice.
   Again, it is known that these bands of gamblers,
are wealthy, and that they are the pricipal support-
ers of the assignation houses of this and other cities,
and of certain other public houses where high play
is winked at, ought not all the keepers of such pla-
ces to be examined, in order to ascertain, if possible
what gamblers were in the city on the day this
crime was committed, and to ferret out the where-
abouts of those who left about that time, as also of
those who have since been missing from their usual
haunts of vies and dissipation. If measures of this
kind are adopted—and that too speedily—the strong
arm of justice may yet have these blood thirsty vil-
lains within her grasp, and innocent blood no long-
er cry from the ground for vengeance.
   Other inquiries must also be set on foot—a free
pardon might be offered to any one who would con-
fess—and if necessary, the Police must scatter them-
selves all round this city and its environs, until they
do discover some trace or get hold of some clue,
which may lead to the satisfying of the public mind.
There is a growing feeling of the inefficiency of our
Police abroad—and public opinion, will raise a fear-
ful outcry against them if these murderers remain
undiscovered; and it will be too a deep stain on our
moral escutcheon, and one which will remain as an
eternal blot on our social, moral and political sys-
tem, which no time can efface. Foreigners will
point the finger of scorn at us, and we shall be cited
as a community where ravishers and murderers are
allowed to commit deeds of blood with impunity.
   The following from our reporter contains the latest
particulars of this tragedy:—
   Notwithstanding the many and confident rumors
that a man was in custody at the Upper Police, on
whom a strong suspicion of guilt rests, we can safe-
ly assure our readers that up to a late hour last night
no arrest has been effected. Justice Taylor has ta-
ken testimony which tends to fix the guilt of having
been seen with a female at Hoboken on the fatal
Sunday, answering the description of Mary Rogers,
on a particular individual who can be identified.—
That person has left the city. An officer with the
witness who is to identify him has been despatched,
with orders to spare neither time, trouble, nor ex-
pense, in order to effect his arrest. The Justice says
that this testimony taken before him, goes to fix
positively his interview with Mary Rogers at Hobo-
ken so late as 6 o'clock at night on the Sunday, and
that this witness has identified the bonnet the girl
wore, and described her parasol and dress with the
most surprising accuracy. If this fellow is above
ground he must be forthcoming.
   At the Lower Police a note was received through
the post, written in a disguised hand, which ran
thus—
<m9>						A<small>UGUST 14</small>.
M<small>ESSRS</small>,—
   E. Keyser, 43 <u title="Washington">Wasnington</u> street, knows some-
thing of the murder of M. C. Rogers. Anonymous let-
ters speak truth sometimes. You would do well to ex-
amine him.</m9>
   A summons was immediately issued by Justice
Merritt, for Mr. Keyser's attendance, and he will be
had up to-day, but this, like the former letters we
alluded to last week, will most likely lead to no-
thing.
   Dr. Cook is also to be re-examined by the Mayor,
and his testimony, touching the state of the body, is of
very great importance now.

   T<small>HE</small> C<small>ASE OF</small> M<small>ARY</small> C. R<small>OGERS</small>.—We are
pleased to be able to state, that at length a clue
has beyond all doubt or cavil been discovered,
	...
for his success in this outrageous affair.—<i>Courier
& Enquirer</i>.
   <i>The Mysterious Death of Miss Rogers</i>.—The
Police of our city are still actively engaged in fer-
reting out the circumstances attending the suppos-
ed murder of the above named unfortunate girl.
A number of witnesses have been examined since
Thursday, but no clue as yet has been discovered
that will tend to implicate any known person or
persons. There are many circumstances attend-
ing this transaction that would tend strongly to
convey the belief that this girl committed suicide.
Officer Cockefair informed us yesterday, that he
had learned from the colored servant woman lately
in the employ of Mrs. Rogers, that on the Sunday
that Mary left home, her mother stated that she and
Mary had had a serious conversation relative to her
intended marriage with Payne, and that she had in
the end obtained Mary's positive promise that she
would not marry him. And also, that on the af-
ternoon of the same day Mrs. Rogers expressed
much astonishment that Mary had not returned,
and stated that she feared she would never see her
again! It is also said that when the body was
found there was not the slightest article of jewelry
on her person. This would also lead to the suppo-
sition that she had determined upon suicide before
leaving the house, and consequently had purposely
avoided taking any with her. And further, so far
as we have seen any evidence that was presented
at the time she was found, or at the partial post
mortem examination, nothing had been elicited
that would show proof positive that she was mur-
dered. We also understand that at the time she
left home she took with her a silk parasol with
scroll handle, and a shawl trimmed with black
fringe. If either of these articles has been found,
the person having them in possession would aid in
the investigation now going on at the Police, by
stating the circumstances under which they be-
came possessed of them.—<i>New Era</i>.
			——
   A<small>NOTHER</small> O<small>UTRAGE</small>.—We heard this morning
of an occurrence, which happened a day or two a-
go, which we hope for the credit of human nature
is untrue. Four men were employed to carry a
family party, consisting of a gentleman, his wife
and daughter, from New York to Williamsburgh.
They were landed safely on this side, and the party
proceeded on their way; they had not gone far,
when the young lady discovered that she had left
her parasol on board the boat. She returned to get
it—the boat was close to the shore—she stepped in-
to it, and was immediately followed by the men be-
longing to the boat. They shoved off into the riv-
er, and with a fiendishness characteristic of hell it-
self, committed a deed too shocking to mention.
The poor girl was then put on shore on the New
York side, and the inhuman brutes left her to her
misery and despair. We hear this story from re-
spectable authority; but we cannot but believe
there is some mistake.—We sincerely hope so, al-
though from recent experience, there seems to be
monsters enough in New York capable of commit-
ting any deed of blood and horror.—<i>Brooklyn

   R<small>OWDIES</small> A<small>GAIN</small>.—We are informed that, yesterday
afternoon, as a young gentleman and lady were re-
turning from a walk in the upper part of the city,
when in the 10th Avenue, above Jane street, they
were set upon by a gang of rowdies who hang around
the Greenwich and Spring street markets, and the
lady taken with violence from her companion, who
was beaten in a most cowardly manner.
   A crowd having collected, some of the bystanders
interfered and rescued both the lady and gentleman
from the hands of the brutal scoundrels; none of
whom, as far as we can learn, were apprehended. It
is time, indeed, when such occurrences take place in
broad daylight, and are suffered to pass unnoticed by our
city authorities, that public attention should be roused
and some steps taken to remedy the present ineffi-
cient state of our Police. The recent awful murder
of <i>Mary Rogers</i> is still fresh upon our minds, and
yet here is another case, which, but for a timely
rescue, might have resulted in some similar outrage.
   Something must be done, and that, too, quickly.
			———
   The Police, it is stated, are in pursuit of a man who
was seen with M<small>ARY</small> R<small>OGERS</small> at Hoboken on the fatal
day, and quarrelled with her.

   ☞ The horrible outrages upon females so thickly report-
ed in our City for a few days past cannot be traced to any re-
liable source. That alleged to have taken place upon a
young woman between this city and Williamsburg, seems
especially without foundation.

<d>[Col.3]</d>
   T<small>HE</small> M<small>URDER OF</small> M<small>ISS</small> R<small>OGERS</small>.—The Mayor and Magis-
trates of both the Upper and Lower Police Offices are yet
actively and earnestly engaged in endeavors to detect and ar-
rest the murderer or murderers of Miss Mary C. Rogers, for
murdered she assuredly was, and the idle stories that she
was the author of her own destruction cannot, for a moment,
be entertained. There is nothing as yet <i>positive</i> as to the
person who did the dreadful deed, as some of the public
journals have so vauntingly announced. It is true that sus-
picion has fallen with, perhaps, much propriety on an indi-
vidual who has been considered respectable in business and
connections; who was seen in company with the young lady
a little before six o'clock on Sunday evening, the 25th July,
in earnest conversation, but <i>not quarrelling</i> with her as has
been stated, and which individual left the City under suspi-
cious circumstances the day after the body was discovered,
and has not since returned. This person and a young fe-
male answering the description of Miss Rogers were seen
conversing as stated by two gentlemen who were strangers
to both the parties, and who can only describe their appear-
ance and dress, which correspond with those of the suspect-
ed person and the young lady. <i>No warrants</i>, however, have
been issued, but the authorities have sent an officer to a dis-
tance in pursuit of the suspected person, accompanied by
one of the gentlemen who saw them conversing, in order to
identify him when found.
   There are also collateral circumstances attendant on the
flight of the suspected individual, that combined, tend great-
ly to strengthen the suspicion of his guilt. Still there is
nothing <i>positive</i>, as the person accused when arrested may
be able to account for his absence, and may be innocent, as
persons other than himself may have subsequently to his
leaving her, seen, conversed with and violated the girl and
then destroyed her. Still the Police acted promptly in the
matter, and the result of their efforts will be known in two
or three days, of which our readers will be duly advised.
   The Police authorities are pursuing their investigations in
secret in order to prevent the guilty from becoming acquaint-
ed with the facts they elicit, and thus defeat the purposes of
the inquiry, which seems to be the object of some to do by
premature exposures, while they at the same time denounce
the authorities for the very inefficiency they assist in creating.
There is little doubt, we think, however, that an important
arrest will soon be made, that will in some measure relieve
the pressure of public anxiety on this exciting subject. Dr.
Cook of New-Jersey, and the Coroner of Hudson County,
who held the inquest, were examined yesterday before the
Mayor and confirmed the fact of her violation and murder, as
has been before stated.

   D<small>EATHS IN</small> N<small>EW</small>-Y<small>ORK</small>.—The City Inspector reports the
deaths of 30 Men, 29 Women, 67 Boys and 76 Girls—in all

of Diarrhoea, 18 of Dropsies, 9 of Dysentery, 8 of Fevers, 29

		   <b>The Mystery of Blood.</b>
   S<small>IR</small>:—It strikes me that the evidence is given in
newspapers, relative to the unfortunate Mary Ro-
gers, is extremely loose and disconnected—for in-
stance, Payne, to whom the poor girl was en-
gaged to be married, says that she knocked at
his bed room on the fatal Sunday, and said she
was going to Mrs. <u>Downings</u>—but no evidence is
given that she did actually leave her mother's house,
or that she did go to Mrs. Downing's—if she did not
go to Mrs. Downing's she must have called else-
where, and may there have been detained and mur-
dered—if she did go to Mrs. Downing's, then at
what hour did she leave to return home. These
points may already have been cleared up but it does
not so appear by any evidence yet published. Again
—a letter is published by some person, signed “T. D.
W.” stating that on the Sunday, (no hour is men-
tioned) whilst at Hoboken he saw a boat come
rapidly across from towards New-York, and a girl
and several men land from it—which boat was fol-
lowed by a second boat, from which three men lan-
ded and made enquiries respecting the party who
had landed from the first boat. The writer of that
letter mentions two young men who were standing
near to him at the time, and the Journal of Com-
merce gives the names of those young men—so far
so good—but it does not appear to have been ascer-
tained whether those young men had or had not
any acquaintance with Mary Rogers, either during
the period of her service in the cigar shop or since
—nor does it appear whether they noticed or knew
the writer of that letter, as he noticed them. Far
be it from me to cast any suspicion upon any one—
I merely notice these things now, as some proof (in
my opinion at least) of the looseness with which the
enquiries regarding this horrid murder have been
conducted—evidence to be made valuable in the
early stage of an enquiry of this sort, should be very
closely pursued. I don't see it stated either at what
hour she left her mother's, or the hour she got to
Mrs. Downing's if she did get there. Payne's evi-
dence is very inconclusive and unsatisfactory on
many points—he fancied the omnibuses run on Sun-
days, and because it rained he would not go and
meet her to whom he was engaged to be married—
and when her body was found, never went to see
it! Will you, if you think it worth while, point out
these things, for really there is a horrible mystery

suppress all that portion of it, the publication of
which would be calculated to defeat the ends of pub-
lic justice. Nevertheless, there is so much in his
testimony, calculated to clear up all doubts about the
manner of this poor girl's death, and the brutal vio-
lence she endured previous to being murdered, and
the testimony of Dr. Cook is so clear and positive
upon these points, that we fell a publication of those
portions of his evidence is due to an enquiring and
anxious public, who desire to be fully informed on
all those matters. Still, there are many details,
(medical and scientific,) in this portion of his evi-
dence, of so delicate a nature that they cannot be al-
lowed to meet the public eye through the columns
of a newspaper. These, therefore, we also sup-
press. From what we give below, however, the
public will perceive that their sympathies have not
been ill bestowed.<a id="Herald-1841-08-17-2-Dr-Cook"></a>
		E<small>XAMINATION OF</small> D<small>R</small>. C<small>OOK</small>.
   <i>Mayor</i>—Dr. Cook, you examined the body of Ma-
ry Rogers after death?
   <i>Dr. Cook</i>—I did.
   <i>Mayor</i>—Did you find marks of violence upon her
person, sufficient to cause death?
   <i>Dr. C.</i>—I certainly should say there were.
   <i>Mayor</i>—Were they produced by the brutal viola-
tion of her person or otherwise?
   <i>Dr. C.</i>—I think that she fainted; and that before
she recovered, her murderers tied a piece of fine
lace trimming, tight round her neck, which prevented
her breathing again.
   <i>Mayor</i>—Did you ascertain that she had not been
killed by being smothered?
   <i>Dr. C.</i>—I did for all practical purposes.
   <i>Mayor</i>—Did you ascertain whether she had been
drugged or not?
   <i>Dr. C.</i>—At the time she was found and under the
circumstances, it would have been impossible to
have distinctly ascertained that point. The ablest
writers have discussed and settled that subject.
   <i>Mayor</i>—Was her chemise torn and bound round
her waist, as had been stated by some?
   <i>Dr. C.</i>—Not her chemise, sir, but other parts of
her dress, which I will afterwards describe.
   <i>Mayor</i>—Go on, sir, and describe the state in which
you found the body.
   <i>Dr. C.</i>—It was found about 300 yards from the
shore, as has been stated, a rope was placed round
it by those who found it, and towed to the shore.—
The face when I examined it was suffused with
blood—bruised blood. There was frothy blood still
issuing from the mouth, but no foam, which issues
from the mouth of persons who die by drowning.
   <i>Mayor</i>—Are you firmly of opinion that her death
was not occasioned by drowning.
   <i>Dr. C.</i>—Most decidedly. Her face was swollen,
the veins were highly distended. If she had been
drowned there would not have been those particular
appearances that I found in the veins. The blood
was so much coagulated that it was with difficulty I
could get it to follow the lancet at all. If she had
been drowned the discoloration would have been in
the cellular tissue and not in the veins. There was
an <u title="ecchymose (bruise)">echymose</u> mark about the size and shape of a
man's thumb on the right side of the neck, near the
jugular vein, and two or three <u>echymose</u> marks on
the left side resembling in shape a man's fingers,
which led me to believe she had been throttled and
partially choked by a man's hand. Both arms were
bent over on the chest; and were so tight and stiff
that we had to use some force to straighten them.—
The right hand was clenched, and the left hand was
partially open, but rigid.
   <i>Mayor</i>—What in your opinion was that position
of the hands occasioned by?
   <i>Dr. C.</i>—It might have been, and did appear as if
the wrists had been tied together, and as if she had
raised her hands to try to tear something from off
her mouth and neck, which was choking and
strangling her. The fact of her arms being in that
bent position, also further convinces me that she
was not drowned. For I have attended 16 or 17
cases of deaths by drowning, and invariable found
that the arms were extended.
   <i>Mayor</i>—What other marks did you see?
   <i>Dr. C.</i>—There was excoriation of the left wrist
in the form of two circles around it, as if a rope had
been tied around it once or twice; the right wrist
was also excoriated, but only on the upper side; this
further confirmed me in the belief that the wrists
had been tied together, therefore the under part of
the right wrist was not excoriated. There was also
a slight excoriation of the middle metacarpal bone
on the right wrist. All this excoriation was no doubt
done by a cord.
   <i>Mayor</i>—Might it not have been done by a man's
hands grasping her wrists and she struggling to get
her hands free?
   Dr. Cook then took hold of the Mayor's wrist, and
explained to him that this could not be possible, be-
cause, in any such a case, the excoriation would
only be partial, and in spots, and could not be in a
complete circle. The hands had been tied, proba-
bly, while the body was violated, and untied before
she was thrown into the water.
   <i>Mayor</i>—Were there any marks upon the back?
   <i>Dr. C.</i>—There was considerable excoriation upon
the top of the back and both shoulder bones, and
excoriation also at the bottom of the back.
   <i>Mayor</i>—How, in your opinion, was this produ-
ced?
   <i>Dr. C.</i>—I think, by the young girl struggling to
get free, while being brutally held down on her back,
to effect her violation; and, therefore, that this out-
rage was effected while she was laid down upon
some hard substance, a hard board floor, the bottom
of a <u>board</u>, or something similar. It convinces me
fully that the outrage was not effected on a bed.
   <i>Mayor</i>—Might or might not those marks and ex-
coriations have been caused by the body coming in
contact with some hard substance after death, either
in the river or elsewhere?
   <i>Dr. C.</i>—They could not. Because the coagula-
tion was in these cases in the cellular tissues.
   <i>Mayor</i>—In what state was the dress?
   <i>Dr. C.</i>—The dress was much torn in several
places. The outer dress was torn in this way: a
long slip, say a foot wide, was torn up from the bot-
tom of the frock to the waist, <i>but the piece was not
torn off</i>; it was wound three times round the waist;
and secured by a sort of hitch in the back; The
dress immediately beneath the frock, and between
the frock and upper petticoat, was made of fine mus-
lin; a piece was torn clean out of this garment, about
a foot or 18 inches in width; this piece was torn very
evenly, and with great care, commencing at the bot-
tom of the garment. This same piece was afterwards
tied round her mouth, with a hard knot at the back
part of the neck; I think this was done to smother
her cries, and that it was probably held tight round
her mouth by one of her brutal ravishers. This
same piece of muslin was found by me around
her neck, fitting loosely to the neck with the
knot remaining. Over these were tied the hat
and hat strings, the strings were tied over this
piece of muslin <i>in a slip knot; not a lady's knot</i>. In
a sailor's knot. I consider that her hat was off her
head at the time of the outrage, and that after her
violation and murder had been completed, it was
tied on.
   <i>Mayor</i>—What else did you find tied round her
neck?
   <i>Dr. C.</i>—The piece of fine lace trimming I before
spoke of. This for some time escaped my attention.
I observed a crease round the neck, but as the flesh
appeared swollen, I thought it might be a natural
crease in the neck; but passing my hand behind her
ear, I accidentally felt a small knot; and found that
a piece of lace, which I supposed to have been the
trimming of her lace collar, <i>was tied so tightly round
her neck as to have been hidden from sight</i> in the flesh
of the neck; <i>this was tied in a hard knot under the
left ear</i>. This would have strangled her.
   <i>Mayor</i>—Were there any cuts on the face or head,
or any marks thereon as though done with any blunt
or sharp instrument?
   <i>Dr. C.</i>—None whatever.
   <i>Mayor</i>—Was the body in such a state when you
first saw it that there could be no difficulty about the
recognizing of it.
   <i>Dr. C.</i>—It was; and Mr. Crommelin appeared to
recognise it immediately.
   The rest of Dr. Cook's examination is of such a
nature that it cannot be given in detail. It related,
however, to the appearances of the body, which en-
abled the doctor to state positively that the poor
girl had been brutally violated. The following,
however, in the substance of what he did say on this
subject. He said that previous to this shocking out-
rage, she had evidently been a person of chastity
and correct habits; that her person was horribly vio-
lated <i>by more than two or three persons</i>; he gave suf-
ficient reasons for coming to this conclusion. He
also stated distinctly, that he examined fully on that
point, and found that there was not the slightest
trace of pregnancy.
   Such is as full an account as can be given to-day
of this shocking scene. Under the circumstances
would it not be advisable to offer a free pardon to
any one of the accomplices who will confess.

   T<small>HE</small> C<small>ASE OF</small> M<small>ARY</small> C. R<small>OGERS</small>.—Wednes-
day afternoon, Mr. Daniel C. Payne, of 47
John-street, the young man to whom the un-
fortunate Miss Rogers was engaged in mar-
riage, went to the Police Office, at the request
of Justice Parker, to state what information
he might possess calculated to throw light
upon the mysterious disappearance and mur-
der of Miss R. The examination, which was
long and tedious elicited nothing which is
likely to lead to the detection of the murder-
ers. He states that on Sunday morning about
10 o'clock, she called at his room and stated
that she was going to her cousin's, Mrs. Down-
ing's, and should return in the evening. She
then left, apparently cheerful and lively as
usual. He did not go to see her in the evening,
as it rained, and the next morning her fami-
ly was alarmed, and he went in search of
her, but found no tidings or trace of her till
her lifeless remains were discovered in the
Hudson on the Wednesday following.
   By order of the Acting Mayor, Purdy, her
body was yesterday disinterred, in order that
the deceased might be more fully identified
by some of the witnesses; but decomposition
had already taken place, and no trace of the
once 'beautiful cigar girl' could be recognized
in the blackened and swollen features.
   There is one point in Mr. Payne's testimo-
ny which is worthy of remark. It seems he
had been searching for Miss Rogers—his be-
trothed—two or three days; yet when he was
informed on Wednesday evening that her
body had been found at Hoboken, he did not
go to see it or inquire into the matter—in fact,
it appears that he never went at all, though
he had been there inquiring for her before.—
This is odd and, should have been explained.
   The public prints seem to concur in the fact
that this unfortunate girl was amiable and vir-
tuous. She had not latterly been engaged in
Mr. Anderson's cigar store; during the period
she was in his employ, she won the good opi-
nion of him and his family, by the strict pro-
priety of her conduct. A report will be recol-
lected of her having disappeared for a time.
This it is said was the sheer invention of
a Newspaper Reporter, and, at the time,
caused the poor girl a fit of sickness. She had
for some time been boarding with her mother
who keeps a boarding-house at 126 Nassau-st.
and was 20 years of age.
<m8>   No reward for the discovery of the murderers has yet
been offered by the Governor and Mayor. A reward
of $500 has been offered by the committee appointed on
Wednesday evening, with an intimation that it will be
increased to $1000.
   The police magistrates were engaged during the past
week in the examination of a number of witnesses, but
their testimony has thrown no light upon the matter.</m8>

   The two gentlemen alluded to in the above, are
William D. Fanshaw, (nephew of Daniel Fanshaw,

and his brother-in-law, Mr Thomas. We have called
on Mr. Fanshaw, to ascertain the correctness of the

BOKEN</small>.—It is now well ascertained that unfor-
tunate young girl, named Mary Rogers, (who three
years ago, lived with Anderson, the cigar man) has
been cruelly murdered at Hoboken. Nothing of so
horrible and brutal a nature has occurred since <u>the
the</u> murder of Miss Sands, which formed the basis
of the story of Norman Leslie. The Mother of Ma-
ry kept a respectable boarding house, for the last
two years, at 126 Nassau st. Here Mary lived ever
since the house was opened, and was the main stay
of her mother. She did all the marketing, and con-
ducted herself with the utmost propriety. She has
not been at Anderson's for nearly two years. On
Sunday night, she left her mother's <u title="'purposing' in Herald">proposing</u>
to go to church with the children of her aunt, who lives
in Greenwich street. As all the family were out
of town, the aunt does not know whether she called
there or not. The next time she was heard of was
on Wednesday last, when she was found dead,—
murdered,—near the Sybil's cave, at Hoboken. It
now remains for the mayor of New York and Jer-
sey cities to do their duties.—<i>N. Y. Herald</i>.
   The Police have no trace, as yet, of the murder-
er of the ill-fated Miss Rogers at Hoboken.

the steamboat Worcester, which arrived from Nor-
wich, Ct., this morning, brought the man who is
suspected of having murdered Miss Rogers. His
name is Morse, and he was brought on in irons. He
was arrested yesterday at the Boston Post Office,
just as he was opening a letter from this city. The
letter is reported to have been from <u>Kiekuck</u>, the
sailor on board of the North Carolina, who was
examined lately before the police. It recommend-
ed Morse to change his dress, since the police were
in pursuit of him, and stated at the same time that
the writer, should he be examined again, would be
obliged to make a full disclosure. It is supposed
from this that the letter referred to the case of Miss
Rogers.

   T<small>HE</small> C<small>ASE OF</small> M. C. R<small>OGERS</small>.—The Mayor and
Police are on the alert in ferreting out the supposed
murderer or murderers of this ill-fated young woman.
   A person from this city was yesterday arrested at
Worcester, Mass., and was brought here this morn-
ing by officers from the Upper Police, on suspicion
of being implicated in the murder. The ostensible
cause of arrest was that he had abandoned his wife.
A person answering the description of this one was
last seen in the company of Mary Rogers, on the Ho-
boken shore, about 6 o'clock on Sunday evening—
and the individual arrested left this city abruptly
soon after the discovery of the murdered body.
   When taken at Worcester, he was in the act of re-
ceiving a letter from New York, advising him to shave
off his whiskers, and change his clothes, as the police
were in pursuit of him.
   No name is given, and therefore we abstain from
repeating that in general circulation, or from any of the
allusions to the outrage on the deceased, which, with
such revolting pruriency, even decent journals repeat.

   A<small>RREST OF THE</small> S<small>USPECTED</small> M<small>URDERER OF</small> M<small>ISS</small> R<small>O-
GERS</small>.—Yesterday morning Officer <u>Hillicker</u> of the Upper
Police Office arrived in this city in the steamer from Nor-
wich, having in custody a man named Joseph W. Morse,
wood-engraver, late of No. 120 Nassau st. suspected of be-
ing concerned in the murder of Miss Mary C. Rogers at Ho-
boken on Sunday evening, the 25th July. He was arrested
at West Boylston, seven miles from Worcester, Massachu-
setts, on Sunday by the officer—having been loitering about
there for several days under an assumed name. Prior to his
arrest a letter was found in the Post Office at Worcester, di-
rected to him, and written, doubtless, by one of his compan-
ions in this city, informing him of the examinations that were
progressing here, advising him to shave off his whiskers,
change his dress and alter his appearance, so as to escape
detection and arrest. This was opened and read, and tend-
ed to strengthen the suspicions against him. As soon as ar-
rested he inquired what he was arrested for, and on being
told for assault and battery on his wife, he replied, “Oh! is
that all.” On being asked where he was on Sunday, the
25th July, he first said he was at Hoboken, and on the officer
echoing the answer, he then said he meant that he was at
Staten Island. He was conveyed to the Upper Police Office
and committed. Soon after he was brought out in the pres-
ence of the Mayor and Justice Taylor, and identified by two
gentlemen as the person they saw at Hoboken at 6 o'clock
on Sunday, the 25th ult. seated on a bench and conversing
with Miss Rogers. He was also identified by others, but
was not examined touching the crime with which he stands
charged. Several witnesses, however, were examined in
the case in private, and Mr. Daniel Payne, the lover of the
girl, who said he had boarded with a Mr. Morse, an engrav-
er, in James st. but had not seen to converse with him for a
year or more—went to see and ascertain if he were the same
—the result of which did not transpire. Morse assumes
considerable apathy and composure, and maliciously insinu-
ated that the gentlemen who identified him must have been
guilty of the murder themselves, and to <u>exonorate</u> themselves
charged it upon him. He will be examined to-day at the
Upper Police before the Mayor and Justice Taylor in the
presence of the counsel he may select.
   Morse is a rather short but somewhat strongly built man,
with handsome black whiskers, very neatly and fashionably
dressed, has been exceedingly licentious in his conduct, the
companion of gamblers, and sometimes a gambler himself.—
He was a frequent inmate of the store of Mr. Anderson when
tended by Miss Rogers, and evidently knew her well. It is
well understood that, if guilty, he was not alone in the viola-
tion and murder, as the evidence at the inquest and of Dr.
Cook before the Mayor conclusively prove that more than one
were concerned.
   To discover and arrest these accomplices is now the busi-
ness and duty of the Police, though no evidence is yet ob-
tained to fix the guilt on any others. The evidence against
Morse is his being seen with the young lady in the evening
shortly before her death—his absence from home all that
night—his having left home a day after, clandestinely getting
his three trunks from his house to his office, then into a cab,
and flying from the city the day after the body was discov-
ered, and leaving his business—his changing his name when
away, and the letter written to him at Worcester by his
friend in this city, advising a change of dress, cutting off his
whiskers, &c. More, however, will doubtless be elicited to
strengthen suspicion. One of his apprentices applied yes-
terday to the Police Office to have his indentures canceled,
as his master was absent, and was astonished to find him in
prison charged with murder. To Justice Taylor, who man-
aged this business, aided by the Mayor, and to the officer
who went in pursuit, great praise is due for the judicious
manner in which they conducted the affair to a successful re-
sult. Whatever additional information is elicited we shall

		<m8>Reported for the Courier & Enquirer.</m8>
   <i>Police.—The Case of Mary C. Rogers</i>.—Officer
<u>Hilliker</u> of the Upper Police Office, arrived in town
yesterday morning, having in custody <i>Joseph W.
Morse</i>, a wood engraver of this city, whose office is
at 120 Nassau street, and who stands charged with
having participated in the murder of Mary C. Rog-
ers. The circumstances which first fixed suspicion
upon the accused, and eventually led to his arrest,
are as follows.
   On Sunday the 25th July, in the morning, he left
his home in Thompson street, saying that he was go-
ing to Hoboken. He started and did not return un-
til Monday night, when he only remained about an
hour, during which time he was in a high state of ex-
citement. While at home on Monday night, he beat
and abused his wife shamefully, and on Tuesday
morning she went before Justice Taylor and made a
complaint of his conduct, upon which he issued a
warrant for his arrest. This was given to <u>Hilliker</u> to
serve, who went to his office and not finding him in,
he left a note stating the object of his calling. The
next day, <u>Hilliker</u> went down again, and then learn-
ed that he had left the city in a very clandestine man-
ner on Tuesday afternoon, 27th July.
   After the discovery of the body of Miss Rogers,
Justice Taylor heard that two persons were in the
city, who had seen Mary at Hoboken on Sunday
afternoon with a young man, and on sending for and
examining those persons, they described Morse so
accurately, that no doubt remained of his being the
man. They also described the girl with such fidelity
that Mrs. Rogers said it must have been her daughter,
and under these circumstances Justice Taylor deter-
mined upon the arrest of Morse, as a participator in
the murder of Miss Rogers.
   <u>Hilliker</u> was accordingly despatched, armed at all
points with affidavits, &c., and proceeded first to Bos-
ton. There he could learn no trace of Morse, and
he then started for Worcester, where he found many
Morses on the hotel books but not the one he
sought for. At that place he found a letter in the
Post Office addressed to Morse, which he opened,
and which was written by a friend in this city, ad-
vising him to shave off his whiskers, and not to wear
his Panama Hat, or Prince Albert Coat, as officers
were after him who only knew him by description.
Upon making enquiries around, <u>Hilliker</u> found that
there was a young man at Holden, about 7 miles
from Worcester named Morse and he accordingly
proceeded thither, and soon had the satisfaction of
seeing the real simon pure, whom he at once arrested.
   Another circumstance, which came to the know-
ledge of the Police, the week before last, is singular
as connected with the arrest of Morse. On the Tues-
day afternoon that he left the city, a young gentle-
man of this city, who was on board the Norwich
boat, fell in with Morse on board, and in the course
of conversation he told this stranger a queer story
about his having taken a girl over to Staten Island on
Sunday, the 25th, and of the manner in which he had
treated her. The gentleman returned to New York
immediately, and hearing then for the first time of
the murder of Mary Rogers, the story told by Morse
came to his mind, and he promptly communicated it
by letter to Justice Merritt, of Hoboken, but by some
mishap the letter remained in this city four or five
days before it reached the Justice, but when it was
received, it was considered as one link in the chain
of evidence against Morse.
   On reaching the city yesterday, Morse was taken
to the upper Police Office, and was placed in a room
with ten or twelve other persons. The gentleman
who had seen him at Hoboken on the fatal Sunday,
was then shown into the room, and he immediately
singled out Morse as the man. The Mayor was im-
mediately sent for, and he together with Justice Tay-
lor, was engaged nearly all of yesterday taking testi-
mony in the case. What the nature of that testimo-
ny was is unknown to the Reporter, but he is assured
that the circumstantial evidence against Morse is very
strong indeed, and that very great efforts alone can
succeed in taking the odium from him.
   As many persons have wondered and asked what
could have induced Mary to go to Hoboken, on Sun-
day, it may as well be stated that she had frequently
been there without the knowledge of her mother or
friends. On the Sunday previous to the 25th July
she was over there, and on Wednesday preceding
that. She was there also, both times, without the
knowledge of her mother or friends, at least until she
had returned.
   As far as the Reporter has been able to ascertain,
the evidence is deemed very strong against Morse in
this matter, but there are other circumstances which
may as well be mentioned now. The letter above
mentioned, as being intercepted at Worcester, was
written by one of his apprentices, who was of course
knowing to his absence, and also to the efforts made
to arrest him. Another apprentice on Monday after-
noon went to the lower Police office to have his in-
dentures canceled, stating that his master had gone
suddenly away, and as he knew not whether he
would ever return, he desired to be free from further
service. He was directed to call yesterday morning,
which he did and then for the first time learned of
Morse's arrest and imprisonment here. The appren-
tice, who gave Morse the warning, was brought up
yesterday to be examined, but of the nature of his
testimony we are not informed.
   On the other hand it is known that Morse on Sun-
day morning went to a barber in Ann street, and ask-
ed him to go to Hoboken with him, which he pro-
mised to do, but was prevented by business. On
Monday Morse called again for him to go, and he had
with him a very large and favorite dog, which he said
he wished to exercise, but the barber would not go,
and Morse went alone. On Tuesday morning he
called once more at the barber's and said he was go-
ing to leave the city for a short time; that he had
trouble with his wife, and feared she would get out a
warrant against him, and he promised to write to him
soon. Morse may have gone off under apprehension
of trouble from his wife, and also on account of pecu-
niary difficulties.
   Thus stands the affair at present. If the girl seen
with Morse at Hoboken on Sunday was not Mary C.
Rogers, he can easily prove that. If, however, he
cannot disprove the evidence thus far given against
him, he stands a fair chance for being at least tried
for murder. He is committed for further examina-
tion which will take place this day.

	<b>The Veto Message of President Tyler.</b>
   This document, as we have elsewhere stated, we
received yesterday, by special express, before 10
o'clock in the morning, and published it in less than
an hour afterwards.
	...
   In Wall street, it was hardly possible to get one
of the speculators to talk upon the subject. John
Targee met Stephen Whitney, and said: “Well,
Steve, what do you think of the veto?” “There's
nothing in it, nothing in it, sir,” said Stephen Whit-
ney, “I don't care any thing about it.” A rich
locofoco next met another bank whig, and asked
him, “How do you like the veto?” The answer
was, “Ah! how do you do? Good morning!
Who's that man they have arrested for the murder
of Mary Rogers?” and he passed on.

		<b>The Mysterious Murder.</b>
   The publication which we made yesterday, of the
examination of Dr. Cook, of Hoboken, before the
Mayor, produced a thrill of horror throughout the
community, and has increased the intensity of the
holy excitement on the awful murder of Miss Rogers.
It far surpasses the curiosity to see the Veto Mes-
sage.
   The evidence thus far shows to every one that it
was without exception, the most horrid barbarity
that ever was perpetrated in any savage community,
to say nothing of the melancholy fact that such a
deed should have been committed in New York—in
a christian city—with legal institutions—a system of
morals and of laws—and all the elements of civiliza-
tion in full action.
   We have no doubt that our very efficient Mayor
will exert himself to the utmost, and also the police
under his authority work to the same length—but
the apathy of the police for a week after that brutal
butchery shows that we require an immediate re-
form in that branch of the public service, as well as
in the Court of Sessions.
   The sensation which all these developments have
made upon the community is most intense. All are
waking up from the dream of security, and the de-
moralized clubs of soaplocks and rowdies, which yet
hover around the city, are exciting the attention of
the people in all directions. Our system of educa-
tion, as well as that of the police, and of the admin-
istration of justice, is wrong in many essential parti-
culars. There exists no parental authority over
young men of thirteen to twenty of any kind. As-
sociating in clubs, gangs, or squads, they are as law-
less and barbarous as the savages of the Loo Choo
Islands. The hells, gaming houses, houses of ill-
fame, are permitted to exist unmolested by the judi-
cial authorities, and to corrupt and demoralize all
the youthful population of the city.
   While the community at large is justly excited on
this subject, there is also a certain portion of the
press engaged in the very suspicious business of con-
cealing all evidence, palliating all efforts to ferret
out the perpetrators, and abusing those who assist
the authorities. Do not these gamblers, blacklegs,
soaplocks, and wicked portion of youth procure this
course of policy, in order to preserve their confeder-
ates from being brought to justice? It really ap-
pears to be so—and it ought to be inquired into. At
all events, no honest man—no good citizen—no
Christian will ever relax in this holy excitement, till
the foul perpetrators be discovered and brought to
justice.
   With these remarks, we annex what <u title="further">furthur</u> par-
ticulars we can procure.
		F<small>URTHER</small> P<small>ARTICULARS</small>.
   T<small>HE YOUNG MAN</small> C<small>ARTER</small>.—We were informed
yesterday, by the father of this young man, that he
left the city on the 1st of June. Of course the inqui-
ry of a correspondent the other day, whether he was
acquainted with the girl, or any of the parties, is set
at rest.
   A<small>NOTHER</small> I<small>NQUIRY</small>.—A correspondent inquires
what is the reason that Mrs. Rogers, the mother of
the girl, has not been examined—nor the house they
resided in, been searched and also examined? We
know not—but we suppose everything will be done
that ought to be done.
   A<small>RREST OF A</small> P<small>ERSON</small> S<small>USPECTED OF THE</small> M<small>URDER OF</small>
M<small>ARY</small> R<small>OGERS</small>.—On Sunday evening officer <u>Hel-
liker</u>, of the Upper Police, arrested a man of the
name of Morse, on suspicion of having violated and
murdered Mary C. Rogers at Hoboken, on the 25th
of July. This man had been for some days staying
at Worcester, Mass., which place he left last week.
The next day a letter arrived directed to him, which
fell into the hands of the officer, who immediately
proceeded to West <u title="Boylston">Boyleston</u>, seven miles from
Worcester, where he was fortunate enough to fall
in with the man he was in pursuit of, and they both
arrived here by the steamboat Worcester yesterday
(Tuesday) morning. This person proves to be Jo-
seph W. Morse, well known as a wood engraver,
carrying on business at No. 120 Nassau street. It is
said that he had some quarrels with his wife, who
complained to the Police magistrates of this ill treat-
ment of her, and that he left the city suddenly about
the time when Mary Rogers was first missed. The
grounds on which the suspicion of his being a par-
ticipator in this horrid act of violation and murder,
have not been disclosed by the magistrates.
   Morse was taken to the Upper Police, whither
the Mayor immediately proceeded, but no examina-
tion took place, although if it had, it was to have
been <i>au sécrét</i>. We were present in the afternoon
when a member of the bar, who announced himself
as the friend, as well as <i>legal adviser</i>, of Mr. Morse,
was refused permission to see the prisoner by Jus-
tice Taylor, who said at the same time that no ex-
amination, or other procedure, would be taken un-
til this (Wednesday) morning at 10 o'clock.
   We believe that the interception of a letter at
Worcester, led to the arrest of Morse, but we do not
pretend to know the contents thereof, or whether
the letter was got hold of by the Postmaster or the
officer. One of the evening papers gave the follow-
ing as the solution of this mysterious missive:—
   “The immediate cause of the arrest of the pri-
soner, was a letter received at the Worcester post
office addressed to him. The postmaster, apprised
of the suspicion which attached to a man bearing
the name with which the letter was superscribed,
opened it. The contents were of great importance;
being in fact a warning to the individual in question,
that the police were in close pursuit of him, and that
he had better shave off his whiskers, change his
dress and shift his quarters forthwith.”
   Another <i>on dit</i> which got afloat was, that when
first spoken to by the officer, Morse asked what he
was to go to New York for?
   To which the officer replied, “On the complaint
of your wife.”
   And then Morse rejoined, “Oh! is that all.”
   And the officer should then say, “Yes, also for the
murder of Miss Rogers,” at which information Mr.
<u title="Morse">Mose</u> is said to have refused to come voluntarily un-
til threatened with a requisition from the Governor
of the State, which threat changed his resolution.
   We give these flying reports for what they are
worth, but we were assured by a gentleman who
came in the same boat, that Morse appeared calm
and collected, and that he did not manifest any of
the outward and visible signs of guilt which might
be expected from one accused of such a mass of
crime.
   A few hours must, however, clear up some of this
mystery.
   With respect to the <u title="whereabouts">whereabnots</u> of Mr. Daniel
Payne on the fatal Sunday, the following affidavit
has been made:—
<m9>   City and County of New York, the sixteenth day of
August, one thousand eight hundred and forty-one, I,
Thomas D. Bickford, do swear, that Daniel Payne was in
my house on Sunday, the twenty-fifth day of July last,
between the hours of one and two o'clock, and also be-
tween the hours of eight and nine o'clock in the even-
ing of the same day.			THOS. D. BICKFORD.
   Sworn to before me, this 16th August, 1841.
		W<small>M</small>. H. H<small>ARNED</small>, Commissioner of Deeds.</m9>
   Mr. John Payne, the brother of Mr. Daniel Payne,
has also testified, in another affidavit, that the latter
left him at the Battery at a quarter or half past 7
o'clock, for the purpose of proceeding to Bickford's.
   The affidavits of Mrs. Rogers, the mother, and
Mrs. Hayes and Mrs. Downing, the aunts of Mary,
together with several others, fully account for every
remaining hour and even half hour of the day; but
none of them explain why the betrothed and attached
friend of a beautiful girl, permits her to remain out
in that pitiless storm, without going to Mrs. Down-
ing's to see if she was safe or not.

   G<small id="Herald-1841-08-18-Gamblers">AMBLERS</small>.—Simon <u>Skohl</u>, <u>Somerville Caspar</u>, Larry
<u>Schilsky</u> and Simon Marks, four Germans, blacklegs, from
the neighborhood of Cincinnati, were arrested by Prince
John, at the corner of Centre and Anthony streets, on the
complaint of one Abraham Johnson, who charged the Ger-
mans with swindling him out of $500 at some game of
chance or other. The four gamblers were transferred to
the tombs, but in the course of the morning Marks was
taken before Judge Lynch, or some other high legal
functionary, and the whole gang liberated on bail.
   Johnson's story was that he had been victimized by this
gang at Cincinnati, and that he met them again here on
Sunday, when they gave him some drugged liquor, in
which state they induced him to play again, and got the
four hundred out of him.</f></m9>

   A<small>RREST OF THE</small> S<small>UPPOSED</small> M<small>URDERERS OF</small>
M<small>ISS</small> R<small>OGERS</small>.—The well directed efforts of the
Mayor and police authorities, prejudged, as they
have been, by the wholly uncalled-for and really
mischievous interference of busy intermeddlers,
have at last been successful in tracing out and ar-
resting two individuals, against whom suspicion
of implication in the horrible outrage upon the
person, and final murder, of Miss Rogers, rests
with a fearful degree of warrant. The names of
the persons arrested, are Joseph W. Morse, a wood
engraver, late of No. 120 Nassau street, and a man
of family, and an individual named <u>Cromeline</u>, of
whose occupation or residence, we are uninform-
ed. We learn, however, that he was formerly a
suitor of Miss Rogers, and that she was at one
time seriously attached to him; but, owing to a
quarrel which arose between them for some cause
or other, they had in a great measure become es-
tranged from each other.
   The circumstances which led to the suspicion
and arrest of these persons are in substance as fol-
lows:—A few days after the body of Miss Rogers
was found on the Hoboken shore, Mrs. Morse, the
wife of the arrested person, applied at the upper
police office for a warrant against her husband for
an assault and battery, which, she alleged, he
committed upon her on the evening of the Sun-
day on which Miss Rogers disappeared.
   In relating the circumstances attending the
cause of her complaint, Mrs. Morse stated that
her husband had been long in the habit of treat-
ing her in an improper and cruel manner; that
he was absent from home during the Sunday
in question; that he returned home late at
night, and his manner, appearance, &c. was
very confused and unusually agitated. She
questioned him as to the cause of his absence,
and singular appearance, to which he replied that
it was none of her business, applied to her a vile
epithet, and, by a blow with his fist knocked her
down. She also mentioned that she noticed the
head of his cane had become broken during his
absence. A few days afterwards—(the day after
the discovery of Miss Rogers' body)—he left home
and had not since been seen by his family; or any
of his friends, as far as his wife was aware; and
her object was to get out a warrant for his arrest
for the assault and battery, and by this means ob-
tain the aid of the police in hunting up and recov-
ering her recusant husband.
   This singular correspondence of time stated by
Mrs. Morse, together with other particulars con-
nected with her story, induced Justice Taylor, to
whom she made her complaint, to question her par-
ticularly as to the personal appearance of her hus-
band and his dress at the time; and the descrip-
tion she gave of him resembled so precisely
that of a person seen by two gentlemen of this city
in company with a young lady, at Hoboken, on
the fatal Sunday evening, and who had also re-
cognized portions of the dress found upon the per-
son of Miss Rogers as those worn by that young
lady, that Mr. Taylor believed the absence and
conduct of Morse at that time might have some
connexion with or bearing upon the murder of that
ill-fated girl. Under this impression, he advised
Mrs. Morse to take out, instead of a warrant for the
assault and battery, one for the abandonment;
and she, following his advise, such a warrant was
issued upon a suitable affidavit made by her.
   Justice Taylor then proceeded to Morse's estab-
lishment in Nassau street, and there found his ap-
prentice, whom he questioned touching the ab-
sence and whereabouts of his master, and from
whom he succeeded in drawing out the fact that
Morse was probably in or about Worcester, Mass.
To that place an officer was despatched, attended
by the gentleman who had given the informa-
tion to the police relative to what he had observed
pass between a male and female at Hoboken on
the fatal Sunday evening, who went for the pur-
pose of identifying Morse, if he was the same man.
At the post office at West Boylston, about seven
miles from Worcester, he was taken into custody
as he was in the act of receiving a letter—which
was immediately opened and found to have been
written in New York—advising him to shave off
his whiskers, and disguise himself as much as
possible, as the police were on the look-out for
him.
   <u>This letter was written by Cromeline, and was
the cause of his arrest in this city last evening</u>.—
Morse was brought to the city yesterday morning
in the steamer Worcerster, and immediately con-
veyed to the upper police office, where he was
placed in close custody.
   His Honor the Mayor and Justice Taylor were
indefatigably engaged yesterday in further <u>investi-
ogating</u> this horrible, and still in a great measure
mysterious affair; but as it is all-important to the
promotion of the ends of justice that such disclo-
sures as they may succeed in eliciting should not
be placed in the possession of others who may be,
and are believed to be, implicated in this diaboli-
cal outrage, it is not proper they should be
given to the four winds of heaven through the pub-
lic press. When we have the authority of the ef-
ficient, sagacious, and tireless public officers, who
have by their energy and perseverance succeeded
in obtaining what is believed to be the true clue to
the whole dreadful mystery, to lay further deve-
lopments and more minute particulars before the
public, we shall do so at the earliest practicable
moment.

   C<small>ASE OF</small> M<small>ARY</small> R<small>OGERS</small>.—We stated yesterday that
a man, charged with the murder of this unfortunate
girl, had been arrested and committed for examination.
The investigation of the case was resumed this morning
before the Mayor and Justice Taylor, of the Upper Po-
lice, and was conducted, of course, with great privacy.
Several new witnesses presented themselves, and their
testimony though important, we are not now at liberty
to divulge. It is enough for the present to say that there
is every prospect this bloody mystery will be cleared up
and due punishment visited upon the guilty.

   T<small>HE</small> E<small>XAMINATIONS RELATIVE TO THE</small> M<small>URDER OF</small> M<small>ISS</small>
R<small>OGERS</small>.—The Mayor and Justice Parker were yesterday
diligently engaged at the Upper Police office up to a late hour
in the afternoon in the examination of witnesses, touching the
guilt or innocence of Joseph W. Morse, suspected of the mur-
der of Miss Mary C. Rogers. A number of witnesses brought
in by the officers <u>Hilliker</u> and Parker were examined and
discharged—but as the examination was in secret, we are
unable to state as to what new facts, if any, were elicited.
Morse's examination was deferred to another day, owing to
the necessary absence, for a short time, of the Mayor. He
will probably however be examined this day. A private ex-
amination of the mother of the murdered girl, conducted with
great delicacy out of respect to her age, infirmities and afflic-
tions—was had at her residence, for the ascertainment of
certain facts. That lady is now some 70 years of age, and
is literally borne down with sorrow. It is said that some
years since her husband was blown up in a steamboat on the
Mississippi and killed; that her son, who rented the house
in Nassau-street, was some months ago knocked overboard
from a vessel in leaving this port and drowned; and now her
only solace and support, her lovely daughter, being brutally
murdered, presses grief heavily upon her heart, and drives
“the iron deep into her soul.” The state of mind to which
she has been driven by her multiplied afflictions, added to
her age and infirmities, furnish sufficient excuses for her not
visiting her daughter's grave at Hoboken, or attending at the
Police office to interest herself in the investigations going on.
The public we hope will deeply commiserate her condition,
and reserve their censures for more befitting subjects.
   There are various out-of-door rumors in relation to Morse,
which we cannot trace to any authentic source, and theretofore
withhold them from our readers. All facts we will be careful
to present, but cannot descend to fictions to gratify even a
laudable anxiety for news.

to state, has been unjustly published in some of the papers,
(not this,) as having been arrested on suspicion of his having
been concerned with J. W. Morse in the murder of Miss
Mary C. Rogers. We know Mr. <u>Crommeline</u>, who is a
highly respectable man, and know that <i>he has not been ar-
rested</i>, and that no such charge is now entertained or has
ever been brought against him. To disabuse public opinion
we make this statement, as also to remove suspicion from
the character of a worthy individual.

   <i>The case of Mary C. Rogers</i>.—Our readers will
probably recollect that the individual who first identi-
fied the body of this unfortunate girl, and who was
most instrumental in stimulating the pursuits of this
Police after her murderers, was a <u>gentlemen</u> of the
name of A<small>LFRED</small> C<small>ROMMELIN</small>, residing at No. 19 John
street. We are astonished to learn from him, that
some of the penny papers have in their reports of the
affair, most unaccountably connected his name with
that of the man now in confinement on suspicion of
having committed the murder. It no doubt must
have been by mistake; at any rate, in justice to Mr.
C<small>ROMMELIN</small>, we would say that Mr. G<small>ILBERT</small> M<small>ER-
RITT</small>, the Magistrate and Coroner of Hoboken, and
Dr. <u>C<small>OOKE</small></u>, foreman of the Coroner's Inquest held on
the body, have both borne testimony in writing to
the philanthropic exertions of Mr. C<small>ROMMELIN</small>; that
he does not know the man now in custody, and that
he has been only mixed up with the judicial proceed-
ings, from the laudable desire evinced by him, that
such an atrocious act should not be perpetrated in
this community and go unpunished.

			POLICE—Wednesday.
   <i>The case of Mary C. Rogers</i>.—The Mayor and
Justice Taylor, were engaged the whole of yesterday,
taking testimony in this exciting case, but we have
no intimation of the nature of the testimony, except
that it in nowise exculpates Morse. On the contra-
ry, every thing that has thus far been discovered
tends to confirm this suspicion of his having partici-
pated in the outrage upon Miss Rogers. It will be
several days before the testimony against Morse can
be completed, until when every thing must remain a
mystery, the Magistrates being <s>unwilling</s> to give any
thing for publication, which may <s>???????</s> with the
ends of justice. Rumors in abundance are afloat,
which, however, we <s>prefer</s> to <s>wait</s>.
   <s>We have very few new facts to communicate to-
day, but we may as well notice one or two contradic-
tory statements made by Morse. On being brought
to the upper Police Office he ?????????? any of ???

<d>[Col.3]</d>
woful <s>fibber</s> at the <s>least</s>, for on Monday night when
he returned home he told his wife that he had been
to Hoboken, and being caught in the shower, he had
staid over night. These stories do not match very
well.
   When officer <u>Hilliker</u> went to arrest him on Tues-
day morning on the complaint of his wife, he saw
the two apprentices there, one of whom told him,
that Morse was out, when in fact it has been since
ascertained, that he was then lying asleep in the
back room, having given orders to his boys to deny
him to every person except two gentlemen, whom he
named. The eldest apprentice, who wrote the letter
to him at Worcester, has been arrested, and will be
examined during the week. It is not true that Mr.
Crommelin, has been arrested on the charge of hav-
ing written a letter to Mr. Morse, nor has any other
arrest been made, except such as may be necessary
as evidence.

   Williams, the English swindler, now in prison on a
charge of defrauding Messrs. E. <s>Pricener</s> of 30 baskets
of champagne, had another complaint against him by
Messrs. Smith, of Broadway, from whom he managed
to get 44 yards of carpeting for his office in Exchange
Place, by means of his enamelled cards and brazen
impudence. He refused to answer any question up-
on the subject, and is committed for trial. He goes
on to Boston for trial, this day.

   Peter Jackson, a colored man, was arrested by
watchman Valentine, having in his possession a bag
of drugs neatly packed up. As he could give no good
account of himself, he was remanded for further ex-
amination.

   John Herrick was caught stealing a box of segars
worth $12, from the store door of T. A. & S. Hope,
corner of Chambers-street and West Broadway, and
was locked up for trial.

   S<small>HOCKING</small>.—Horace Greeley, the correspondent of
the Washington Madisonian, writes as follows of
Mary Rogers:—
<m9>   My own opinion is that she was murdered, not at Ho-
boken, but in this city; and I have a suspicion that her
death was not the result of malice or outrage, but of
some of the infernal practices to procure <i>abortion</i>, for
which our city has for some years been notorious. This
is a suspicion only; but I am confident that if her lover,
Payne, would frankly tell all he knows, it would be
easy to trace out this horrible affair.</m9>

<b>The Arrest of the supposed Murderer of Mary
			C. Rogers.</b>
   We have already stated that Mr. <u>Hilliker</u>, the offi-
cer has arrested at Holden, near Worcester, Mas-
sachusetts, Mr. Morse, the wood engraver, of 120
Nassau street, as the supposed murderer of Mary C.
Rogers.
   The Mayor and Justice Taylor were all day yes-
terday engaged in taking testimony from the Barber,
corner Theatre Alley and Beekman street, Mr. But-
ler, the engraver, Mr. Travis, a tailor, and two or
three others; all which tend to foster guilt upon
Morse.
   All the examinations were strictly private, and the
Mayor has forbidden any publication of what tran-
spired on the subject.
   The wife of Morse says, that he was not at home on
the Sunday night when Mary Rogers was murdered;
two respectable witnesses confirm her statement.
He came home on Monday night in a state of great
excitement, and beat his wife, and cleared out that
night. This led to his arrest. Justice Taylor says,
that up to this hour they have not been able to find
any one who knows <i>where Morse was on the fatal
Sunday night</i>.
   In explanation of where he spent that fatal Sun-
day, Morse says this:—
   “On Sunday, the 25th of July, I met a young lady
about noon, in Bleecker street, near <u title="Morton">Norton</u> street.—
She was dressed in black; I had met her before, and
persuaded her to go with me to Staten Island. We
went there; to the Pavilion, had some refreshments,
and I kept her mind employed till after the last boat
started. I then persuaded her to agree to pass the night
with me and to sleep in the same room. She did so;
I tried to have connexion with her in the night, but
did not succeed. On Monday morning I came to
the city with her, and left her in good friendship at
the corner of Greenwich and Barclay street. This
was ½ past 11 A. M. I have not seen her since. I
don't know her name. I think she lives in Morton
street, with her mother. I think the house where
she lives has a brass plate on the door, with cypher
letters on it. I don't know the name on it. <i>Her
name might be Mary Rogers</i>. I<small>F IT WAS</small> I <small>HAD NO
HAND IN MURDERING HER</small>! as I left her in good feeling.
Her hair was rather light. Her complexion light.
I think her <u>eye brows</u> were rather dark. She was
slender made; of very genteel appearance; rather
tall and thin; she told me she was 17 years of age;
she had a very long, delicate hand, but no rings on
her fingers. She said she was going to board at the
Seminary at Staten Island. This is all I know about
her.”
   We can only add to this that Morse appeared
cheerful up to last night. The Mayor went down
to Staten Island about 4 P.M. and had not returned
at 10 P.M. We shall have more details to-day.

   T<small>HE ARREST</small> of an individual named <u>Cromelin</u>
mentioned by us yesterday in connexion with that
of Morse, for his supposed participation in the late
dreadful tragedy at Hoboken, proves to be a mis-
take. No person by that name has been arrested,
nor, as far as now appears, was the author of the
letter putting Morse on his guard against the po-
lice. The Boston Transcript says, in reference to
that letter, that “on being opened in the presence
of Morse, it was found to be from Daniel Payne,
the intended husband of Miss Rogers.” On the
other hand, it is attributed by some of the papers
here, to an apprentice of Morse's. From the va-
riety of conflicting reports on this important point
it is most probable the author of the letter remains
unknown, or, at least, his name undivulged by the
police. Whoever may have been the author of it,
it may, after all, have been written wholly in re-
ference to the prosecution instituted by Mrs.
Morse, and without any reference whatever to
any suspicion entertained against him in the seri-
ous implication resting against him. That he was
most decidedly inclined to unlink himself from
future companionship with his wife, appears very
evident; and we do not see anything in the man-
ner of his leaving the city, and the provisions he
made for remaining away a length of time, incon-
sistent with the possibility that the purpose of
separating himself from his wife might have been
his only inducement in absenting himself.
   Among all the numerous reports relating to him
which are rumored from mouth to mouth, or have
found their way into the public prints, there are
but two which, if totally true, militate at all
against the supposition of innocence to which he is
entitled by law and common humanity, until his
guilt is established. The most serious circum-
stance alleged against him is, that he was with
Miss Rogers shortly before the evening on which
she is believed to have met her cruel fate. This
is by no manner of means conclusive that he did
not part from her before she fell into the hands of
her ravishers and murderers; or that he may not
be as perfectly innocent of participation in, or
even knowledge of, the horrors of the evening, as
any other individual. The second is a circum-
stance related in the Courier—which may or may
not be true, though, unquestionably, it was be-
lieved to be so by the author of the publica-
tion. It is stated by that paper, that on the Tues-
day afternoon that Morse left the city, a young gen-
tleman of this city who was on board the
Norwich boat, fell in with Morse on board, and in
the course of conversation Morse told this stranger
a queer story about his having taken a girl over
to Staten Island on Sunday, the 25th, and of the
manner in which he had treated her. The gentle-
man returned to New York immediately, and
hearing then for the first time of the murder of
Mary Rogers, the story told by Morse came to his
mind, and he promptly communicated it by letter
to Justice <u>Merrit</u>, of Hoboken, but by some mishap
the letter remained in this city four or five days be-
fore it reached this Justice, but when it was re-
ceived, it was considered as one link in the chain
of evidence against Morse.
   This very circumstance of being at Staten Isl-
and on the Sunday in question, is, we understand,
repeated by Morse now. In relation to his ab-
senting himself from the city, he says that he can
satisfactorily account for his doing so when the
proper time arrives, and says he was at Staten Isl-
and on the afternoon of the Sunday on which it is
said he was at Hoboken. He also endeavors to
create an impression that the men who pretend to
identify him were concerned in the murder them-
selves, and want to save themselves by accusing
him. On the other hand, the Tattler says, it is
known that Morse invited an acquaintance—a bar-
ber in Ann street—to go to Hoboken with him on
Sunday and on Monday, on both of which days
the friend declined to go. On Tuesday morning
Morse called once more at the barber's and said
he was going to leave the city for a short time;
that he had trouble with his wife and feared she
would get out a warrant against him, and he pro-
mised to write to him soon.
   On the whole, we can sift from amongst the
mass of things printed and rumored on the all ex-
citing subject, little to rely upon, and quite as lit-
tle that is very material <i>in itself</i>, if true, though
each particular may eventually prove an import-
ant link in the chain of mystery yet to be unra-
velled. The examination of Morse, which com-
menced yesterday morning, at the upper police
is strictly private. If sufficient evidence is found
against him to commit him for trial, the public will,
till then, probably be ignorant of any evidence
which may be adduced, as the Magistrates enga-
ged in the examination very properly and judi-
ciously decline showing <i>ex parte</i> versions of the
matter elicited to get before the public to the pre-
judice either of the prisoner or of public justice.

	<b>The Murder of Miss Rogers.</b>
   The body of this unfortunate girl was
yesterday, at the request of our city au-
thorities, disinterred and brought from
Jersey to this city, and deposited in the
dead house in the Park. And difficult
would it be for the most imaginative
mind to conceive a spectacle more hor-
rible or humiliating to humanity.—
There lay, what was but a few days
back, the image of its Creator, the love-
liest of his works, and the tenement of
an immortal soul, now a blackened and
decomposed mass of putrefaction, pain-
fully disgusting to sight and smell. Her
skin which had been unusually fair was
now black as that of a negro. Her
eyes so sunk in her swollen face as to
have the appearance of being violently
forced beyond the sockets, and her
mouth, which “no friendly hand had
closed in death,” was distended as wide
as the ligaments of the jaws would ad-
mit, and wore the appearance of a person
who had died from suffocation or stran-
gulation. The remainder of her person
was alike one mass of putrefaction and
corruption, on which the worms were rev-
elling at their will. And as if nothing
should be wanting to send the moral
home to men's hearts, and render it more
painfully <u title="'impressive' in Evening Post">oppressive</u>, the young man
who was to have been, in a few days,
married to her, now stood beside the
rough box in which all that remained of
her he loved was lying. Her whom but
a few days back, he had seen, “exulting
in her youth,” filled with life, hope and
animation, whom he so ardently wished
to make his wedded wife, to fold to his
bosom, to press to “his heart of hearts,”
now lay before him an inanimate mass
of matter, so hideous, horrible and offen-
sive, that the bare idea of coming in
contact with it was almost sufficient to
make the gorge rise. The remains even
of her dress, in which she had been
buried, were already so discolored and
half rotten, as to render it almost impos-
sible to be identified, and was so impreg-
nated with the effluvia from her person,
that scarcely any person would venture
to touch or examine it.
   The chief object in bringing the body
over to this city, was that it might be
identified beyond all doubt, which it ap-
pears had not been hitherto done, at least
to the satisfaction of our city authori-
ties, until yesterday. Amongst the
strangest and most mysterious circum-
stances of the murder, is perhaps the
fact that from the hour she last left her
mother's door, to the time when her body
<d>[Col.6]</d>
was found floating in the river, no trace
whatever of her has been discovered, nor
can any person be found who, for one
moment saw her, in that interim.
   Justices Parker and Merritt and Mr.
Calender, clerk of the <u title="'Police' in Evening Post">Post</u> Office, at-
tended at the dead house, for several
hours yesterday evening for the purpose
of further examining the matter, but
they were unable to elicit more than had
been already known. In the course of
the evening a coffin was procured, into
which the unfortunate girl's remains
were removed from the rough box in
which they had been buried, and they
still remain in the dead house in the
Park.—<i>N. Y. Journal of Com., Aug.</i> 11.<f>

July the wife of Morse complained at the Upper
Police office that her husband had beaten her the
night before. Officer <u>Hilliker</u>, with a warrant,
went to Morse's Office, 120 Nassau street, saw his
two apprentices to the wood engraving business,
asked for Mr. Morse, and was told by the older of
the two that Morse was not in, and could not say
where he could then be found. The officer left a
note for Morse to call upon him. At that time
Morse was asleep in his back office, as since ascer-
tained. On the succeeding Thursday, the same ap-
prentice told the officer that Morse had gone out of
town, but did not know to what place.
   Mr. Ireland, who occupies the second floor of 120
Nassau street, said that Morse had taken away his
trunks on the previous Tuesday.
   On Sunday evening, the officer called upon Mrs.
Morse, who said she had not seen her husband
since Monday night, when he left his house, No.
55 <u title="Greene (below)">Green</u> street. She said that he had not treated
her well; that as far back as Christmas he had left
off sleeping at home; except occasionally, generally
staying at his office; that on Friday night he slept
at home, and continued to live with her until Sunday
morning, the 25th July. He then told her and a
woman in the house that he had engagements at
Hoboken, and was going there. She did not see
him again until half-past 10 o'clock on Monday
night. Then he had a large dog with him. The
dog was wet. Said that he had just returned from
Hoboken—had staid there over night—that he had
been caught in a shower, which had detained him
over Sunday night, and the dog had on Monday
night been in the water. Morse was tired and ex-
cited—acted very strangely and went to bed. She
went to the pump for a pitcher of water, and on
her return found him dressing himself. Some
words passed—he said he was going out. She said
she would follow him if he did. He did go out, she
followed, and at the corner of Broome and Greene
street he struck her; since which she has not seen
him. These circumstances induced a suspicion in
Mr. <u>Hilliker</u>'s mind that he knew something of the
murder. He mentioned the facts to Justice Taylor,
who concurred in opinion that Morse should be
searched for. Mr. <u>Hilliker</u> then called on the
mother of Miss Rogers, and received a description
of her daughter. The aunt of the young woman
stated that two gentlemen had seen at Hoboken,
on 25th July, between 6 and 7 o'clock in the even-
ing, a couple answering the description of Morse
and Miss Rogers as received by <u>Hilliker</u> from Mrs.
Morse and Mrs. Rogers. The officer then called on
these persons, and they made affidavits as to the
facts stated above before Justice Taylor. After this
<u>Hilliker</u>, was despatched to Boston, to which place
Morse was supposed to have gone, as his baggage
was sent to the Boston boat. It was supposed
Morse had gone to Nantucket, as his mother lived
there, but on examining the oldest apprentice, Ed-
ward Bookout, he stated under oath, that Morse had
directed him to write to him at Worcester. Mr.
<u>Hilliker</u> was too late for the Worcester line, and
proceeded to Boston, via Stonington. On Saturday
morning, 14th instant, Mr. <u>Hilliker</u> left Boston for
Worcester at 1 P. M. Arrived at 3, and immedi-
ately made arrangements with the Postmaster to
detain any letters addressed to Morse, until he
should hear from <u>Hilliker</u>.
   In a tavern at the outskirts of Worcester, <u>Hilli-
ker</u> heard of a Mr. Morse then being at Holden, 7
miles distant, who answered the description of J.
W. Morse. He then proceeded to Holden, and
soon after, about half-past nine P. M., Morse ap-
peared on the stoop, when <u>Hilliker</u> invited him to
the bar room, where one of the persons who it was
supposed had seen Morse at Hoboken, and who ac-
companied <u>Hilliker</u>, might have an opportunity to
see his features and dress. He was recognized
though his dress was changed.* On returning to
Worcester, the Postmaster produced the letter ex-
pected by Morse, which M. opened and then han-
ded to <u>Hilliker</u>.
   This letter was from the oldest apprentice, and
advised Morse to alter his dress and shave off his
whiskers, as the police was on the lookout for him.
Morse said that he was with a young girl at Staten
Island on the 25th July, but gave no name, and
said he did not know whether he could find her a-
gain. He had made a similar statement on his way
to Worcester, as appears by several affidavits. One
of the gentlemen who saw him at Hoboken, but not
the one who went on with <u>Hilliker</u>, had examined
the dress of Miss Rogers before <u>Hilliker</u> left for
Boston, and swore to it. His description tallies
with that of Mrs. Rogers. He has since seen Morse
and made affidavit as to his being the man seen
with the young woman at Hoboken. Neither of
these gentlemen knew Miss Rogers. The other
gentlemen describes the dress minutely. Another
person was told by Morse, before he left for Boston,
the same story about his having been at <i>Staten Isl-
and</i> with a young woman on the fatal Sunday, and
that he remained there until Monday.
   The evidence so far is certainly very strong a-
gainst him, and the worst feature of the whole mat-
ter is, that Morse does not demand to be examined.
It is to be hoped that all persons who saw him be-
tween Sunday and the day he left, will give the Ma-
gistrates information as early as possible.—<i>Stan-
dard</i>.
<m9>———
   * When arrested, he told <u>Hilliker</u> that he had been at Ho-
boken on the 25th July, with a young woman whom he had
met in Broadway by appointment, but next day afterwards
said he was at Staten Island not Hoboken.</m9>

   Joseph W. Morse, supposed to be one of the mur-

State a few days since, arrived at New York in the
custody of a Police officer on Tuesday, and was to
be examined the same day. He is a wood-engraver,
about 25 or 30 years of age, and like all rogues, is
said to be a very fine looking fellow. He fled from
New York the morning after Miss Rogers body was
discovered. The magistrates refuse to disclose yet
the manner in which suspicion was excited against
him. We presume the whole affair of this murder
will in some way, soon become public, revealing an
awful tale of guilt, and disclosing the most horrid
particulars.

   Nothing further of much importance has been

was examined before the New York Police, yester-

   E<small>XAMINATION IN THE</small> C<small>ASE OF</small> M<small>ISS</small> R<small>OGERS</small>.—The in-
vestigation into the case touching the murder of Miss Mary
C. Rogers was continued yesterday at the Upper Police
Office, before the Mayor and Justice Taylor, <i>in secret</i>, during
which several witnesses were examined, as also Morse, the
accused, himself. The latter having, as is understood—
(though we are not officially advised of the fact)—asserted
on Wednesday that he was not at Hoboken on Sunday, the
25th of July, and did not see Miss Rogers that day, but that
he was at Staten Island, and remained there during the
whole of Sunday night in company with <i>another</i> female,
aged about 17 years, of Morton-street,—the Mayor, late on
Wednesday afternoon, proceeded to Staten Island, and there
ascertained that a man resembling the accused had lodged
in a public house there that night, and that a genteel looking
young female was in company with him, and also lodged in
the same room with Morse. To prove the correctness or
falsity of this statement, Morse was induced to reveal the
name of the young lady, who, he said, resided in Morton-
street; and in the course of yesterday she was sought out,
found, brought to the Upper Police Office, and examined.—
She stated, as we unofficially informed, that she was
about 17 years of age—had seen Morse once before—be-
lieved him to be a single man; and that on Sunday, the 25th
of July, he met her in Bleecker-street, and persuaded her to
take an excursion with him to Staten Island; that they went
early in the afternoon, about 2 o'clock, to the Island,
where Morse contrived to while away the time with her un-
til the last boat had left, when he pressed her to stay and
lodge in the same room with him that night, which she re-
fused; but that on his threat to expose her, and on his plight-
ing his honor that he would not molest her, she consented
and did lodge in the same room with him, in separate beds;
that during the night he forfeited his pledge, and came to
her bed and proceeded to improper liberties, which she re-
sisted, and that he then proceeded to use force, but that she
successfully resisted all his efforts; that on Monday forenoon
they left the Island together and arrived in this city, when
he accompanied her as far as the corner of Barclay and
Greenwich-streets, when he left her and she returned home.
As corroborations of the statement of the young lady, as also
that of Morse in part, we understand that Messrs. <u title="John (elsewhere)">James</u>
Conner, William H. Hicks, R. <u title="Baker, Becker, Bucker (elsewhere)">Backer</u> and W. J. McKee
were examined, and all deposed that they saw Morse be-
tween 1 and 2 o'clock on Sunday afternoon, the 25th of July,
in Broadway, in company with a young lady, wending their
way towards the Battery, when one of the company, address-
ing one of the others, said, “There goes Morse with your
girl.”
   From these several confirmations of the story told by
Morse, and which go to prove an <i>alibi</i>, it is pretty clearly
established that the Police have been again deceived—that
Morse is not the man who was seen with Miss Rogers at
Hoboken, and that he is not guilty of that charge, whatever
else may be his sins. He is still, however, kept in custody,
as there are charges of assault and battery on his wife, and
of abandoning her yet against him. It is also rumored a
third charge has been or will be preferred, of the nature of
which we are not specifically advised. As Morse then had
been found to be <i>not</i> the murderer, the next question arises,
who is he? and where is he to be found? This, we appre-
hend, none, save the guilty and He who sees all things,
knows; but the Police are determined to endeavor still to
find out. The inquiry has been, thus far, confined to evi-
dence relative to the commission of the crime on <i>Sunday
evening</i>. Might it not, we ask, have been committed on
Monday, or Monday evening, or even as early as Sunday
before noon? We submit these questions for the authorities.

   ☞ Great care should be taken in calling names or impli-
cating persons in regard to the awful death of Mary C. Ro-
gers. The Sun's atrocious implication of Mr. <u>Cromeline</u>
has been paralleled by a similar misrepresentation in several
papers which speaks of “a barber in Ann-st.” as an ac-
quaintance and crony of Morse, and engaged to accompany
him to Hoboken. This is all wrong. The only barber in
Ann-st. is Mr. James Grant, a most worthy man, who knows
nothing of Morse. A barber in Beekman-st. was mentioned
in the testimony.

		POLICE—Thursday.
   <i>The case of Mary C. Rogers</i>.—We regret to state
that the outrage upon this unfortunate girl remains
as much a mystery as ever, evidence having been
yesterday adduced, proving unquestionably that
Morse had no hand in the murder of Miss Rogers,
although it was satisfactorily proved that he is a most
consummate scoundrel, and deserves, what he will
doubtless receive, the full measure of punishment,
which the law allows. Up to Wednesday night all
the testimony which had been taken at the Upper
Office on the subject, tended as far as accurate de-
scription could go, to fasten the strongest suspicion
upon him. He then, however, made a statement to
the magistrates to this effect; that he was at Staten
Island on Sunday the 25th July, in company with a
girl, whose name he did not know, but who lived in
Morton street. He also gave a minute description of
her dress, and with this information the Mayor pro-
ceeded to Staten Island, where, upon making enqui-
ry, he was satisfied that the statement of Morse was
in the main correct, and the only difficulty then was
to discover the girl, as even Morse did not know her
name or residence. This difficulty was got over yes-
terday morning, and the girl was produced before the
Mayor and Justice Taylor. She is rather a hand-
some girl, not yet 17 years of age, and appeared ter-
ribly affected in giving her statement, which was to
the following effect, and which proves her at best, a
very weak-minded girl, easily led astray. Her name
we of course suppress.
   She states that on Sunday afternoon, the 25th July,
he met her in Bleecker street, (he says by appoint-
ment, although he admits he never saw her but a few
times before,) and she was persuaded to go to Staten
Island with him. When they reached there, he ma-
naged to detain her until the last boat had left, and it
was found impossible to return to the city that night.
He then, by dint of threats that he would expose and
hold her name up to odium, and by other means, such
as might have been expected from a man like himself,
induced her to go to the hotel near the quarantine,
and stay for the night, and he promised most faithful-
ly that she should receive no harm at his hands. This
promise he violated, however, for after she had re-
tired, he used every argument he could think of, and
eventually some force, to accomplish his designs, in
which he was unsuccessful. In the morning they
returned to the city, and he left her between 10 and
11 o'clock, on the corner of Barclay and Greenwich
street.
   This is the substance of her statement, obtained
indirectly, for none of the papers have as yet been ex-
hibited to the reporters, and as there is abundance of
evidence to prove that he was with this girl on the
Sunday, 25th July, of course the accusation as to
having participated in the murder of Miss Rogers
falls to the ground. He will undoubtedly, however,
have to stand a trial for the attempt to commit a rape
upon this girl, and if convicted, there is no doubt
that he will suffer to the fullest extent of the law.
   Under these circumstances, the murder of Miss
Rogers is as great a mystery as ever, and we much
fear, that so much time has now elapsed since it
was committed, that the perpetrators will escape jus-
tice. Morse has not yet, however, been discharged
from the suspicion of murder, and will not be until
the statement of the girl is fully confirmed, to which
end the examination will be resumed this day.

   <i>Coroner's Office</i>.—The Coroner, yesterday, held an
inquest on the body of a lad aged 11 years, named
Robert Farrell, residing with his aunt at No. 42
Ridge street, who was drowned on Tuesday. He
went with other boys to the foot of <u title="Broome">Broom</u> street to
swim, and getting out of his depth, was drowned,
and his body was only recovered yesterday. Ver-
dict, accidentally drowned.
   Also, upon the body of Ambrose Morgan, aged 55,
found in the East River, near the foot of Delancey
street, having fallen into the river on Wednesday
night. He was heard shouting for help by some
persons on board the sloop Splendid, but before any
assistance could be rendered, he sank to rise no more.
Verdict, accidentally drowned.
   Also, upon an infant, the child of Mr. Robert Dun-
can, residing at No. 110 119th-street, who came to its
death by taking laudanum instead of paregoric, which
was intended and which was served out for that arti-
cle by a clerk in the drug store of Mr. Hinman, No.
145 Eighth Avenue. A witness testified to having
purchased the drug for paregoric, and administered it
to her own child, which fortunately sustained no in-
jury, and some of the same being administered to
Mr. Duncan's infant, it caused the death of the child
in a few hours. The jury returned a verdict in ac-
cordance with the above circumstances, and censured
in the most unmeasured terms the clerk who sold
the drug.
   Also, upon the body of Rebecca <u>Foohay</u>, residing
on the corner of West and <u>John</u> streets, who died of
<u title="apoplexy">apolexy</u> produced by intemperance. Verdict accor-
dingly.
   Also, upon the body of the young man, Jacob
Wirtz, who was drowned on Sunday evening last,
between 9 and 10 P. M. by falling from the Ferry
Boat, crossing from Hoboken. As the only testimo-
ny before the Coroner on this inquest, was that of a
friend to identify the body, and of the person who
picked up the body, we will state a fact connected
with the deceased, which has come to us from good
authority, and which deserves attention. A few
nights since, Wirtz was walking on the Battery
with two young ladies, to one of whom he was en-
gaged to be married, and as they were about going
out, a ruffianly fellow stepped up and remarked that
two girls was too much for one man, and that he
wanted one. Wirtz wishing to avoid any disturb-
ance, crossed over, but the ruffian followed him up,
and after abusing him struck him a violent blow.—
The watchmen and citizens have interfered and the
fellow was taken and confined in the watch house.
In the morning Wirtz made his complaint, and was
bound over to appear and prosecute the man. As it
is well known that gangs of lawless men infest the
Hoboken boats at night, would it not be worth en-
quiring if some of this fellow's friends were not on
board, and whether his falling overboard was purely
accidental? Surely some person must have been near
him when he was sitting on the rail of the boat, for
the boat was densely crowded on that occasion. We
merely throw out these suggestions for the action of
the proper authorities.

<b>The Murder of Mary C. Rogers—Further
	Particulars—Innocence of Morse.</b>
   This is one of the most extraordinary cases that
ever came before a criminal court in any country.
At the very moment that some scoundrels were rav-
ishing and murdering Mary Rogers at Hoboken or
New York, Morse was trying to seduce a girl at the
Pavilion at Staten Island.
   All our readers remember the statement we gave
yesterday, from Morse's own lips, as to where he
was on the fatal Sunday. Every word he said, and
we published, was true. The instant Mr. Hicks, of
the firm of W. & H. Hicks, Pine street, saw the
“Herald” yesterday, he went to Mr. <u title="John (elsewhere)">James</u> <u>Connor</u>,
the Type Founder, and reminded him that they had
seen Morse <i>in company with a young lady in black, on
the fatal Sunday, in Broadway, at 3 in the afternoon!</i>
   On that occasion, Mr. <u>Conner</u>, Mr. Hicks, Mr.
<u title="Baker, Backer, Bucker (elsewhere)">Becker</u>, and Mr. M'Kee the ship broker, &c. of
Wall street, were in company. The young lady is
the daughter of highly respectable widow lady,
living in Morton street. She has brothers and sis-
ters. They live on their means. We have her
name, and know her well; but it would be a
great outrage to publish the name. The above
four gentlemen met Morse and the young lady
in Broadway, between White and Walker streets,
on that Sunday, at half past three P. M. They
read the “Herald” separately, and then went to the
Upper Police, and told their story. The Mayor
detained them, and made Mr. M'Kee name the
young lady, and tell her residence. Officer <u>Hilliker</u>
was sent to the house, found her, brought her up to
the Upper Police Office, in tears. She corroborated
all Morse's statements, and when he was brought
out of the cell, she identified him as the man who
was with her from 3 P. M. on that Sunday, till 11 A.
M. on the next day, Monday morning. But we will
give part of her examination:—
   Q.—You can swear that the man here called
Morse, is the man that was with you that Sunday,
the 25th of July?
   Young Lady.—I can. He was the man.
   Q.—Where did you first meet with him that day?
   A.—In Bleecker street, near Morton.
   Q.—What hour?
   A.—The clock struck three as I left my mother's
house in the afternoon.
   Q.—Had you seen him before.
   A.—I had, and agreed to go to Staten Island.
   Q.—Which way did you go?
   A.—Up Bleecker street and down Broadway.
   Q.—Did you meet any body you knew?
   A.—I met Mr. <u>McKee</u> in Broadway.
   Q.—Did you go to Staten Island with Morse?
   A.—I did.
   Q.—What passed there?
   A.—He kept my mind occupied, and my attention
off the time until the last boat started for New
York.
   Q.—What then?
   A.—He persuaded me to stay at the Hotel; and I
did not know what was for the best, and stayed.
   Q.—Did you pass the night in the same room with
him?
   A.—I did.
   Q.—What time did you retire?
   A.—Not till near midnight.
   Q.—Did he take any liberties with you?
   A.—He kissed me and hugged me a good deal,
and he tried to persuade me to yield to his wishes;
but I resisted all night.
   Q.—Did he use any force or violence?
   A.—I can't say that he tried to use force.
   Q.—Did you lay down on the bed?
   A.—I did, for part of the night.
   Q.—Did you undress?
   A.—I did partly.
   Q.—Did you wear any night clothes?
   A.—He went down stairs to get some night clothes
for me.
   Q.—Then you laid down on the bed with him in
the night clothes?
   A.—I did.
   Q.—Did you sleep any?
   A.—I can't say I did.
   Q.—Did he not try to force you?
   A.—He tried to persuade me to consent to his wish-
es in every way; but I refused.
   Q.—He did not violate your person, then?
   A.—He did not.
   Q.—When did you return to the city?
   A.—About ten or eleven next morning.
   Q.—Have you seen him since until to-day?
   A.—I have not.
   This is the substance of this poor girl's testimony;
and she was half deluged in tears the whole time.
She is very beautiful; tall, slim, genteel, and one of
the most modest looking young ladies in the city.
   Thus Morse has proved where he was from 3
P. M., on that fatal Sunday, till 11 A. M. next day.
Mr. John Conroy, the celebrated fishing tackle ma-
ker, of Fulton street, saw him and spoke to him at
10½ A. M., on that fatal Sunday, in Ann street, near
Theatre alley. Morse has now to account for
where he was between half past 10 and half past 2
or 3 o'clock on that Sunday. We are not allowed to
say more to-night.

gives farther particulars of the dreadful murder of
three children by their own mother.
   “We understand that she commenced her bloody
work about day-break; hoping to get through with
it before her husband or her eldest children would
awake. We give such of the particulars as we can
recollect in her own words:
   “I had it all arranged the evening before; had
sharpened the axe and fixed the meat block which
stands outside the door, and laid the axe beside it;
	...
he jumped out of bed, and seizing me round the
waist, asked me what I was going to do; I told
him that I was going to hang myself; he held on to
me and screamed out for help, until our nearest

		<b>City Intelligence.</b>
   C<small>ORONER'S</small> O<small>FFICE</small>.—An inquest was held at the cor-
ner of West and Jane streets, on the body of Rebecca
<u>Foshay</u>, aged 27, a native of Belfast, Ireland. It appeared
that the deceased had been very intemperate for the last
year past, and that her death was the consequence of her
addiction to that filthy vice.
   The jury found a verdict of apoplexy, produced by in-
temperance.
   Another inquest was held at No. 3<s title="5 ?">6</s>1 Rivington street,
on the body of <u>Antoine</u> Morgan, a native of <u title="Massachusetts">Massachu-
sets</u>, aged 55, who was accidentally drowned while saw-
ing wood on board a sloop at the foot of <u title="Delancey">Delancy</u> street.
Verdict, accidental death.
   A third inquest was held at No. 42 Ridge street, on the
body of Robert Farrell, a native of this city, aged 11
years, who was drowned while bathing on Wednesday
night, at the foot of Broome street. The deceased was a
good swimmer, but subject to fits, and was seized with a
fit after he had been about ten minutes in the water. Be-
fore assistance could get to the lad from the shore, the
tide carried him under a raft of logs, where he sank.
Verdict, accidentally drowned.
   A fifth inquest was held on the body of the infant child
of Robert Duncan, residing at 110 119th street, which
died in consequence of the administering of a dose of lau-
danum by mistake, the nurse and mother thinking it to
be a dose of <u title="paregoric">paragoric</u>.
   The jury found “that the female infant came to her
death by having laudanum administered in the place of
<u>paragoric</u>, which was sold from the store of S. S. Hin-
man, 145 Eighth Avenue, in a mistake for <u>paragoric</u>, and
the jury conceive there was considerable negligence on
the part of the clerk who sold that same drug.”
   P<small>AUCITY OF</small> B<small>USINESS</small>.—Only one charge at the Lower
Police yesterday, and that was for such an unseasonable
offence, as stealing a feather bed in the dog days. The
guilty one was Ann Thompson, and she was, of course,
sent to the tombs to await the judgement of his Honor
Judge Noah.

   T<small>HE</small> H<small>OBOKEN</small> T<small>RAGEDY</small>.—The investigation
which the Mayor and Justice Taylor are indefati-
gably prosecuting at the upper police office, yes-
terday resulted in the discovery of evidence which
wholly and totally exonerates the prisoner Morse
from any participation in that horrid affair, and
established the truth of his assertion that, on the
afternoon, evening and night, of the fatal Sunday,
25th July, he was at Staten Island, in company
with another female. The witness who establish-
ed this alibi was a young girl, some 16 years of
age, of highly respectable character and connex-
ions, employed in one of the principal type <u title="= foundries">foun-
deries</u> in the vicinity of this office, and residing in
the upper part of the city. A partial acquaintance
had for some time existed between them; and ear-
ly on the afternoon of the fatal day they acciden-
tally met in the street; and Morse accosting her,
succeeded in persuading her to accompany
him on an excursion to Staten Island; and
when there, he managed to detain her until the
last boat had left, and it was impossible to return
to the city that night. He then, by dint of threat-
ening to leave her alone, to hold her name up to
odium, and by every other foul means that he
could invent, fairly compelled her to go to the ho-
tel, and he persuaded her to retire to bed, under
the most solemn promises that she should not re-
ceive any injury at his hands. During the night,
however, he got into her chamber, and used some
force in his endeavors to accomplish his rascally
purpose, in which, however, he was unsuccessful.
In the morning the young girl returned to the city
and went to her home in Morton street, and pro-
bably for fear of the consequences to herself,
would never have appeared at all, had the urgent
necessity of the case not demanded her attend-
ance.
   Morse is thus, happily for himself, relieved from
the odium and responsibility of the murder of
which he has been unjustly suspected; but has he
not, by his rascally treatment of this young girl,
subjected himself to a criminal prosecution of an-
other, and scarcely less diabolical character?—
What say you, Mr. Whiting?
   The allusion made to a barber in Ann street in
our paper of yesterday, as has having been spo-
ken to by Morse to accompany him to Hoboken,
was made on the strength of publications in oth-
er papers, which are evidently incorrect, as the
gentleman in Ann street has no acquaintance with
Morse. The person intended is, as we understand,
a barber in another street, and not the one in Ann
street.

seem, that the man arrested at Worcester, and against
whom such apparently strong <u title="circumstantial">circumstancial</u> testi-
mony was produced—as the probable murderer of
the ill-fated Mary Rogers was not at Hoboken with
her on Sunday. He has clearly proved an <i>alibi</i>, by
the testimony of a young girl with whom he went to
Staten Island that day, and remained until Monday—
as also by the evidence of the landlord in whose house
they lodged.
   Thus, then, the mystery of the murder deepens.
   Meantime, will not the decent press take a hint
from the false scent upon which, in this case, they
have opened, with such wide-mouthed and cruel
alacrity?
   Will they not see that common fairness and jus-
tice, require that names and pretended circumstances
of character, and alleged antecedent misconduct,
should not be trumpeted forth against a man arrested
only on suspicion, and who may, as in this case, be
wholly guiltless of the crime imputed.

   T<small>HE</small> E<small>XAMINATION INTO THE</small> M<small>URDER OF</small> M<small>ISS</small>
R<small>OGERS</small>.—The Mayor and Justice Taylor were en-
gaged again yesterday in secret in the examination
of witnesses touching the participancy of Joseph
W. Morse, in the murder of Miss Mary C. Rogers,
and also in the examination of Morse himself. In
some of his answers the previous day, as we are un-
officially informed, Morse stated that he was not at
Hoboken on Sunday the 25th July, and did not see
Miss Rogers that day, but that he was at Staten Isl-
and in company with a young lady of Morton street,
with whom he staid there on Sunday night, both
lodging in the same room, in different beds, &c.
To test the truth of this statement, the Mayor on
Wednesday afternoon proceeded to Staten Island,
and was informed at one of the hotels there, that a
man answering the description of Morse had staid
there all night of the 25th July, having a young lady
with him, both lodging in the same room. In ad-
dition to this, Morse having been induced in his
private examination to give the name of the young
lady in Morton street, the Mayor and Justice sought
for, found and brought her to the office, where, as
we understand, she deposed that she had seen Morse
once before—that he met her on Sunday, 25th July,
early in the afternoon, in Bleecker street, and per-
suaded her to accompany him on a pleasure excur-
sion to Staten Island, and that she went there;
and that under one pretext or another he continued
to detain her there until after the last boat
had gone, when he urged her to lodge with
him, which she refused, but that on his threaten-
ing to expose her and his promise not to mo-
lest her, she was induced at length to lodge in the
same room with him, in different beds—That du-
ring the night he approached her bed, and com-
menced taking improper liberties with her, which
she resisted, and that he then resorted to force to
effect his purpose, but that she successfully repel-
led all his efforts—That the next forenoon they left
the island, he accompanying her to this city, and
as far up Greenwich street as the corner of Barc-
lay street, where they separated, and she returned
to her home.
   In corroboration in part of this statement,
Messrs. <u title="John (elsewhere)">James</u> Conner, William H. Hicks, R. <u title="Backer, Becker, Bucker (elsewhere)">Ba-
ker</u>, and W. J. McKee, were severally examined,
and unitedly deposed, that they met Morse and a
young lady on Sunday, the 25th July, between 1
and 2 o'clock in the afternoon, in Broadway, pro-
ceeding downwards towards the Battery; and that
on seeing him, one of them remarked to the other,
“there goes Morse with your girl.” An alibi hav-
ing thus been proved—the evidence is almost ir-
resistible, that Morse, whatever may be his vices, is
guiltless at least, of the murder of Miss Rogers.—
He is, however, continued in prison, on other char-
ges, viz.:—those of assault and battery on and aban-
doning his wife, are yet unanswered—and rumor
says that a third charge is, or will be made against
him, of the nature of which we are not officially
able to speak. Who the murderer is, heaven, and
the guilty perpetrators only know.—<i>Express</i>.

Morse, who was arrested on suspicion of being the murderer
of Miss Mary C. Rogers, by proving an <i>alibi</i> has exonerated
himself from that horrid charge, and is now in custody only
to answer a charge of assault and battery on and abuse of his
wife until he can furnish bail in $500 for his appearance for
trial, it may not be improper to state the reason he assigns
for having fled from the city, and remained absent until
brought back hither on the suspicion of being a murderer.—
He states, we are informed, that he was not acquainted with
Miss Rogers, and firmly believed that the young lady with
whom he went to and staid all night at Staten Island
was no other than Miss Mary C. Rogers herself; that after
hearing of her death and the discovery of her dead body, he
thought she had destroyed herself on account of the treatment
she had experienced from him, and that he therefore fled for
fear of being brought into difficulty on her account; that he
did not discover his mistake until last Thursday morning,
when the young lady with whom he was at Staten Island was
brought to the Police Office and proved to be <i>not</i> Miss
Rogers, but the identical female he had endeavored to seduce
into a dishonorable connection at Staten Island.
   Whether this is the reason of his hegira to the East, or a
mere fiction of his own, we leave to others to determine.

		POLICE—Friday.
   The testimony in the case of Mary C. Rogers, was
brought to a close yesterday, as far as J. W. Morse
was concerned, and the result was, that he has been
discharged from the complaint of having participated
in the outrage upon this unfortunate female. He was
examined yesterday, and corroborated in the most
minute particulars, the statement of the young girl,
which we gave yesterday, but he alleges that he used
no force, but that he did endeavor by persuasion and
arguments to induce her to consent to his wishes,
in which he was unsuccessful.

   Perhaps not the least extraordinary part of this
case, is the fact, that up to Thursday morning, Morse
was laboring under the conviction that Mary C. Ro-
gers was the girl who was with him at Staten Island,
and he yesterday told the Magistrate, that he thought
up to that time, that they had been deceiving him as
to the dress of Mary Rogers. He added, that when
he was told of the body having been found, he felt
sure that it must have been that of the girl whom he
had so shamefully maltreated, and who he suspected
had committed suicide on account of his conduct to
her.
   He adds that he left the city on account of the
trouble with his wife, and his affair with the young
woman, fearing that in the latter case, she might dis-
cover who he was and bring him to punishment.—
He does not up to this hour know the name of that
young woman. In this case the matter would more
properly be the subject of a civil action, as there is
not sufficient evidence to warrant a criminal prose-
cution. The only complaint against him now is that
of his wife for the assault upon her, in which case he
is required to give bonds in $500, in default of which
he remains in prison.
   We can not conclude the mention of this affair,
without awarding to the Mayor, Justice Taylor and
Officer <u>Hilliker</u> the credit which they have deserved
for the promptness and perseverance in tracing and
following up a person, against whom such a mass of
testimony and apparently so conclusive had been
produced. We trust they will not cease their efforts
on account of their disappointment.

<b>The Murder of Mary Rogers—Examination
			of Morse.</b>
   Mr. Morse was examined yesterday, separately
from the young lady who was with him at Staten
Island, and he fully confirmed all her statements to
the most minute particular. The magistrates will
not allow his examination to be made public on the
young lady's account. Suffice it to say that the
Mayor, the District Attorney, and Justice Taylor
have given their full attention to this matter, and
have acquitted and released him of all criminal
charge in relation to Mary Rogers, or the Morton
street young lady. He never knew Mary Rogers—
he never used tobacco in any shape, and never was
at Anderson's. If the Morton street young lady
proceeds against him, her only remedy is a civil suit.
She swears he used no force.
   In justice to her, we are bound to say, that after
the steamboat left Staten Island, she tried to get
some one to bring her over in a small boat, but could
not. She then consented to go to the village hotel,
above the quarantine landing, only because Morse
solemnly promised her that she should have a sepa-
rate room, and a female of the house to sleep with
her. He did not get the female. He brought her
night clothes. She put a chair against the door, and
her parasol or umbrella, and when she took off her
clothes and laid down, she took the precaution to
wrap the sheet around her. But he came into the
room, and came to bed, but used no violence—only
persuasion. As soon as she could, she got up—
threatened to cry “murder”—he desisted, and she
sat by the window, half dressed, till daylight.
   Morse is now held only till he gets bail on the
charge of his wife.
   The Lower Police have arrested a negro, said to
know something about the murder of Mary Rogers
by a gang of negroes, and he is now in jail.

	<b>MURDER OF MISS ROGERS.</b>
   This case continues, as in justice it should, to ex-
<s>cit</s>e deep interest. The latest account of the un-
fortunate girl is in the following evidence given be-
fore Justice Parker day before yesterday. We co-
<s>py</s> from the Journal of Commerce.
   “C<small>ASE OF</small> M<small>ARY</small> C. R<small>OGERS</small>.—Daniel C. Payne,
of No. 47 John street, cork cutter, went yesterday
	...
my brother was coming off the Battery with his
children, to whom I spoke for a moment or <u title="so (in Evening Post)">two</u> and
then parted. I walked up Broadway, and when near
Ann street, noticed a storm was fast coming
up, and thinking it was too early to go to bed, I
walked up to Bickford's, in James street, and re-
mained there until nine o'clock, and then went
home and retired for the night. I was under the
<d>[Col.2]</d>
impression that the <u title="omnibuses">omnibusses</u> run on Sundays,
	...
in the morning when I arose. Mr. Crommelin al-
so informed us that the inquest had been held the
night before, which did away with the necessity
for myself or the family going to Hoboken.

   We are very much surprised to note that this
testimony is passed over by several New York
journals with the opinion that nothing important
was elicited from the witness. Now it appears to
us that very grave questions arise upon sifting the
statements of Mr. Payne, involving nothing less
than a suspicion that he has not told a perfectly rea-
sonable story. Cautiously as such a suspicion
should be mentioned, it is nevertheless right to ut-
ter it upon proper grounds. These are presented
by the New <u title="York">york</u> Star, in which we find the an-
nexed comments upon Mr. Payne's testimony.
   “Narration of Mr. Payne before the police offi-
cers, contains statements and admissions which
should lead to further scrutiny and examination.
He says <i>they were engaged to be married</i>, and he
<d>[Col.3]</d>
was a boarder in the house of her mother, where
she also had resided up to the moment she left the
house on the morning of her mysterious disappear-
ance and destruction. <i>He is the last person</i> who
saw her there on that fatal day. He says, “<i>she
came up stairs and knocked at my door</i>.” He
opened it, and found her dressed for a walk.
She said she was going to see Mrs. Downing.
He said very well, he would “<i>come for her in the
evening</i>.” The statement in an another paper is
that, he said “Very well, Mary, I will look out for
you in the evening.” If either be correct, here is
a positive engagement to meet her to whom he was
affianced, and which was not likely to be broken
under such circumstances without any reasonable
cause.
   He says that “from 11 o'clock, A. M. until 1, P.
M. he was at his brother's, or went with him to the
Dey st. Bazaar. He then walked up Broadway,
and thence to Bickford's, in James street, until 2 o'-
clock—<i>then went to Fulton street</i> and dined at
an eating house; went home about 3, and laid
down until six, P. M., when he walked to the Bat-
tery.”
   The question may be here asked: Why did he
pass his own boarding house (kept by Mary's mo-
ther) to dine at an eating house, in Fulton street,
but a block from her own residence? And again,
an important question may be suggested: From 3
to 6, when he alleges he was at the house, was he
seen by the mother or any of the family? Or was
he there without his usual intercourse with them—
for it must have been about their usual tea time.
   At 6, he says he walked to the Battery, and re-
turning, on reaching Ann street, (which is but a
few doors from his boarding house,) he saw the
storm gathering, and walked to Bickford's in James
street (a distance, perhaps, over half a mile,) and
staid there until 9 o'clock and returned and retired
for the night.
   The two hours of this awful thunder storm are
important, and his whereabouts should be most sat-
isfactorily ascertained, and so should every hour of
that melancholy day. <i>He knew where she had
gone</i>, of which <i>even her mother was ignorant</i>.
   He had promised to meet her in the evening;
he went to the Battery at the very time he should
have taken the contrary direction to fulfil his en-
gagement with her who had confided herself to him,
and at Ann street he turns off for Bickford's, when
in the same space of time he could have nearly
reached her, and thus shown a reasonable solici-
tude for her.
   In the searches he made for her, it <i>does not ap-
pear</i> that he held any <i>consultations</i> with her <i>mo-
ther or friends</i>, as to the places they might deem
proper to be searched.
   After searching for her at Harlem, Williamsburg
and Hoboken, without success, he was afterwards
“informed by Mr. Luther, of No. 90 Chambers
street that <i>Mary had been found at Hoboken,
and an inquest was to be held</i>,” but <small>HE DID NOT GO
TO</small> H<small>OBOKEN OR ATTEND THE INQUEST</small>. A Mr.
Crommelin went. And can it be that he was so
lost to all feelings of humanity—of affection for
her who was his betrothed—of a regard for the afflic-
tions of her aged, widowed mother—that he could
remain, and not rush to the spot and call down the
vengeance of Heaven upon the seducer and mur-
derer. It requires more explanation than has yet
been given.
   Is there not in the above suggestions sufficient
ground for examining this witness again and call-
ing upon him to substantiate his statements? His
conduct, according to his account was to say the
least very extraordinary from first to last, and re-
quires explanation.

   <i>Arrest of <u>Moore</u>, the supposed murderer,
of Miss Rogers</i>.—The steamer Worcester
arrived this morning, brought lo the city the
above named person. He was arrested at
West Boylston, about seven miles north of
Worcester, on <u title="Sunday">sunday</u>. He had been hover-
ing about Worcester ever since he left this
city, and was watched pretty closely by the
authorities at that place. He was taken into
custody as he was in the act of <u title="receiving">receiveing</u> a
letter—which was immediately opened and
found to have been written in New York—
advising him to shave off his whiskers, and
disguise himself as much as possible, as the
police were on the look-out for him.
   We understand that he is the person seen
in conversation with Miss Rogers, at Hobo-
ken, toward evening of Sunday the 25th
ultimo. He was then seen and recognized by
a gentleman of this city, whose name we
have, but do not think it requisite to mention;
immediately after the discovery of the body
this gentleman made inquiry and <u title="ascertained">ascetained</u>
that the prisoner had hastily left the city.
   He thereupon communicated all he knew
to the police. The apprentices of the priso-
ner were taken before the magistrates, and
from one of them it was <u title="ascertained">ascertaind</u> that he
expected a letter; the letter was watched for
and obtained, and it bore no date or place
of writing, intimations were drawn from it
that the prisoner might be found at Worces-
ter, to which place an officer was despatched,
accompanied by the gentleman above referred
to. The rest is stated above.—<i>N. Y. Com.</i>

   M<small>URDER OF</small> M<small>ISS</small> R<small>OGERS</small>.—Morse was yester-
day discharged from the accusation against him for
the murder of Miss Rogers, it having been fully es-
tablished that he was not at Hoboken on that Sun-
day. Among the circumstances not hitherto ad-
verted to, which tended to support the supposition
that Morse was that day at Hoboken, was the fact
that Morse owns a small property in the neighbor-
hood of the spot where it was supposed he was
seen with Miss Rogers, to which property he was
in the habit of making constant visits.
   So much for circumstantial evidence: which,
however strong and apparently incontrovertible as
it was in this case, is a dangerous sort of proof on
which to destroy men's characters or lives. It now
turns out, if Morse's statement can be relied on,
that he never had any acquaintance with Miss Ro-
gers, nor could he identify her from any other fe-
male in the city. Nor did he know the name of
the girl, as he has all along alleged, who so impru-
dently accompanied him to Staten Island. And
when he heard of the body of Miss Rogers having
been found in the river, he supposed that it was
Miss Rogers who had accompanied him to Staten
Island, and who felt so degraded by remaining with
him all night, that she had in consequence commit-
ted suicide by drowning herself.
   This supposition on his part shows that he must
have a tolerably correct appreciation of the feelings
of a virtuous female, in consequence of having so
indiscreetly subjected herself to insult and loss of
character; for the young lady who did accompany
him, has been so deeply affected by the occurrence,
and the consequent ordeal she was obliged to go
through at the Police Office, in being most minutely
examined as to everything which occurred between
her and Morse, that she yesterday morning pro-
cured laudanum to destroy herself, and only for an
<u title="accidental (Schenectady-Reflector-1841-08-27)">accident</u> and timely discovery of her intentions by
her family, she would probably have <u title="been at this time another victim (Schenectady-Reflector-1841-08-27)">succeeded in
her purpose</u>.
   Morse, although discharged from the complaint
against him for the murder of Miss Rogers, is still
detained in prison until he can procure unquestion-
able bail in the sum of $1000, to answer the com-
plaint of maltreating his wife.
   The Mayor and Police having been thus foiled in
their first attempt to discover the murderers, are,
if possible, exerting themselves with greater energy
to bring the authors of this horrid tragedy to light;
and the Mayor and Justice Taylor have devoted the
greater part of yesterday to his business alone.—

   M<small>ISS</small> R<small>OGERS</small>.—Nothing new, has been brought to
light, connected with the murder of this unfortunate
young lady. By the last advices, a man by the name
of Morse had been arrested, who had left the city, un-
der singular circumstances, the day after the murder.
Among the thousand rumors and stories of the day, it
is said that Morse was seen in her company on the day
of her disappearance. Morse is a married man, and
the probabilities are stronger for than against him. It
is very strange that the authorities do not offer a suit-
able reward, for the discovery of the perpetrator. The
Mayor of New York, and the Gov. of the State, are
both behind their duty in this respect.

   T<small>HE</small> M<small>ARY</small> R<small>OGERS</small> M<small>YSTERY</small>.—There have been
no further developments respecting this melancholy
tragedy, and if any individual has been arrested, his
name and all particulars in relation to him—or of
the grounds for his arrest—have been carefully veiled
from the eye of the press. The Mayor and Justice
Taylor, are said to be disappointed (!) at their not
being able to fix the guilt on Morse, that they have
determined to keep all further proceedings strictly
private. If they arrest any one on suspicion, they
will not disclose his name, nor let any one connected
with the press know what are the suspicious grounds
therefore, or the circumstantial or other testimony in
existence against him. Now this is all wrong. First,
the public have a right to know what is done by the
magistracy; and, secondly, because the publication
of the suspicious facts leads either to their confirma-
tion or refutation. As a proof of this theory, we in-
stance the case of Morse, who would at this time
stand probably committed for trial, but for the con-
travention of the magisterial edict.
   On Saturday morning, Morse was bailed by
Adams, the wood engraver, and Redfield, the stereo-
typer, in the sum of $<s title="3 ?">5</s>00 each; but by some strange
hocus pocus or other, a writ of habeas corpus was
subsequently sued out, and all the parties taken be-
fore Judge Lynch, who not only dismissed Morse,
but released his sureties. Police Justices Taylor
and Palmer were very wrathy, and also indignant,
when they heard of this procedure, and intend to
direct the District Attorney to prosecute the bail.
This course may be very proper, but it strikes us as
beginning at the wrong end, for either the order of
his Honor Judge Lynch, is legal or not. If legal,
the District Attorney will only have to show his teeth
without biting; and if it is illegal, then in would be
better to set the District Attorney to prosecute Judge
Lynch for his presumption in interfering with the
orders and decrees of the Police Magistrates. As
to prosecuting—<u title="query (16-19 centuries)">quere</u>, persecuting the bail, that's a
small business for Mr. District Attorney, and we hope
his Honor the Mayor will put his veto thereon.
   Since the above was written, we have been in-
formed, on good authority, that Mrs. Morse herself
went with the bail, before Judge Lynch, and agreed
to withdraw the complaint against Morse, a recon-
ciliation having been brought about by the inter-
vention of mutual friends. Morse is to keep clear
of Staten Island, and of young ladies in black espe-
cially, for the future. Thus ends that nine days'
wonder.

   <i>Police.—Saturday and Sunday</i>.—On Saturday
morning Joseph W. Morse having procured the re-
quisite bail for his appearance to answer the
charge of assaulting his wife, was discharged
from custody. In the afternoon he was brought be-
fore Judge Lynch on a <i>habeas corpus</i> sued out by W.
J. Haskett, Esq. his counsel, who produced before
the Judge a full satisfaction piece from Mrs. Morse,
whereupon his bail was released and he was dischar-
ged from the complaint, and the husband and wife
left the office together in the most affectionate man-
ner.
   How this consummation was effected is of course
known only to the parties most interested, but cer-
tainly very cogent arguments must have been used
with Mrs. Morse, to effect so sudden a change of
purpose, for the reporter was yesterday informed
that on Saturday morning Mrs. M. called at the of-
fice of an eminent lawyer of this city and advised
with him as to the necessary preliminaries to pro-
cure a decree of divorce from him, and she was to
call again the same afternoon at 2 o'clock. She did
not call, and soon after that hour, the legal gentle-
man had the satisfaction of seeing the husband and
wife walking home arm in arm.
   The lesson which he has received will doubtless
be of more service to him than a hundred curtain
lectures. No other arrests have been made in this
case.

   On Saturday night, about a quarter past 11 o'clock,
watchman Wm. H. Douglass, perceived a man,
named John Griffin, a cabinet maker by trade, shut-
ting up his shop in Elm, one door from Canal street.
Griffin first nailed a board across the window and
locked the door, after which he departed. The watch-
man then perceived a light in the shop, but thought
nothing was wrong, and he went on his round. Re-
turning that way in about fifteen or twenty minutes,
he perceived that the light in Griffin's shop had in-
creased, and he went up and tore off the board which
had been nailed up by Griffin. On looking in at the
window he then perceived that the premises were on
fire, whereupon he immediately gave the alarm, and
ran off to the Watch House for assistance, and by
the time he got back to the shop, the fire had been ex-
tinguished. Griffin was among the first that came to
the spot, when the alarm was raised, and he was
promptly arrested, on a charge of having fired the
premises. In extenuation of this, it may be mention-
ed, that Griffin who had all his stock and tools in the
shop, was not insured for one cent, neither was the
shop insured by the owner. It certainly looks very
suspicious against Griffin, the more so from the fact,
that when an entrance had been effected into the shop,
the shavings and rubbish were found gathered into a
heap in the centre of the shop, and were on fire. He
is at present committed for further examination.
	...
   On Saturday night, officers Colvin and Watts as-
sisted by some watchmen, and armed with a war-
rant from Justice <u>Stephens</u>, proceeded to a low den
in Anthony street, kept by a wench named Jane
Prince, where they found 27 human beings of the
very lowest and most degraded class, (among them
two white men) huddled together like pigs. The
whole posse was brought to the Watch House, and
in the morning they were disposed of in the most
summary manner, some being sent up to pick Oak-
um, as vagrants, others remanded to be tried, and the
head negress was committed for trial for keeping a
disorderly house. A few such operations as the
above would be of infinite service to that distinguish-
ed portion of the city.

   J<small>OSEPH</small> W. M<small>ORSE FULLY DISCHARGED</small>.—Morse
was brought on Saturday, on a habeas corpus,
by his counsel, W. Jay Haskett, Esq., before
Judge Lynch, at his chambers, and fully dischar-
ged from the custody of the law. There is now
but one opinion in relation to his innocence; and
all the circumstances surrounding him at the time
have been clearly explained, and leave him be-
yond suspicion in this melancholy affair. It
was at first supposed that his narration of the Sta-
ten Island affair, and its corroboration by the
young lady, was but an artful device of his wily
counsel to prove an alibi, but this proof was posi-
tively confirmed by the personal examination of
the inmates of the house on the Island, by the
Mayor himself.
   On the hearing before the Judge, Mr. Haskett
read to his honors full satisfaction piece, signed
by the wife, who, despite her wrongs, clung to
her husband with the ardor of woman's love.—
They left in company together perfectly recon-
ciled, and went home. Mrs. Morse is a fine look-
ing woman, and her conduct towards her husband,
during his imprisonment, reflects credit upon her
heart. After this providential chastisement for
his infidelity, we trust that he may become sensi-
ble of the past, and make proper reparation for his
follies. He bears the reputation of a man of in-
dustrious habits, and stands at the very head of
his profession as an artist, and we leave him with
those kind words which our Savior spoke to fal-
len man—“Go, and sin no more.”

<m9>   ☞ AT a meeting of North River Fire Engine Co. No.
27, held on Monday evening, 16th inst., the following extract
from an article in the Sunday Mercury, in relation to the
late murder of Mary C. Rogers was read to the Company:
   “With regard to the carrying away of a young female by
a boat's crew, the circumstances are thus explained by the
girl herself, in the form of an affidavit, made at the police
office. In the boat that boarded the one in which she was,
were seven young men, averaging about seventeen years of
age, who beat her companions, and forcibly took her from
the boat, landed her at Hoboken, and then took her into the
woods, where she was treated with the most brutal violence.
After the young ruffians had glutted their beastly appetites,
the poor girl was carried back to the boat, and at a late
hour in the evening landed in this city. On their braces, or
on some part of their bodies were the figures 27, signifying
that they were members of, or in some way attached to the
fire company of that number. Every person who ventures
abroad with a female, owes it to himself and to her to be
well armed. We have no preventive police, and no guardi-
ans of the peace at all<u title=".”">.</u>
   Whereupon, the following preamble and resolution were
adopted.<u>”</u>
   Whereas, the above article contains an imputation against
the members of this Company which if true, would involve
them in a transaction of the blackest infamy and disgrace—
and whereas, as good citizens, it is our duty to investigate
the circumstances which led to the imputation, and endeav-
or if possible to ferret out the villains who perpetrated this
foul act, under the insignia of our Company, and bring them
to justice. Therefore
   Resolved, That a committee of three be appointed to ex-
amine into, and investigate to the fullest extent the imputa-
tion contained in the said extract, and to spare no pains to
bring to justice the offenders, who have so wantonly com-
mitted the double outrage of villainy to an innocent female,
and to this company.
   At a subsequent meeting, held on Friday evening, the
above committee reported—
   That they had faithfully examined into the subject upon
which they were appointed, with a full estimate of its im-
portance, as well to the character of this company as to
the cause of public justice.
   That after a strict investigation amongst all the “volun-
teers,” who are in the habit of running with the Company,
as well as amongst the members, (none of the latter, how-
ever, being under 21 years of age, and therefore not an-
swerable to the imputation,) your committee have to a sat-
isfaction to report, that they are all innocent of the charge.
   During the course of the investigation your committee
have found that many persons in the vicinity of Clinton
market, totally unconnected with this company, either as
members or volunteers, or otherwise, are for causes un-
known to us, in the habit of wearing belts with the number
“27” on them, around their bodies, but it was not in the
power of this committee to ascertain who they are.
   Your committee would therefore recommend for adop-
tion the following resolution—
   Resolved, That this company, from its well known char-
acter for integrity and morality, after the investigation thus
had, appeal with confidence to the justice and magnanimity
of a generous public, to clear its members and volunteers
from any knowledge of, or participation in this horrible out-
rage.
   It was also resolved that these proceedings be published.

   T<small>HE</small> M<small>URDER OF</small> M<small>ISS</small> R<small>OGERS</small>.—The murder of this un-
fortunate young lady is still wrapped in mystery as to the
time when, the place where, and the circumstances under
which the bloody deed was done; and although suspicions
were permitted to settle on some individuals, and arrests
made and examinations instituted, with a view to fix the foul
offence on the guilty author, yet the murderer still remains
concealed from the eye of man, and <u title="Souls of deceased loved ones (Wikipedia)">the manes</u> of the mur-
dered girl remain unappeased—her blood unatoned. The
efforts of the Police, which have been unremitted, have been
continually misdirected. The persons suspected have, with-
out exception, been acquitted of the suspicions entertained
against them; and no one has been found who saw the young
lady after she left her mother's residence on the fatal day,
notwithstanding the searching inquiries that have been made.
Speculative opinions have been advanced by some that the
girl has not been murdered; that the body found was not suf-
ficiently identified as hers; and that her sudden disappearance
is owing to some other cause than death. The proof of her
identity, however, particularly by means of her clothes, is
sufficiently established in the minds of the municipal and
Police authorities, to dissipate the seemingly delusive hope
of her surviving. And although incredulity may still disbe-
lieve, and fancy conceive that she is not numbered with the
dead, yet the evidence is satisfactory to our mind that she
has been brutally murdered; and that time, the revealer of
secrets, will yet bring the authors of the horrid deed to light.
   A foolish story was yesterday started that she had returned
to her home and friends; but no one could tell how or whence
the rumor came abroad, and it was almost universally be-
lieved to be a hoax, or some device of an enemy to put the
authorities off their guard.

			POLICE.
   <i>The case of Mary C. Rogers</i>.—Nothing new has
transpired to elicit light upon this mysterious case.
No new arrests have been made, nor any persons
that the Reporter could learn, suspected. The
opinion that Miss Rogers met her fate on this side of
the river, gains ground rapidly, and the general im-
pression seems to be, that she did not get many
blocks from her mother's house.
   Whatever may be the truth of the case, time alone
can discover, and meanwhile we trust that our au-
thorities will not relax their vigilance.
   Since writing the above, Mr. Crommelin has call-
ed upon us, and requested us to make known his
dissent from a very long and labored article of two
columns, which appeared in the Tattler penny paper,
urging the strong probability that Miss Rogers is still
alive, and that the body found at Hoboken was not
that of the unfortunate girl. Upon this point we
have heard but one opinion, and however strange
may have seemed the conduct of her relations, and of
Mr. Payne, her betrothed, we are entirely convinced
that the body was sufficiently identified. After being
disinterred and brought to this city, the clothes were
submitted to the mother, aunt, and an intimate friend
of the hapless girl, and all at once recognized them;
the mother even pointing out some particular repairs
done on the Saturday previous to her leaving home.
   We should not have noticed this affair at all, were
it not that the ardour of the Police authorities might
be damped, were they become convinced that they
were pursuing a shadow. No doubt whatever rests
on our mind, that Miss Rogers was murdered, and
we are compelled to fear, that the mystery now
shrouding her fate, will remain long undiscovered.
   At the Police yesterday, not one single case occur-
red worth noting; there was not even a petty larceny
to disturb the <i title="leisure, peace">otium</i> of the officers.

   <i>Coroner's Office</i>.—The Coroner, on Saturday, held
an inquest on the body of Wm. Hope, one of the
crew of the U. S. Steamer Fulton. On Friday night
while the Gig (to which boat, Hope belonged) was
lying at Coenties slip, his hat fell overboard, and he
stooped down on the string piece of the wharf to
reach it. While in this position, he lost his balance,
fell overboard, and being unable to swim, was drown-
ed—Verdict, accidental drowning.

   Also, upon the body of an unknown woman found
in the North River at the foot of Robinson street.—
Deceased was about 35 years of age, had on a dark
calico frock, but neither hat, shoes or stockings. In
one ear was an ear-ring, in the other a piece of string.
Verdict, found drowned.

Also—The Coroner yesterday held an inquest
on the body of James Rourke aged 18, who
fell in the East River on Saturday night at the foot
of Clinton street, about 10 o'clock. Some persons
on board the sloop Alfred, were aroused by cries of
some person in the water shouting for help, but be-
fore assistance could be rendered, the unfortunate
man sunk to rise no more. Verdict, <u title="accidentally">accidently</u>
drowned.

   Also, upon the body of William Cooper, lying at
the City Hospital. The deceased fell into the East
River on the 21st inst., at the foot of <u title="Catherine">Cathrine</u> street,
while in a state of intoxication and was got out after
being nearly drowned. He was taken to the city
Hospital, where he died yesterday from congestion
of the brain produced by his ducking and intemper-
ance combined. Verdict accordingly.

		<f15>Farther Particulars,</f15>
	<i>Concerning the Murder of Miss Rogers.</i>
   We have just space enough for a condensed statement
of some new and important developments in this horrid
transaction. The authorities have without doubt, now got
upon the right track. Joseph W. Morse, the individual
who was seen in her company (and <i>quarrelling with her</i>) at
Hoboken, and who immediately fled the city, was arrested
at Holden, Mass. and brought back for examination. Let-
ters addressed to him from N. Y. were intercepted, con-
taining information that he was suspected, cautioning him
to shave off his whiskers and otherwise disguise himself.—
Daniel <u>Paine</u>, to whom the murdered girl was to have
been married, is supposed to be the writer of the letters,
and suspicions have been entertained against him ever
since he made his affidavit before the Court. His whole
conduct appears to have been singularly indifferent and
unlover-like. While the mysterious absence of the girl
was creating the greatest alarm among her friends, he cool-
ly went about his usual business; and when news was
brought him that her body had been found in the water
near the Hoboken shore, he did not even go there, but kept
on about his business!
   We do not see it stated that <u>Paine</u> is under arrest, but
most likely is. Morse in undergoing a secret examination
before the Upper Police Court.
   It is altogether the most horrible instance of brutality
on record. The physician who made a post mortem ex-
amination of the body states that it bore unerring evidence
of having been barbarously violated by more than three or
four different men in succession. Discolorations were
found about the mouth, neck, wrists, &c. as though she
had been bound and gagged.—portions of the under dress
were torn away, probably to make bands and gags of. A
cord was accidentally <u title="discovered">discovored</u> tied tightly around the
neck and entirely imbedded in the <u title="flesh">flesd</u>, and the supposi-
tion is, that towards the last of the tragedy the sufferer
fainted and in that condition the cord was tied to prevent
return of consciousness, and that when dead, the body was
thrown into the water.
   Morse, just before leaving the city, had a quarrel with
his wife, which he probably brought about to furnish him
with an excuse for so abruptly absconding, if he should
afterwards need one. When apprehended he inquired,
“what is this arrest for?”—and was answered, “for abusing
your wife.”—“O, is that all?” said Morse, apparently feel-
ing much relieved by the intelligence.

	THE MURDER OF MISS ROGERS!
   Arrest of the person who most probably com-
mitted the hellish deed.
   Officer <u>Hilliker</u>, attached to our Upper Police,
yesterday arrived in this city by one of the Eas-
tern boats, having in charge a young man, named
Joseph W. Morse, a wood engraver at 120 Nas-
sau street, whom he arrested at Worcester, in
the State of Massachusetts, on suspicion of hav-
ing murdered this unfortunate girl. The circum-
stances affecting the guilt of the accused are
substantially as follows:—Morse, is a married
man, and for some time past has lived on terms
of any thing but that which should exist between
man and wife, consequently creating a natural
feeling in the breast of the partner<u> </u>his bosom,
strongly tending to excite suspicion of his infi-
delity. On the night of the murder he went to
his home, having been out all day, and from the
lateness of the hour was accosted by his wife in
terms of reproach on account of his neglect,
when an altercation ensued, and he <u title="arose">arrose</u> from
the bed with the intention of leaving her. With
all that inherent feeling natural to woman, she
expostulated with him for his rashness in quit-
ting at that unseasonable hour of night his
home and bed. Morse, losing all the attributes
belonging to a man, struck her a violent blow,
which prostrated her to the ground and fled the
house. As he did not return on the following
day, the wife instituted a process against him
for an assault and battery, and a warrant was
consequently issued, but Morse was no where
to be found, and as his manner of leaving the ci-
ty was attended with strong indications of some-
thing more than ordinary in matters where man
and wife are concerned in a mere family broil,
officer <u>Hilliker</u> was dispatched in search of him,
and found him at Worcester, in Massachusetts.
At the Post Office of which place the officer in-
tercepted a letter to Morse, in which a person,
whose name we could not learn, but as we have
reason to believe, has had something to do with
this foul transaction, recommended him to shave
off his whiskers, in order to disguise himself, as
he feared that he would be recognized as being
the perpetrator of this deed. When arrested,
he seemed to be much confused, and was anx-
ious to <u title="ascertain">acertain</u> what was the nature of the com-
plaint against him, and being told that it was
on the warrant of assault and battery committed
on his wife, seemed incredulous, and more than
once demanded of the officer to tell him if some-
thing of a graver nature was not his mission
with him. A ring was taken from his finger,
which was doubtless made for a female hand;
and, it is said, that there is proof indisputable
that he was in company with the unfortunate
Mary Rogers on the evening she was murdered.
   The Mayor (R. H. Morris, Esq.) was active
during the whole of yesterday in investigating
this matter, but deferred the examination of the
accused till this day, and therefore all the partic-
ulars that could possibly be collected are given.
Our next will probably enlighten our readers on
this dark and appalling subject.

			<m9><b>For The Tribune.</b></m9>
   T<small>HE</small> M<small>URDER OF</small> M<small>ISS</small> R<small>OGERS</small>.—The opinion I believe
is pretty general that Miss Rogers was <i>not seen</i> on Sunday,
25th July, after leaving her mother's house, and such, I per-
ceive, by the Tribune of this day, is also your opinion. I be-
lieve, however, that she <i>was seen</i> by two persons in the
morning of the 25th July, and I arrive at this conclusion as
follows:
   1. G. W. Dixon says he saw her on the 25th July in com-
pany with a man (who answers the description given of
Morse,) in Ann st. near Theatre Alley, at about 10 o'clock,
A. M. This statement was made by him to Mr. Hugh <u>Pat-
tison</u> on the day or day after the finding of the body at Hobo-
ken.
   2. Mr. John Conroy testifies that he met Morse in Ann
st. near Broadway on Sunday, 25th July, between 10 and
10½ o'clock, A. M.—That Morse was in company with <i>a
very handsome and well dressed female</i>—that he has known
Morse for several years and spoke to him as he passed in
Ann street.
   3. If for any reason the statement of Dixon cannot be fully
relied on, is it not fully and satisfactorily corroborated by
the testimony of Mr. Conroy?
   With regard to this mysterious murder I trust that you
and every other Editor will continue to keep it before the
people. When is the Mayor to offer a reward?

	<b>The Mary Rogers Mystery.</b>
   No further developments have been made in rela-
tion to the alleged murder and violation of Mary C.
Rogers, not have any arrests been made by either
the Upper or Lower Police authorities. Many peo-
ple now begin to believe that Mary has not been
murdered, after all, and although the behaviour of
her family and especially of her quondam lover,
Payne, would seem to favor such an hypothesis, yet
still it does seem incredible that the clothes of Mary
should be found on the body of a stranger. For it
will be observed that although Mary's <u>lovers</u> and
family would not, or could not, recognize the body,<!-- Crommelin recognized the body, and even "rubbed her arm for the purpose of identifying her". -->
yet three of them swear to the clothes she had on.
It is also very strange that no one should see her
after her interview with Payne, at 10 o'clock on the
Sunday she disappeared, and that the object of her
leaving <i>the rose</i> at <u>Cromelin</u>'s lodgings should never
have been explained, nor the public be able to learn
whether or not she repeated her visit to Mr. C., on
the Sunday <i>after she had paid a farewell visit to Payne</i>.
Then the fact which is alleged, that old Mrs. Rogers
told her negro servant after Mary had left for her
aunt's, “that in all probability they should never
see Mary again alive,” would seem to favor the no-
tion that Mary's fate was expected by her nearest
relative.
   We throw out these facts, for just what they are
worth in the absence of all other testimony, than
what we have hitherto given to our readers. We
believe we have given every particle of evidence
adduced either at Hoboken or here, since the find-
ing of the body, and we shall not let the matter
sleep.
   The house 126 Nassau street, is now unten-
anted, and Mary's mother has removed to the resi-
dence of a Mr. O'Hara, a surgeon, in Jane street.
Mrs. Rogers is not so infirm a woman, as people
would seem to believe, and this fact may be of im-
portance in any subsequent inquiries, as her age is
adduced as an excuse for her not going to Hoboken
to recognize the body of her daughter. There is
yet a mystery in this business, which time alone can
unravel.

			POLICE.
   <i>The case of Mary C. Rogers.</i>—An absurd story
was circulated yesterday in the city, by a penny pa-
per (the Planet,) that a letter had been received from
Pittsburg, Pa., stating that M<small>ARY</small> C. R<small>OGERS</small> had
been there in company with a man named G<small>ETCHELL</small>
—that she had left this city with him, having left a
letter on her table informing her mother of the step
she had taken, and that immediately upon hearing
this, Mr. Crommelin had started for Illinois. In the
first place, no such letter has been received. In the
second place, Mr. Crommelin was in the city yester-
day, P. M., as large as life, and we did not learn that
he had any intention of migrating to Illinois, and in
the 3d place, Mary C. Rogers being dead and buried,
could not very well have written any letter. These
stories at the best are ill advised, and have a tenden-
cy only to keep up a feverish excitement in the com-
munity; to check the efforts of the authorities in
ferreting out her murderers, and can only serve one
end, i. e. the sale of the paper that can say most up-
on the subject. The papers have have already been
filled to repletion with details of this case, and we
trust no more will be said until something definite is
known.

Morse, on the fatal Sunday, was seen walking with
her through Ann street, as early as ten o'clock. We
are informed that this is not the fact. He never saw
her, and did not know her. One thing we should
like to know—“who are the two men who swore,
at the police office, that they saw Morse sitting with
Mary <u>Rodgers</u>, at Hoboken, on the fatal evening?”
They identified, as it was called, Morse, at the Police
office. Who are these men? Ought they not to be
examined at once before they attempt to swear away
the life of another man? Is not their evidence very
mysterious in the face of the girl in black, and the
Staten Island hotel-keeper?
   While on this subject, a friend of Morse's has
handed us the annexed for publication:—
<m9>   <i>Mr. Morse</i>.—Now that the press has sufficiently black
balled the character of Mr. Morse, owing to his very
shallowly supposed participation in the murder of Miss
<u>Rodgers</u>, and that he has entirely vindicated himself from
all shadow of suspicion in that matter, it may be time to
do him a little justice. Some of the papers have stated
that he was a rowdy and a gambler; if so, it has been
without the knowledge of himself, or of his nearest
friends; and he challenges any person to come forward
and prove the allegation. He has been accused of abusing
his wife; and this is also an error; Mr. Morse, owing
to some domestic difficulties, to which all families are
liable, has been separated from his wife for upwards of
six month, and she had threatened a suit against him
to the end of compelling him to return; by the advice of
a third person, however, who informed her that the Court
would not entertain the complaint unless she coupled
it with an accusation of personal ill treatment, she
took out a warrant for assault and battery, which is the
full truth of his much bruited about harsh conduct as
regards that matter. To this fact Mrs. M. will testify.
In reference to the affair on Staten Island, it finds a good
deal of <u title="palliation">paliation</u> in the fact that Mr. Morse was six
months separated from his wife when it occurred; and
if this does not in all exonerate him from blame, why let
the man who thinks he is perfect come forward, and cast
the first stone. A statement has been made that Mr.
Morse commenced his business career in this city by
selling newspapers in the street; this is altogether a
gratuitous assertion, as he never sold newspapers in
the street or anywhere else. He arrived in New
York at the age of fourteen, and found immediate
employment in the store of Mr. Buckley, 48 South
street; from thence he went to attend store for Mr. James
Brown in Washington street. Preferring a profession,
however, to a clerkship, he engaged himself on trial to
Mr. Montania, a lapidary in Reed street. While here, he
amused himself with carving images on blocks of wood,
which were seen by a publisher, who perceiving that
the bent of his genius inclined that way, persuaded him
to adopt wood engraving as a profession, a suggestion
which met his approbation, and thereon he applied him-
self without any superintendence, or instruction, to the
graving of wood; and his present eminence in his pro-
fession, (for it is going not a whit too far to say, that he
is second to none in this city,) is the result. His first at-
tempt at cutting in wood was made with a three square
file, and even the rough production then and thus made,
found its way into a paper. In evidence of Mr. Morse's
high stand among the artists in his line in this city, it
may be observed <i>en passant</i>, that he has taken two sil-
ver medals for the best specimens of wood engraving;
one at the Mechanics' Institute last year, and the other at
the Fair of the American Institute the year before. This
latter fact says more than a volume in proof, that Mr.
Morse is neither rowdy <u>or</u> a gambler, but a gentleman
who attends to his business.</m9>
   On the other hand, we have received the follow-
ing from the mother of the girl in black:—
<m9>M<small>R</small>. E<small>DITOR</small>:—
   I have been called on to state, for the benefit of those it
may interest, that my place of residence is not in <i>Morton</i>
street. Having been obliged to leave the city, and not
wishing to interrupt the study of my daughter, I left her
to board with a friend in that street. Also, she was never
at a ball, or any place of amusement; never worked at
the type foundry, or any other trade; had not arrived at
her 16th year; did not intend to send her to <i>Staten Island
Seminary</i>; was preparing to move in the country, when
I received a shock that nothing but the grace of God will
enable me to bear.</m9>
   Altogether, this murder is one of the greatest mys-
teries of blood that ever was perpetrated. Yet we
do not despair of discovering the monsters. The
murderers of old Captain White, of Salem, were en-
veloped in as deep a mystery for about six weeks,
but they were discovered at last. What, then, is to
be done? Let every fellow's face and actions be
watched when the tale of blood is told. The perpe-
trators cannot sit quietly under that story of blood.
They will betray themselves in some point. Such
was the case with the <u>Crowningshields</u> and Knapp
of Boston. As to the story told that Mary <u>Rodgers</u>
is still alive—it is base and foolish.
   Since the above was written, our Reporter has as-
certained that nothing is known at present in rela-
tion to any trace of the murderers of Mary Rogers,
at either of the police offices. At the Egyptian
Tombs the magistrates say frankly that they give up
all hope of <u title="ferreting">feretting</u> them out; but the magnates
of the Upper Police shake their heads, and hope to
be more successful with the next runaway they get
hold of. All the authorities, however, concur in the
opinion that the identification of the body found at
Hoboken was full and complete. And they ask, too,
with great force, if that was not the body of Mary
Rogers, whose body was it, and how came the
clothes of Mary to be found thereon?
   It is said that old Mrs. Rogers burnt up a bundle
of letters belonging to Mary on the day of the in-
quest. This ought to be explained.

   H<small>ORRIBLE</small> S<small>TATE OF</small> A<small>FFAIRS</small>.—Since the oc-
currence of what is believed to have been a brutal
violation and murder of the ill-starred Miss Rogers,
we have received a large number of communica-
tions, informing us of the haunts in this city of
gangs of miscreants who are believed to be in the
habit of committing the most diabolical outrages
upon unprotected persons and property. To some
of the best authenticated of these, we have given
place in our columns; while others were either
not of a nature suitable for publication, or were
not sufficiently authentic to warrant us in making
them public. If but half of what has been com-
municated to us is true, the lives and safety of our
citizens are in most appalling and disgraceful jeo-
pardy, and it is safer to venture among the wildest
hordes of Bedouins than to hazard one's self be-
yond the eye and immediate protection of our po-
lice, or the reach of social protection. The su-
burbs of our city are at the mercy of gangs of
lawless desperadoes, who make reprisals and cap-
tures on the waters on either side of our island,
and perpetrate the most fiendish outrages upon the
adjacent shores. Who can read the following
statement—(and we believe every word of it)—
without shuddering at the boldness and impunity
with which the most demoniac wickedness
	“Stalks unrevenged among us.”
   Nor is the gang here spoken of the only one in
this city of like character, employed in like pur-
suits, of which we have recently become inform-
ed. The vicinities of several other markets and
public places near the water, are cursed with simi-
lar crews of wretches; and many of their mani-
fold transgressions that would put the blush upon
the cheek of the most heartless pirate that ever
dangled from a yard-arm, have been communicat-
ed to us.
   Why is this horrible and disgraceful state of
things allowed to remain as it is? The police
cannot but be aware of its existence, and of some
of the horrors which it has produced. All that is
needed to put an end to it is a prompt and vigo-
rous interference on the part of the municipal au-
thorities—or, that not being attainable, on the part
of our citizens themselves. How long would
such a gang as our correspondent describes, be
able to perpetrate their iniquities without meeting
summary justice, in any other city in the Union?
Not forty-eight hours. An opportunity is now af-
forded to begin the work of reform in this matter
in an efficacious and certain manner. Our corres-
pondent offers to place the vindication of the laws,
and the retribution due to justice, in the reach of
the proper authorities, if the dreadfully injured
parties will but afford the facility they alone can
give. We doubt not he will fulfil his pledge.—
Shall it be done now, or shall we have to wait till
more outrages at which the thought revolts and
humanity shudders—more rapine, and more mur-
ders, were perpetrated? Let prompt and ener-
getic action in the right quarter answer for us.
   We did not see the paragraph in the Sunday
paper referred to, and consequently are not aware
which of the many like transactions known to
have occurred, is referred to in it. Those more im-
mediately interested in it will however, readily
understand to what it alludes; and it is due to
the peace and safety and honor of our city, that
they without delay, extend the co-operation asked
for.
   Our correspondent writes:
<l9>   T<small>O THE</small> E<small>DITOR OF THE</small> S<small>UN</small>:—S<small>IR</small>—The
name of Roberts mentioned in a Sunday paper as
one of a party in a club boat who took a girl from
another boat and transferred her to their own, and
afterwards violated her in the thickets at Wee-
hawken, need not be mentioned only, as it is well
known in the neighborhood of the Clinton market,
(known from the boasting of the very parties them-
selves who were in the boat with Roberts and vi-
olated the woman alluded to in the Sunday pa-
per,) that a gang of the worst set of rowdies hang
around the porter houses in the vicinity of the
market. They own a club boat, and are in the
daily practice of prowling along the shores of Ho-
boken with their boat, and forcibly taking in any
females they can find, who may be but slightly
guarded, and then forcing them in the woods to a
consummation of their brutal wishes. These fel-
lows are skilful oarsmen, and can in a few mo-
ments outstrip almost any pursuers in speed. If
they be closely pressed by the friends of their vic-
tims, they will fight with the fury of demons and
overpower almost any opposition. They are a
very desperate set, nay, the terror of the neigh-
borhood, as the citizens around the market to their
sorrow can testify. These fellows make no se-
crets of their hellish tricks, but make a point of
boasting of the successful issue of their adven-
tures. Roberts is the best man among them all;
and it is only when intoxicated that he will ever
join them in evil fellowship. I heard one of the
gang telling another who had been out of town,
that one Friday afternoon ten of them took a girl
in the woods, and each one violated her, “<i>till she
foamed at the mouth, by J—s!</i>” These were the
very words—at which they set up a hearty
laugh—it being to them the most capital joke in
the world, to thus treat a poor female.
   These chaps have no visible means of earning
a living, for they won't work, but have a <u title="knack">nack</u> of
getting along somehow. I heard them boasting on
Friday last of the “fun” they had with the girl
they took out of the boat in company with Rob-
erts, as alluded to in the Sunday paper, and I have
no reason to doubt of their guilt. Now, Mr. Edi-
tor, if the friends of the girl wish to confront these
fellows with the girl herself, in order to ascertain
their identity, I will give them their names in full,
by their merely requesting through your paper
such an announcement.

   T<small>HE</small> M<small>ARY</small> R<small>OGERS</small> A<small>FFAIR</small>.—This bloody affair
seems to furnish a great deal of twaddle to the penny
papers. One attempts to prove that Mary Rogers
is still alive—another states that she is at Pittsburgh,
and another that her own friends had something to
do with her death. It is even sought to be proved,
that Doctor Cook of Hoboken, a very eminent phy-
sician, knows nothing of his profession—and that
his evidence is not to be believed.
   What is the meaning of all this effort to <u>mistify</u>
and lead astray? Is it not produced by the arts and
appliances of those who may be the perpetrators?—
or who know who they are? It looks very suspi-
cious at least. As far as human testimony can go,
it is proved, beyond the possibility of a doubt, that
<i>Mary Rogers was violated and murdered by more
than two persons</i>—and, according to all probability,
that this horrid act was perpetrated in some stable,
outhouse, or such place, by one of those gangs of
rowdies, blacklegs, gamblers, or soaplocks, who
form the society of the houses of ill fame, and the
low gambling shops.
   Can this be controverted with any degree of force?
What can be the motive of those who lead astray
the public mind? Certainly not good. Let it be
followed up.
<m9>			[From our Reporter.]
   Justice <s>Stevens</s> is of opinion that the police have ob-
tained some clue to the miscreants who perpetrated the
outrage and murder on Mary Rogers, but that it will be
some days yet before the inquiry will be in such a shape
as to justify the authorities in making the matter public.
The clerks of the upper police also profess to believe that
they have got on the right scent this time, and that if the
newspapers would cease “their agitation,” the truth
would be elicited. These gentlemen say that people will
not come forward, lest they should have their names
dragged before the public, and that, but for the discus-
sion which has been kept up, they think they should
have traced out Mary's whereabouts, on the fatal Sun-
day, before this. If there are any such people as these
in existence, all we have to say about them is, that they
are either very wicked, or very foolishly wicked, if
they neglect to aid the public authorities in tracing out
the hiding place of a gang of ravishers and murderers,
and foolish if they would suffer their own <u title="thin-skinnedness">thin-skined-
ness</u> to stand for one moment between their prejudices
and the sacred cause of public justice. If say man, rich
or poor, possessing the respectability of wealth or not,
has remained quiet whilst in the possession of any fact
which could tend to clear up this mystery, we envy not
his notions of right, or yet the advantages of such a ne-
gation of respectability as he seems to hug himself up in.
We are told, on good authority, that some such person
is to be examined, but think he must have been hoaxing
the magistrates. In the mean time, the actual fact of the
girl's murder is doubted by many well-informed persons.</m9>

<d>[Col.1. Partly as in <a href="#Evening-Post-1841-08-21">Evening Post</a>]</d>
	MURDER OF MARY C. ROGERS.
   We stated last week that Joseph W. Morse,
had been arrested on suspicion of being the mur-
derer of this ill fated girl; but it seems he is in-
nocent of that crime although guilty of one but
little less heinous. He ought to be hung for his
bad character.
   T<small>HE</small> M<small>URDER OF</small> M<small>ISS</small> R<small>OGERS</small>.—<i>Morse not
now supposed to be the Murderer</i>.—Strange and
various as were the circumstances tending to im-
plicate Morse in the murder of Miss Rogers, sub-
sequent development seem to show that he had
nothing to do with it.
   Morse, from the time he was first arrested, per-
sisted in saying that he was at Staten Island, on
the afternoon and night of the Sunday when it was
alleged he was seen at Hoboken. He, however,
could not tell the name of a female, who, he said,
accompanied him and remained there with him all
night; nor could he tell the name of any person
who had seen him there. His alleged ignorance
of her name rendered his statement incredible.—
The Mayor, however, went down to Staten Is-
land, on Wednesday afternoon, and ascertained
that a man answering the description of Morse,
passed that Sunday night at one of the hotels at
Staten Island, along with a young girl, about 17
years old. Yesterday morning the name of the
girl was discovered, and she was brought to the
upper Police Office, where she deposed that on
the afternoon of the Sunday in question, she met
Morse in Bleecker street, and that he induced her
to accompany him to Staten Island; that under
one or other pretext he detained her there until
the last boat for New York had left the Island,
and that he then persuaded her to pass the night
in the same room with him; and that during the
night he endeavored to have improper intercourse
with her, but that she did not allow him; and that
on the following day, Monday, he came back with
her to N. York and took his leave of her at the
corner of Barclay and Greenwich street. As the
young lady, however indiscreet she may have ac-
ted, is said to have hitherto maintained a good
character, we forbear to mention her name.
   The testimony of the girl is further corrobora-
ted by the fact of four individuals, namely, Messrs.
<u title="James (elsewhere)">John</u> Conner, W. H. Hicks, R. <u title="Backer, Becker (elsewhere)">Bucker</u> and W. J.
McKee, having on that Sunday, about three o'-
clock in the afternoon, seen Morse and the young
lady walking down Broadway towards the Batte-
ry. These gentlemen knew both Morse and the
lady, and as one of the above gentlemen had been
known to pay particular attentions to the lady on
some former occasions, another of the party re-
marked to him, “There goes your girl.” There
can therefore be scarcely a doubt that the person
seen sitting on the bench at Hoboken, with Miss
Rogers or some other young lady on that Sunday,
was not Morse, and so far he seems to have ex-
culpated himself from the charge of murdering
Miss Rogers.—<i>Jour. of Commerce of Friday</i>.
   The evening edition of the same paper contains
the following article.
   It now turns out if Morse's statement can be re-
lied on that he never had any acquaintance with
Miss Rogers, nor could he identify her from any
other female in the city. Nor did he know the name
of the girl, as he has all along alleged, who so im-
prudently accompanied him to Staten Island.—
And when he heard of the body of Miss Rogers
having been found in the river, he supposed that
it was Miss Rogers who had accompanied him to
Staten Island, and who felt so degraded by re-
maining with him all night, that she had in con-
sequence committed suicide by drowning herself.
This suspicion on his part shows that the fellow
must have a tolerable correct appreciation of the
feelings of a virtuous female, in consequence of
having so indiscreetly subjected herself to insult
and loss of character, for the young lady who did
accompany him, has been so deeply affected by
the occurrence and the consequent ordeal she was
obliged to go through at the upper Police Office,
in being most minutely examined as to every thing
which occurred between her and Morse, that she
yesterday morning procured laudanum to destroy
herself, and only for an accidental and timely dis-
covery of her intentions by her family, she would
probably have <u title="succeeded in her purpose (Evening-Post-1841-08-21)">been at this time another victim</u>.
   Morse, although discharged from the complaint
against him for the murder of Miss Rogers is still
detained in prison until he can procure unques-
tionable bail in the sum of $1000, to answer the
complaint against him for maltreating his wife.
   We are persuaded that pursuit has hitherto been
on a false scent, so far as it has been directed to
Hoboken. It is impossible that a person so well
known to thousands as this young woman was,
should have passed three blocks without some
one having seen her; and any one who saw her
would have remembered it; for she interested all
who knew her. It was when the streets were full
of people that she went out. See how soon the
girl who accompanied Morse to Staten Island was
recognized, and how many witnesses there are to
her being out. Yet she was but seventeen years
old, and had always lived secluded, Miss Rogers
was twenty-three. A hundred knew her to one
who knew the other. It is therefore impossible
that she should have gone to Hoboken, or to Jane
street, without being recognized by a dozen per-
sons; yet no one has come forward who saw
her outside of her mother's door, and there is
no evidence except the testimony concerning her
<i>expressed intention</i>, that she did go out at all. Her
gown was torn, bound round her, and tied; and
by that the body was carried as a bundle. If the
murder had been committed at Hoboken, there
would have been no necessity for any such ar-
rangement. The fact that the body was found floa-
ting near Hoboken, is no proof as to where it was
thrown into the water. The murder must have
been committed near to her mother's house, and
the nearer, the more likely. There are places
within a few rods of the door, where such a deed
would be as likely to be committed as any where
in the city. A piece of one of the unfortunate
girl's petticoats, two feet long and one foot wide,
was torn out and tied under her chin and around
the back of her head, probably to prevent her
screams. This was done by fellows who had no
pocket handkerchief.
   Perhaps these considerations are not new to the
police, but they need, we think to be considered
by the neighborhood. In our judgement the un-
happy girl had not proceeded many steps, when
she was induced for some purpose to step within
a door, which was closed upon her, and she was
there murdered, during Sunday. It was probably
not a parlor, or bedroom, or any part of a dwell-
ing house, nor a public place of any sort.—<i>Jour.

a young female, whom he had decoyed from her home.
He proved himself to be only the <u title="villain">villian</u> of anoth-
er shade. The Journal of Commerce has some very
sensible remarks, in relation to the case of Miss <u>Rodg-
ers</u>. That paper says, that in all the stories connected
with her case, there is no evidence of her leaving her
home, other than her own assertion to do so. From
this fact, that paper reasons, that she met her death
in her own neighborhood, because had she traversed
but one block, so well was she known, she would have
been recognized. We have all along been of the
opinion that the police officers of that city, have been
on the wrong scent, in laying the scene of this tragedy
at Hoboken. We firmly believe that she was murder-
ed in the city of New York, and every probability
goes strongly to show that it was not far from her
home.

			POLICE—Saturday.
   <i>The Case of Mary C. Rogers.</i>—On Saturday a man
was arrested and committed for examination on the
charge of having participated in the outrage and mur-
der of Miss Rogers. As the evidence against him now
is purely circumstantial, we deem it most advisable to
omit his name until something at least definite shall
transpire, as it would hardly be fair to brand a man
with the suspicion of such an outrage, who may be
entirely innocent.
   Beyond the above there was nothing at the Police
Office which would warrant us in occupying space in
the paper to record it.

<d>[Col.4]</d>
<m9>   ☞ Having by the advice of many friends and the often re-
peated assurances of the gentlemen connected with the Police,
which has as yet never been complied with, allowed a certain
class of the penny press to go on from day to day to calumniate
me, without their asking for one moment on what grounds,
whether slight or sufficient. And supposing their vituperation
to be well spent—as it is mere repetition—now to show my fel-
low citizens that I fear no questions and wear no mask. I in the
most public manner demand, wish and expect an open investiga-
tion of all and every part of my conduct in relation to the inqui-
ries respecting the murder of Miss Rogers—no secret inquisitio-
nal proceedings—we will have all the forms of law, and in open
Court, with the reporters and other members of the press pre-
sent, and one reporter sworn to report literally as spoken.—
I also demand that Mrs. Rogers, the mother, Mr. Payne, the
lover, and Mr. Hays, the cousin, shall be present, and also such
other persons as I will name as witnesses shall be summoned,
and that they all answer such questions as shall be put to them
by me, or my counsel, on my having sufficient notice. If such in-
vestigation is granted for me to ascertain the residence of a few
witnesses, say 2 or 3 days. To give some little plea of the
grounds of slander, and the accuracy of the information of the
papers before alluded to, it was near <s>6</s> o'clock before I made up
my mind to differ from my friends, and make any reply what-
ever in the papers. In 20 minutes I ascertained the remains
of Miss Rogers were not interred at the expense of the family,
as Mr. Hays states, confirmed by Mr. Payne, but by the
city. Mr. <u>Callender</u>, Clerk of the Police, paid the under-
taker the whole of the expense, $29 <s>??</s>, also, it was not at
the early hour he states, but quarter to 12 o'clock, at noon; fur-
ther, no person followed, but a stout man in a brown coat, took
a cab, and went to the Carmine st. church, where it was depos-
ited. For the accuracy of this, I refer Mr. McCadden, the Un-
dertaker, who has kindly allowed me to make use of his name.
So one story is very good, but there is two sides to it.

   T<small>HE</small> M<small>ARY</small> R<small>OGERS</small> M<small>YSTERY</small>.—The lamentable out-
rage, so disgraceful to the character of our “moral and
noble city,” seems to be involved now in the most im-
penetrable mystery. The authorities of the upper police
office who were so sanguine of their circumstantial tes-
timony, which was right, doubtless, in every point of
view, but that of identity, now confess that they cannot
make head or tail of the affair. After the acquittal of
Morse, it appears that they arrested some other “genteel
looking man with whiskers,” but he proved an alibi,
and on Friday last was honorably discharged. The de-
positions and the examinations of the accusers and ac-
cused, are carefully veiled from the public eye; the ac-
cusations are made in secret—the trial if it can be called
one, is held in a sort of star chamber to which the public
have no access, and the names of these very veracious
pair of sharp sighted witnesses, who first swore they saw
Morse sitting and quarrelling with the cigar girl at Ho-
boken, on the stormy Sunday night, and since to some one
else, are carefully withheld from the press and the pub-
lic. After this it would be futile to talk of the po-
litical accusations which were <u>dropt</u> into the Lion's
mouth at Venice, of <i>lettres de cashets</i>, and all that sort of
tyrannical machinery, because these proceedings have
been quite as shameful and might have proved as fatal
to both life and reputation.
   The up town authorities having thus given the matter
up, the lower police intend to try their hand again, and
this time Crommelin is to appeal to a judicial tribunal;
and it was rumored on Saturday night, that his friend
Padley, is for some reason or other placed in the tombs.
   Since the above was written, we have ascertained from
Mr. Hyde, the keeper of the city prison, that Archibald
W. Padley, was committed to his custody on the evening
of the 27th instant, by the order of Justice Parker; that
Padley stands charged with the abduction, rape, and
murder of Mary Cecilia Rogers. If the examination, <u title="or">on</u>
the grounds for the accusation and imprisonment of this
person are ever made public, we suppose that the mystery
of the rose will be explained, and the probabilities ascer-
tained of Mary Rogers having visited Crommelin on the
Sunday, after she called on Payne. From the first we
have called attention to this circumstance.
   A<small>NOTHER</small> O<small>UTRAGE ON A</small> D<small>EFENCELESS</small> F<small>EMALE</small>.—The
keeper of one of the most fashionable brothels in the
city, who is known to all the elite of the upper crust
soaplock fraternity, by the style and title of Madame la
<u title="duchesse">duchese</u> de Berry, was arrested by Prince John, and
brought before the Magistrate, charged with the perpe-
tration of one of the most violent and atrocious assaults
which one she-devil ever inflicted on another of the
same sex. Mary Capeto, a young and very beautiful
girl of seventeen, stated that she boarded for some
time with <i>la duchesse</i>, and that on Friday she entered
her apartment, seized complainant by the throat, threw
her on the bed, and then tore her face, neck and throat
in such a way that if assistance had not been at hand,
the consequences might have been fatal. The Magis-
trate ordered <i>Madame</i> to find bail in the sum of $500,
which, after some delay, she procured, in the person of
James McAllister, of Division street, and Madame was
then liberated from the tombs, with the comfortable as-
surance from “his eminence Prince John,” that a civil
suit would be instituted, and the damages laid at some-
where near five thousand dollars.

   T<small>HE</small> M<small>ARY</small> R<small>OGER'S</small> M<small>YSTERY</small>.—The whole coun-
try is beginning to feel an interest in the brutal vio-
lation and murder of Mary Rogers. Read the fol-
lowing:—
<m9>			P<small>HILADELPHIA</small>, Aug. 27, 1841.
M<small>R</small>. B<small>ENNETT</small>:—
   The mystery which yet surrounds the terrible case
of Miss Rogers, excites in this community, intense
anxiety—the <u title="'efforts' in Schenectady Reflector">effects</u> by your police to discover the
authors of this “murder most foul” are properly esti-
mated, and do receive merited commendation.
   It has been intimated in your paper of yesterday,
that by persevering efforts the <u title="villains">villians</u> will eventual-
ly be brought to punishment, and it is to be hoped
that <u title="perseverance">perseverence</u> will be unremitted.
   Whether you have any recollection or knowledge
of a case somewhat similar, which occurred in New
York, very many years ago, I do not know. It was
that of a certain Levi Weeks (whose brother, a most
estimable man, was then the owner of the City Ho-
tel.) Levi was charged with the abduction and
murder of a Miss Sands, who was taken from her
sister's house in <u title="Greenwich">Greenwick</u> street, conveyed by her
lover, to whom she was engaged to be married, on
a cold winter night, and in a then lonely street,
thrown into a well of large size owned by the <u title="Manhattan">Man-
hatten</u> Company. Being missed, she was sought for
and there found, with marks of violence on her per-
son, showing great <u title="resistance">resistence</u>, and proving the strong
efforts made to preserve herself—her lacerated fin-
gers, &c.
   Now, Sir, the circumstance excited an intense con-
cern, as does the case of Miss Rogers. So great was
the rush to see the body, that it was deemed proper
to place it in the public street, where many thou-
sands looked upon it—among them the writer of
this.
   Weeks was arrested—circumstances were ex-
tremely strong against him, and although acquitted
by the Jury, public feeling was such that he left your
city and never returned to it—he died a vagabond.
   Cadwallader D. Colden was then the Attorney Gen-
eral, and among the witnesses who were introduced
for the defendant, was one individual, whose name I
do not now recollect, who was one of the fatal
sleighing party. Mr. Colden was extremely close in
his examination of that man, and was impressed
with a belief that he was the actual murderer.
   Some time afterwards the witness was indicted
for committing a forgery—and it was most re-
markable that, in that trial, circumstances were de-
veloped which induced Mr. Colden to say, “that is
the murderer of Miss Sands.”
   It would therefore seem, that despite of all the
machinations of the Devil and his imp, that by a
wise Providence “murder will out.”
   I refer you to the documents of that day, and
think you may make a good moral use of the facts.
			Yours,			W. C.</m9>

   T<small>HE CASE OF</small> M<small>ARY</small> C. R<small>OGERS</small>.—Much has
been said in the New York papers during the last
month respecting the sudden disappearance and
most villainous murder of Miss Mary C. Rogers,
who has been long and well known there as the
“beautiful cigar girl.” She was employed, usu-
ally, in a cigar store, and is reported to have pos-
sessed great personal beauty. It seems that she
was last seen on Sunday morning, on the 25th
of July, when she told a young man, <u title="Daniel (elsewhere)">David</u>
Payne, to whom she was engaged to be married,
that she was going to visit at Mrs. Downing's
who resided in a distant part of the city. She
never went there, and for some days no trace
of her could be found; a body was soon after dis-
covered at Hoboken, which was recognized as
hers, though greatly disfigured. The police of
New York were unwearied in their efforts, but
for weeks no clue was found to trace out the per-
petrator of this inhuman crime. A young man,
by the name of Morse, was arrested, and for a
time it was thought that they had finally discov-
ered the murderer, but he proved that he was in
another place at the time the murder must have
been committed, and consequently was discharg-
ed. Every possible surmise has been made, and
every little circumstance seized upon to unravel
the mystery. Some papers have even denied that
the body found is that of Miss Rogers, and a let-
ter had been published, as coming from a gentle-
man in Pittsburg, who had lately seen her, and
the opinion has obtained some credence that she
had eloped to avoid an unpleasant marriage con-
nection that her mother would compel her to
form. But as far as we can learn, there seems to
be but little question but that the body found is
that of Miss Rogers. The following, which we
take from the <a href="#Courier-1841-08-16"" class="l">Courier and Enquirer</a>, seems to
contain the latest information, but yet we fear it
may prove erroneous:
   “We are pleased to be able to state, that at
length, a clue has, beyond all doubt or cavil, been
	...
community, for his success in this outrageous af-
fair.”
   The letter referred to above in pronounced to
be a hoax, got up by the penny papers of the city.

   T<small>HE</small> M<small>ARY</small> R<small>OGERS</small> M<small>YSTERY</small>.—Every thing in re-
lation to this lamentable affair seems to be clothed,
not merely with some impenetrable mystery, but to
be conducted by the authorities with a greater de-
gree of <u title="secrecy">secresy</u>, and consequently of injustice, than
most other judicial investigations. We stated on
Monday that Archibald W. <u>Pabley</u> was arrested on
the 27th, and committed to the tombs by order of
Justice Parker. On Monday evening we applied to
Mr. Hyde, the keeper of the prison, to know if any
thing had been done in the premises, and were in-
formed that <u>Pabley</u> was still in custody. On the
following morning the keeper of the prison received
a discharge for <u>Pabley</u>, and on sending to the interior
for the purpose of liberating the innocent man, he,
the keeper, first learned officially, that <u>Pabley</u> had
been got out the day previous by Justice Parker and
discharged. We know of no greater act of tyranny
than this, even among the high handed measures <u>of
of</u> this said Milne Parker, Esquire, one of the special
justices, et cetera. He first causes a man to be ar-
rested on suspicion of three of the very highest of-
fences known to our laws, viz: abduction, rape and
murder. He subjects this man to the solitude of the
tombs, conceals the facts of his arrest from the pub-
lic, keeps him in durance for three days, then sub-
mits him to a star chamber examination, and finally
lets this man out of prison, so far surreptitiously, that
the keeper of the prison is not informed of the pri-
soner's release until some fifteen hours after the ac-
tion of this learned and astute special justice! Com-
ment on this procedure we could make, but we for-
bear, for Justice Parker has to appear to answer to a
whole catalogue of accusations on the 7th inst. be-
fore the County Court, and we may be charged with
a desire to prejudge his case, and for <i>that</i> reason
we forbear, and leave <u>Pabley</u> to his civil remedy, for
we presume, that though “he is only a foreigner,”
that the libery of the citizen cannot be thus out-
rageously violated without some remedy being pro-
vided under our laws. And it must not be forgotten
that he is the fourth person who has been arrested
and discharged without the shadow of proof being
exhibited against him. In the mean time, the names
of the accusers are carefully concealed. We ask if
this is right? It may be law, but it is not justice.

   ☞ An anonymous correspondent writes us that he 'has
heard a man boast publicly that he was the first one who dis-
covered the body of Mary C. Rogers at Hoboken, that he
dragged it to the shore, and then ran off for fear of the Cor-
oner's inquest.' Why not give the information in some reli-

quarter? A communication of this sort of course not worth
a straw without a name to substantiate the statements; and
with this it may be of the highest service.

<d>[Col.1]</d>
   <b>A Warning to Young Ladies, from the Grave.</b>
   Great excitement has prevailed in this city for some
days past, in consequence of the murder of a Miss Ro-
gers, who has been extensively known here as the “beau-
tiful Cigar Girl,” and who was for a length of time em-
ployed in a cigar store in Broadway. She left home on
Sabbath morning two weeks since, to go, as it was sup-
posed, to Hoboken, but did not return; and when, after
three days' search was made for her, the body was found
in the water, bearing marks of having been most shock-
ingly abused, and then murdered. No discovery of the
dreadful secret has yet been made, by the utmost vigi-
lance of the police, and a profound darkness hangs over
the whole transaction.
   Two things, however, have been clearly proved by the
developments already made—that this unfortunate girl
had no respect for the sanctity of the Sabbath, and that
she was far from select in the choice of her associates.
Her own character is said to have been good, but that of
some of the men implicated in this matter, and who were,
it seems, her familiar acquaintances, is from their own
confession, far from reputable. The impression has
forced itself upon us from day to day, as the circumstan-
ces connected with her death are given to the public, that
the dangers in the pathway of the young female, espe-
cially in our large cities, have never yet been adequately
estimated or presented. If she has the almost fatal gift
of beauty, how many, on every side, will lie in wait to en-
snare and destroy! Hundreds of the young of our sex,
who are dependent on their own industry or ingenuity for
a subsistence, have no parents—others, though not liter-
ally orphans, have fathers or mothers, who, through vice,
ignorance, or imbecility, are incapable of guiding or re-
straining them, and thus they are left, at the most critical
period of life, to follow the dictates of interest, or vanity,
or passion, with none to warn or direct them. Acquaint-
ances are soon made with those of the other sex, who are
on the look-out for this very class—and then follows an
invitation to the public gardens, the theatre, or some
place of public amusement on the Sabbath. Tempters
are at hand to urge the inexperienced girl, who perhaps
from a lingering remembrance of Sabbath school instruc-
tion, hesitates—and as it is only the first step which counts,
when this is taken, her descent is easy. She becomes
impatient of control—reckless of her employers, and care-
<d>[Col.2]</d>
less in the choice of her associates; and the one idea of
dress and amusement fills up her sleeping and waking
thoughts. Now, without a special interposition of Provi-
dence, what is to save one on the brink of such a preci-
pice from making the last fatal plunge? True, she may
not find, like Cecilia Rogers, an early and bloody grave;
but is it no less true in one case than in the other—“<i>the
companion of fools</i> shall be destroyed?”
   Mothers, who feel for the welfare of your own daugh-
ters, an intense anxiety which language is inadequate to
express, let us plead with you in their behalf, and in be-
half of others as innocent and lovely, who have none to
teach, and pity, and shelter them. The natural heart does
not love the commands of God. There must be line upon
line, and precept upon precept, to counteract its vicious
tendencies, and implant right principles. Let your chil-
dren learn from you, to keep God's Sabbath, and to rever-
ence his sanctuary, and to avoid the very appearance of
evil, in the character of those with whom they associate.
A man who has no regard for virtue—who will destroy
female innocence—will, if a sufficiently strong motive is
presented, murder her whom he has seduced from the
path of rectitude, and there can be no safety, either for
soul or body, in the society of such an one.
   But it is not your own children alone, who have claims
on you in reference to this matter. Your domestics—
the youthful seamstress employed by you—in short, all
the young females around you, who have no mother to
guide and guard their steps—demand your sympathy and
your efforts in their behalf. One kind word of advice or
warning, given in the spirit of love, may arrest them when
on the verge of ruin, and save them for time and eternity.
The feeling that there are none to care for them, and that
the false friends who flatter but to betray, are the only be-
ings who have an interest in their welfare—has been fa-
tal to many an artless girl, who, under proper influen-
ces, might have been an ornament to society. There is
a vast amount of responsibility and of guilt resting some-
where in reference to this matter. Let each one of us
see to it, that our garments are not stained with the blood
of these murdered souls.
   One word to the young ladies into whose hands this
paper may fall, and we have done. A voice from the
grave—from an untimely and dishonored grave—speaks
to you in tones of warning and entreaty. Had Cecilia
Rogers loved the house of God—had she reverenced the
Sabbath—had she refused to associate with unprincipled
and profligate men—how different had been her fate!
The penalty annexed to the violation of God's law, has
been, in this case, suddenly and fearfully exacted; but
though of the thousands who are following her example,
few may meet such a fate—the day of reckoning will
come, and their judgment slumbereth not.
   Dear young friends, let this solemn warning sink deep
into your hearts when you are tempted to pride and vani-
ty—to be impatient of wise restraint—to seek your own
pleasure on God's holy day—or to listen to the syren
voice which would lure you from the path of virtue—re-
member the fate of the young and beautiful “cigar girl,”
and thank God that you may still choose the path of peace
and safety. Do not, we entreat you, believe for a moment
that the man, whose character is stained with impurity,
or who would tempt you to sin, can be, under any circum-
stances, a safe companion. He is a wolf in sheep's clo-
thing, and waits only his opportunity to deceive and de-
stroy.

   C<small>ORONER'S</small> O<small>FFICE</small>.—The Coroner had his hands full
of business yesterday, although not one of the cases that
came before him, presented any feature of special inter-
est. The first case was at the foot of <u title="Hubert (in Tribune, Courier)">Herbert</u> street on
the body of John Morehead, who was found drowned in
the North River. Verdict accordingly.
	...
   A<small>LMOST A</small> M<small>ARY</small> R<small>OGERS</small> C<small>ASE</small>.—And lastly at the cor-
ner of King and <u title="West (in Tribune)">Varick</u> streets, on the body of a good
looking young girl about 20 years of age, who had no
doubt been but a short time in the water. She was dress-
ed in a calico frock with purple fringes, muslin under
clothes, and had a plain ring on her <u title="third (in Tribune)">forefinger</u>, but neith-
er bonnet, shoes nor hat on. No testimony was adduced
to show who she was or how she came in the water.
Verdict, found drowned. The body was removed to the
dead house, in case any one should be able to identify it.<f>
   D<small>OG</small> K<small>ILLERS</small>, B<small>EWARE</small>.—The only case of either in-
terest or importance before the police yesterday, was a
charge of assaulting with intent to kill, one of the regu-
lar licensed corporation slaughterers of the poor canine
race. The accused was an old Irishman named Patrick
Collins, who lives on his means at No. 360 Madison
street, and it seems that Pat had a favorite which had
grown old along with him, and was to him a friend.
Somehow or other Pat's dog got out of bounds, as other
puppies do, and Gerard Benson, the dog slayer, meeting
with old Pat's dog, gave him his quietus and poked him
into his cart. When Patrick heard what had happened,
he got a pretty ugly looking pistol, which he loaded, be-
ing enough to have killed all the dog slayers in the city,
and sought out the destroyer of his canine friend, whom
he found snug enough at a grog shop hard by. Pat im-
mediately reproached the dog killer with the cowardice
of the deed he had committed, and told him to prepare to
share the fate he had consigned so many other brutes
to. Gerard Benson who fancied all the ghosts of the dead
dogs were come to testify against him, began to quake
in his shoes; but luckily for all parties, old Pat's pistol
missed fire, which mishap as Pat called it, made him quite
ferocious, and he rushed on the other with intent cer-
tainly to do him some bodily harm, whereupon the by-
standers interfered, and prevented further mischief by
disarming the Irishman and bringing him before the
Justice, by whom he was held to bail in $1000.
   There is no question but the conduct of the Irishman
was quite indefensible, but if, as we heard, the dog killer
took advantage of the absence of the owner to destroy a
favorite and valuable dog, he certainly deserved a cow-
skinning therefor. A difference should be made between
a pack of worthless curs, roaming the streets without
home or owner, and a dog properly taken care of, and
one, too, which was only at large by accident. We are
not quite such abstract constructionists as some people,
thank God!</f>

   P<small>OLICE</small> O<small>FFICE</small>.—<i>An assault with intent to kill</i>.—On Tuesday after-
noon Patrick Collins of No. 360 Madison street, went to the residence
of Gerard Benson, colored man, of No. 341 Madison street and saying,
“you are the man that killed my dog,” presented a large pistol loaded
with powder and ball, snapped it twice at Benson with evident intent
to take life. The pistol did not however go off, when Collins attacked
Benson, with dagger under the muzzle of the pistol, and endeavored
to stab him with it, but was prevented by the bystanders and the pistol
taken from him. It appeared that the dog of Collins had been killed
and Benson being one of those employed, under orders of the Mayor
to kill the dogs, was supposed by Collins to be the one that killed him.
Officer H. B. King arrested Collins, who was committed to prison by
Justice Stevens, but yesterday discharged, on giving bail in $1000 to
answer. Collins is 58 years old, a native of Ireland and a man owing
freehold property.

   G<small>OVERNOR</small> S<small>EWARD</small> W<small>AKED</small> U<small>P</small>.—His Excellency
Wm. H. Seward, Governor of New York, has issued
the following Proclamation:—
<m9>		B<small>Y</small> W<small>ILLIAM</small> H. S<small>EWARD</small>,
	<i>Governor of the State of New York</i>.
		   <b>A Proclamation.</b>
   Whereas Mary C. Rogers, a young woman residing in
the city of New York, was lately ravished and murder-
ed in the said city, or in the portion of the state of New
Jersey contiguous thereto; and whereas the efforts made
by the police of the city of New York to discover the
perpetrators of these crimes have, as appears from the
public prints, proved altogether unsuccessful; and
whereas the peace and security of society require that
such atrocious crimes should not go unpunished:
   Now, therefore, I do hereby declare and make known,
that a reward of seven hundred and fifty dollars will be
paid to whosoever shall give information resulting in the
conviction, either in this state or in the state of New Jer-
sey, of any person guilty of the said crimes.
   And I do hereby enjoin upon all magistrates and other
officers and ministers of justice, that they be diligent in
their efforts to bring the offender or offenders to condign
punishment.
   In testimony whereof, I have caused the privy seal of
	the state to be hereunto affixed, at the city of Al-
 [L. S.] bany, this thirty-first day of August, one thou-
	sand eight hundred and forty-one.
				WILLIAM H. SEWARD.
    By the Governor,
  S<small>AMUEL</small> B<small>LATCHFORD</small>, Private Secretary.</m9>
   Better late than never. This ought to have been
done a month ago, but we suppose it could not be
attended to sooner. It comes from the proper quar-
ter, too. No Governor ever did more to bring the
administration of justice in New York into disre-
pute than Mr. Seward. His high-handed removal
of judges without trial—that of the late Recorder
particularly—his appointment of such old political
hacks as Noah and Lynch—his efforts to disorganize
the municipal government of the city, and to take
away the right of the corporation, have yet to be
atoned for at the bar of public opinion.
   If the present reward, united with that of the peo-
ple's reward, can discover the murderers, we say,
“God speed.”

<d>[Col.3]</d>
   M<small>ORE</small> P<small>RISONERS</small>.—The Police have arrested six or se-
ven young scamps, who are charged with attempting to
ravish a young girl at Hoboken. Not having yet been
informed of the names and particulars of the evidence
against these juvenile soaplocks, of course we are unable
to give them publicity.
   M<small>ORE</small> R<small>OWDYISM</small>.—On Wednesday night, about twelve
o'clock, Captain Fisher, of the Sixth District Watch, was
on duty near Washington market, when he heard a cry
of “watch,” “fire,” and “the Captain” immediately di-
rected two of his subordinates to proceed to the spot and
see what was the matter. The officers could find no fire
or other cause of alarm, but were immediately attacked
by soaplocks, oyster boys, and other longshore loafers.
The Captain immediately advanced to the relief of his
subordinates, and was felled to the ground by a blow on
the head, and also received a stab with a knife, which
proved both deep and dangerous. One of the fellows,
named Mathias Birbank, was immediately apprehended;
subsequently three more of the gang, who gave their
names W. T. Baker, R. Simonson, and John Lowe. They
were all committed, in default of bail.

	THE MARY ROGERS' MYSTERY.
   The whole country is beginning to feel an in-
terest in the brutal violation and murder of Ma-
ry Rogers. Read the following:—
			P<small>HILADELPHIA</small>, Aug. 27, 1841.
   M<small>R.</small> B<small>ENNETT</small>:—The mystery which yet sur-
rounds the terrible case of Miss Rogers, excites
in this community, intense anxiety—the <u title="effects (in Herald)">efforts</u> by
your police to discover the authors of this “mur-
der most foul” are properly estimated, and do re-
ceive merited commendation.
   It has been intimated in your paper of yesterday,
that by persevering efforts the villains will <u title="eventually (in Herald)">event-
fully</u> be brought to punishment, and it is to be
hoped that perseverance will be unremitted.
   Whether you have any recollection or knowl-
edge of a case somewhat similar, which occurred in
N. York, very many years ago, I do not know. It
was that of a certain Levi Weeks, (whose broth-
er, a most estimable man, was then the owner of
the City Hotel.) Levi was charged with the ab-
duction and murder of a Miss Sands, who was ta-
ken from her sister's house in Greenwich street,
conveyed by her lover, to whom she was engaged
to be married, on a cold winter night, and in a
then lonely street, thrown into a well of large
size owned by the Manhattan Company. Being
missed, she was sought for and there found, with
marks of violence on her person, showing great
resistance, and proving the strong efforts made to
preserve herself—her lacerated fingers, &c.
   Now, Sir, the circumstance excited an intense
concern, as does the case of Miss Rogers. So
great was the rush to see the body, that it was
deemed proper to place it in the public street,
where many thousands looked upon it—among
them the writer of this.
   Weeks was arrested—circumstances were ex-
tremely strong against him, and although acquit-
ted by the Jury, public feeling was such that he
left your city and never returned to it—he died a
vagabond.
   Cadwallader D. Colden was then the Attorney
General, and among the witnesses who were in-
troduced for the defendant, was one individual,
whose name I do not now recollect, who was one
of the fatal sleighing party. Mr. Colden was ex-
tremely close in his examination of that man, and
was impressed with a belief that he was the act-
ual murderer.
   Some time afterwards the witness was indict-
ed for committing a forgery—and it was most re-
markable that, in that trial, circumstances were
developed which induced Mr. Colden to say,
“that is the murderer of Miss Sands.”
   It would therefore seem, that despite of all the
machinations of the Devil and his imp, that by a
wise Providence, “murder will out.”
   I refer you to the documents of that day, and
think you may make a good moral use of the facts.
			Yours,			W. C.
   Since the above was written, we have ascer-
tained from Mr. Hyde, the keeper of the city pris-
on, that Archibald W. Padley, was committed to
his custody on the evening of the 27th instant,
by the order of Justice Parker; that Padley stands
charged with the abduction, rape, and murder of
Mary Cecilia Rogers. If the examination, or the
grounds for the accusation and imprisonment of
this person are ever made public, we suppose that
the mystery of <i>the rose</i> will be explained, and the
probabilities ascertained of Mary Rogers having
visited Crommelin on the Sunday, after she cal-
led on Payne. From the first we have called at-
tention to this circumstance.—<i>N. Y. Herald</i>.

   M<small>URDER OF</small> M<small>ISS</small> R<small>OGERS</small>.—Archibald W. Pad-
ley, who had before made a voluntary statement to
the Police Magistrate, was brought up again on
Saturday, at the instance of Justice Parker, touch-
ing the murder of Miss Rogers, and on being yes-
terday examined, and nothing appearing to impli-
cate him in the remotest degree he was discharged.

	<b>The Case of Mary C. Rogers.</b>
   The Planet—a penny paper—of this morning
tells a strange story about this young lady. It as-
serts that a letter was received in this city yester-
day, from <u>Pittsburg</u>, the writer of which alleges
that he had just seen and conversed with Miss Ro-
gers there, in company with a Mr. Getchell, to
whom she was supposed to be married. That she
told him she had left New York clandestinely, be-
cause her mother urged her to marry a man she
did not like, and that she was going to an uncle in
Illinois. Farther that she had left a letter on the
table addressed to her mother, telling her of the
course she was about to take, &c.
   The Planet says that Mr. Crommelin, on seeing
the letter (the one from Pittsburgh,) set off imme-
diately for Illinois; and that Mrs. Rogers denies
having found any letter from Mary.
   This is a strange and improbable story; and
there is so much <u title="recklessness">recklesness</u>, in some of the pa-
pers, about making statements on doubtful authori-
ty, or none at all, no matter how grave the sub-
ject, that we cannot but hesitate in giving to it the
least particle of credence. If it were true some of
the other morning papers would, we think, have
had some notice of it.
   There is one circumstance, perhaps, that might
be cited in corroboration of the Pittsburgh letter,
which, from the first, has often caused us to doubt
as to her murder. Some two or three years ago,
while in attendance upon the segar-shop of Mr.
Anderson, Miss Rogers was abducted, or went in
to concealment that it might be believed she had
been abducted, in order to create excitement and
help the sale of the goods of her employer. After
<d>[Col.5]</d>
the smoking of the extra segars sold during the ex-
citement had cleared away, the young woman re-
turned as good as new.—<i>N. Y. Com. Adv.</i>

   T<small>HE</small> M<small>ARY</small> R<small>OGERS</small> M<small>YSTERY</small>.—It was currently
reported on Saturday, that the shawl and parasol be-
longing to this poor girl, had been discovered in a
tavern at Weehawken. One of the corps of inde-
fatigables immediately started to the place, but
what discoveries he made there, remains to be told.

   T<small>HE</small> T<small>WO</small> J<small>UDGES OF THE</small> S<small>ESSIONS</small>—N<small>OVEL</small> P<small>RO-
CEEDINGS</small>.—We stated the other day that Noah and
Lynch, the two Judges of the Sessions, had given
special instructions to the District Attorney to bring
several prosecutions against the members of the
Common Council, for giving negative votes in the
Board of Supervisors, on the salaries of these two
learned men. The following is an authentic copy of
this precious document:—
<m9>				“N<small>EW</small> Y<small>ORK</small>, Aug. 14, 1841.
“F<small>REDERICK</small> R. L<small>EE</small>, Esq.
	D<small>EAR</small> S<small>IR</small>:—
   “James Lynch, Esq., one of the Associate Judges of
the Court of Sessions has entered a complaint against
you for refusing to vote in favor of paying his bill for
salary as such Judge, at a meeting of the Board of Su-
pervisors, held in this city on the 9th of July last.
   “The statute imposes a penalty of $250 on every super-
visor who shall 'neglect or refuse to perform any of the
duties which shall be required of him by that law.'
1 R. S. 361.
   “By the act of Sessions Laws, 1831, 64 session, p. 26,
sec. 4 the Legislature says the salary of those Judges
shall be a county charge, and the supervisors 'shall au-
dit and allow the account for such arrears and on or be-
fore the 10th day of July.' The Statute, also 1 R. S. p.
375, sec. 102, makes it my duty to prosecute for the
penalty.
   “Your early attention is called to this matter, and as I
suppose the complaint to be made with no disposition
other than to enforce the payment of the salary claimed,
you will please inform me by an early day whether any
measures will be taken to audit the accounts which will
be satisfactory to the Judge.
			Respectfully yours,
						J. R. WHITING.”</m9>
   In addition to the penalty of $250, the District At-
torney can also procure indictments for misdemean-
ors against each of the refractory Aldermen, for
their negative votes—and one committee can punish
these gentlemen each in a fine of $500 or imprison-
ment, probably at Blackwell's Island, for six <u title="calender">calan-
der</u> months each.
   When Judge Lynch illustrated the law of <i>habeas
corpus</i> by his repeated decisions of that ancient writ,
every body thought he was a wonderfully learned
functionary—but the series of proceedings now be-
gun surpasses the whole history of law or cock-
fighting, from the time of Cain and Abel to the pre-
sent age. It would seem that Judge Lynch takes
the responsibility on himself, without the helping
hand of his brother in tribulation, Judge Noah—but
we know the character of the latter too well to <u title="imagine">ima-
jine</u> that this movement did not originate in his fer-
tile mind, and now receives his ready concurrence.
   This affair is the funniest thing that ever took
place in the criminal affairs of New York, and has
the same character of good natured absurdity which
have recently distinguished the long rigmarole arti-
cles on city affairs, published in the “Evening Star,”
on which Judge Noah hast yet a mortgage of $7000,
and therefore controls its columns. As a practical
joke it beats any thing in Joe Miller, and we hope it
will be carried out, to the very digging of stone on
Blackwell's Isle.
   We, therefore, beg the Recorder to take up the
subject himself in his charge to the Grand Jury,
which meets to-day, on the opening of the Court of
Sessions. This is too rich a movement to hand over
to Lynch and Noah. The indictment of nine or ten
locofoco aldermen, for presuming to vote against the
salaries of Lynch and Noah, is a very important
matter—and ought to form the staple of his charge.
Go ahead. Ten aldermen on Blackwell's Island
getting out stone—instead of oysters and <u title="champagne">champaigne</u>
—what a rich sight!</f>

			POLICE—Yesterday.
   <i>The case of Mary C. Rogers</i>.—The spot at which
this unfortunate girl lost her life, is believed to have
been discovered. A little boy living at Weehawken
brought some days since to his mother, a hat tassel
which he found in the woods or bushes in the neigh-
borhood, and some other articles of female apparel.
Information of this having reached the Mayor, he vi-
sited the mother, was shown by the boy to the place,
and there found other pieces of her clothes and indi-
cations around of a violent struggle having taken
place. In consequence of this discovery, the follow-
ing notice has been issued by the Mayor, to which
we invite public attention. We would further sug-
gest that the Governor should, in addition to the pe-
cuniary reward offered for the discovery of the perpe-
trators of this atrocious act, promise a pardon to any
informer, who though present, was not actually a
party to it.

   The Mayor desires to see all persons of either sex
who were on Sunday afternoon, 25th of July last,

C<small>HARGE TO THE</small> G<small>RAND</small> J<small>URY</small>.—We are happy to
perceive that Recorder Tallmadge has brought the
present condition of the police system to the notice
of the Grand Jury. There is some more sense indi-
cated in this movement, than we could find in the
charges of Lynch or Noah.
   The police system of this city requires a full in-
vestigation—and a complete reform. The same
may be said of the fire department, which seems to
be in a state of insurrection all the time. In these
important municipal systems, no change has taken
place since the population of New York numbered
10,000 or 20,000 inhabitants. Having now a popu-
lation of nearly <i>half a million</i>, it is utterly impossible
that the peace of the city can be maintained, or
crime prevented, under the present system. We
trust the Grand Jury will suit the matter thoroughly.
The Recorder may now to dinner.

public meetings at once, and get the corporation to
move.

   All Buffalo is alive for the ceremonies to-mor-

the protection of the American Constitution. Noah
is named Governor and Judge of Israel. The Mili-
tary and Masonic procession will take place in this
village, and the ceremonies in St. Paul's Church.
The town is filled with Indians—Red Jacket will be

   C<small>ITY OF</small> R<small>EFUGE</small>.
   It was known at the sale of that beautiful and
valuable tract called Grand Island, a few miles be-
low this port, in the Niagara River, that it was pur-
chased, in part, by the friends of Mayor Noah, of
New York, [Jacob Barker, William Leggett, and
other large financiers of that day] avowedly to offer
it as an asylum for his brethren of the Jewish per-
suasion, who in the other parts of the world are
much oppressed; and it was likewise known that it
was intended to erect upon the Island a city called
Ararat. We are gratified to perceive, by the docu-
ments in this day's Extra, that, coupled with that
<u title="colonization (in Eve.Post)">colinization</u>, is a declaration of independence, and
the revival of the Jewish Government,under the
protection of the United Sates, after the disper-
sion of that ancient and wealthy people, for nearly
two thousand years, and the appointment of Mr. M.
M. Noah as first Judge. It was intended, pursuant
to public notice, to celebrate the event on the Island,
and a flag-staff was erected for the Grand Standard
of Israel, and other arrangements made; but it was
discovered that a sufficient number of boats could
not be procured in time to convey all those to the
Island who were desirous of witnessing the ceremo-
ny, and the celebration took place this day in the
village, which was both interesting and impressive.
At dawn of day, a salute was fired in front of the
Court House, and from the terrace facing the Lake.
At 10 o'clock the masonic and military companies
assembled in front of the Lodge, and at eleven the
line of procession was formed as follows:

<m9>   O<small>RDER OF</small> C<small>ELEBRATION</small>.—Music, military, citizens,
civil officers, State officers in uniform, U. S. officers, Pre-
sident and Trustees of the Corporation, tyler, stewards,
entered apprentices, fellow crafts, master masons, seni-
or and junior deacons, secretary and treasurer, senior
and junior wardens, master of lodges, past masters, reve-
rend clergy, stewards with corn, wine and oil.

Bible, square and compass, borne by a master mason, the
Judge of Israel in black, wearing the judicial robes of
crimsoned silk, trimmed with ermine, and a richly em-
bossed golden medal, suspended from the neck; [it was
a tragedy dress borrowed of the Park Theatre;] a master
mason, royal arch masons, knight templars.</m9>

   On arriving at the church door, the troops opened
to the right and left, and the procession entered the
aisles, the band playing the grand march from Ju-
das <u title="Maccabeus (in Eve.Post)">Maccabees</u>. The full toned organ commenced
its swelling notes, performing the Jubilate. On the
communion table lay the Corner Stone, with the
following inscription, in Hebrew:
<m9><span style="border:dotted .4em;display:inline-block;padding:.2em">   “Hear, O, Israel, the Lord is our God.—The Lord is
one.” Ararat, the Hebrew refuge, founded by Mordecai
Manuel Noah, in the month of Tisri, <u title="5586 ?">5585</u>, corresponding
with September, 1825, and in the 50th year of American
Independence.</span></m9>
On the stone lay the silver cups with wine, corn and
oil. The ceremonies commenced by the morning
service, read emphatically by the Rev. Mr. Searl, of
the Episcopal Church. “Before Jehovah's awful
Throne,” was sung by the choir to the tune of Old
Hundred. Morning prayer—first lesson from Jere-
miah, 31st. Second lesson, <u title="Zeph. (in Eve.Post")>Zep.</u> iii., 8th verse.—

   The following is the proclamation, which will be
read with great attention and interest. A finer day
and more general satisfaction, has not been known
on any similar occasion.
		P<small>ROCLAMATION TO THE</small> J<small>EWS</small>.
   Whereas, it has pleased Almighty God, to manifest to
his chosen people the approach of that period when, in
fulfilment of the promises made to the race of Jacob,
	...
Therefore, I, Mordecai Manuel Noah, citizen of the
United States of America, late consul of the said States
for the city and kingdom of Tunis, High Sheriff of New
York, Counsellor-at-Law, and by the Grace of God, Go-
vernor and Judge of Israel, have issued this my procla-
mation,
   Announcing to the Jews throughout the world, that an
asylum is prepared and hereby offered to them, where
they can enjoy that peace, comfort and happiness, which
has been denied them, through the intolerance and mis-
government of former ages; an asylum in a free and
powerful country, where ample protection is secured
<u title="to their (in Eve.Post)">their</u> persons, their property, and religious rights; an
asylum in a country remarkable for its vast resources,
the richness of its soil, and the salubrity of its climate;
where industry is encouraged, education promoted, and
good faith rewarded; “a land of milk and honey,” where
Israel may repose in peace, under his “vine and fig tree,”
and where our people may so familiarize themselves
with the science of government, and the lights of learning
and civilization, as may qualify them for that great and
final restoration to their ancient heritage which the
times so powerfully indicate.
   The asylum referred to is in the State of New York,
the greatest State in the American confederacy. New
York contains 43,214 square miles, divided into fifty-five
counties, and having six hundred and eighty seven port
towns and cities, containing one million five hundred
thousand inhabitants, together with six million acres of
	...
   The desired spot in the State of New York, to which I
hereby invite my beloved people throughout the world,
in common with those of every religious denomination,
is called Grand Island, and on which I shall lay the foun-
dation of a City of Refuge, to be called Ararat. Grand
Island, in the Niagara river, is bounded by Ontario on
the north; and Erie on the south, and within a few miles
of each of those great commercial lakes. The island is</m9>
<d>[Col.3]</d>
<m9>nearly twelve miles in length, and varying from three to
seven miles in breadth, and contains upwards of seven-
teen thousand acres of remarkably rich and fertile land.
	...
   Deprived as our people have been for centuries of a
right in the soil, they will learn with peculiar satisfac-
tion, that here they can till the land, reap the harvest,
and raise the flocks which are unquestionably their
own; and in the full unmolested enjoyment of their
religious rights, and of every civil immunity, together
with peace and plenty, they can lift up their voice in
gratitude to Him, who sustained our fathers in the wil-
derness, and brought us in triumph out of the land of
Egypt; who assigned to us the safe keeping of his ora-
cles; who proclaimed us his people, and who has ever
walked before us “like a cloud by day and pillar of fire
by night.”
   In His name do I revive, renew and re-establish the
government of the Jewish nation, under the auspices
and protection of the constitution and laws of the United
States of America, confirming and perpetuating all our
rights and privileges, our name, our rank, and our
power, among the nations of the earth as they existed
and were recognized under the government of the
Judges. And I hereby enjoin it upon all our pious and
venerable <u title="As in Eve.Post">rabbi's</u>, our presidents and elders of syna-
gogues, chiefs of colleges, and brethren in authority
throughout the world, to circulate and make known this
my proclamation, and to give to it full publicity, credence,
and effect.
   It is my will that a census of the Jews throughout the
world be taken, and returns of persons, together with
their age and occupation, be registered in the archives of
the synagogues where they are accustomed to worship,
	...
   I command that a strict neutrality be observed in the
pending war between the Greeks and Turks, enjoined
by consideration of safety towards a numerous popula-
tion of Jews now under the oppressive dominion of the
<u title="Ottoman (in Eve.Post)">Ottomon</u> Porte.
	...
   I abolish forever Polygamy among the Jews, which,
without religious warrant, still exists in Asia and Africa.
	...
   A capitation tax of three shekels in silver per annum,
or one Spanish dollar, is hereby levied upon each Jew
throughout the world, to be collected by the treasurers
of the different congregations, for the purpose of defraying
the various expenses of re-organizing the government, of
aiding emigrants in the purchase of agricultural instru-
ments, providing for their immediate wants and comforts,
	...
glory of the Jewish nation. A Judge of Israel shall be
chosen once in every four years by the Consistory at
Paris, at which time proxies from every congregation
shall be received.
   I do hereby name as commissioners, the most learned
and pious Abraham de Cologna, Knight of the Iron
Crown of Lombardy, Grand Rabbi of the Jews, and
President of the Consistory of Paris, like the Grand
Rabbi Andrade of Bordeaux, and also our estimable
Grand Rabbis of the German and Portugal Jews, in Lon-
don, Rabbis Herschell and Mendoza, together with the
	...
   I do appoint Roshodes Adar, Feb.7, 1826, to be observed
with suitable demonstrations, as a day of thanksgiving
to the Lord God of Israel, for the manifold blessings and
	...
   Given at Buffalo, in the State of New York, this <u title="third ?">second</u>
day of Tisri, in the year of the world, 5586, correspond-
ing with the 15th day of <u title="September">Sestember</u>, 1825, and in the fif-
tieth year of American Independence.
			By the Judge,
						<u title="Absent in Eve.Post">M. M. NOAH,</u>
   A. B. S<small>EIXAS</small>, Secretary <i>pro tem</i>.</m9>

   This religious revelation, so well arranged, did not
succeed at the time, because it was rather too early
in the field, and because the Jews are a stiff-necked
people, and want faith. But if Mr. Noah had per-
sisted in his purpose—exhibited the enthusiasm and
devotion of Jo Smith—of Margaret Bishop—we have
not the slightest doubt but he would become a much
better prophet and Judge in <u title="Israel">Isreal</u>, than a political
editor, or a Christian Judge. Every great genius
in religious movements must possess unbounded
faith in himself—irrepressible enthusiasm in his pur-
suit—and great energy in effort. Mr. Noah was too
soon discouraged, and accordingly Jo Smith, with
less general knowledge, but more moral courage,
started on a like plan, a few years afterwards, in
Canandaigua, and originated the great Mormon
movement, which bids fair to be the most prosperous
that ever arose toward the setting of the sun. But
there is no reason why the Book of <u title="Jasher ?">Jashar</u> should
not beat the Book of <u title="Mormon ?">Morman</u> out of the field, and in
the movement recently made in Philadelphia, by a
new religious union, among the ancient people of
God, we trust that the Hebrews of this city will ap-
point Mr. Noah their delegate, and thus give him an
opportunity to overtake the great Mormon prophet,
or at least catch up to the apron strings of Margaret
Bishop, and hold on fast during the race for immor-
tality.
   We desire all our religious, as well as irreli-
gious readers, to watch and pray. In the present
agitated state of the moral, financial, and political
world, we may expect some new and profound re-
<d>[Col.4]</d>
velation, that may set this wicked world once more
on its legs. We want an earthquake, a tornado, a
volcanic eruption, or some terrible commotion of
the moral, religious and social elements, to set all
things to right again.

VELOPMENTS</small> C<small>OMING</small>.—On the subject of the murder
of Mary Rogers, we have received the following no-
tice from the Police:—
<m9>				P<small>OLICE</small> O<small>FFICE</small>, <i>Sept.</i> 5<i>th</i>, 1841.
   S<small>IR</small>: I am requested by the magistrate of the Lower
P. O. to request you to suspend the publication of any
thing relative to the murder of Mary C. Rogers, for the
present. The reason will be given to your reporter to-
morrow.
		Respectfully, yours
				B. W. OSBORN, Clerk.
   J<small>AMES</small> G<small>ORDON</small> B<small>ENNETT</small>, Esq.</m9>
   Most certainly we will, although we know all the
horrible facts which have recently been discovered,
by, as it were, the interposition of Providence—facts
which will lead to the certain discovery of the per-
petrators of that horrid butchery. The evidence
and inferences of the eminent physician of Hoboken,
Dr. Cook, are all confirmed beyond the possibility of
a doubt. When we are permitted, we will lift the
veil, and show scenes of blood and brutality, that
will make the hair stand on end. The precise lo-
cality of the violation and murder is now known—
and her beastly murderers cannot escape. A young
boy of Weehawken, in wandering through a thicket
one day last week, came upon a spot where a wo-
man's petticoat, parasol, pieces of her dress, and poc-
ket handkerchief were found. It was in the centre of
a thick grove, a short distance from the river. He
gave notice of the facts to his mother—the mother
to the coroner or justice of Hoboken. On Saturday
and Sunday last, the Mayor and District Attorney,
in company with Doctor Cook and others, examined
the ground. They found three pieces of dress
which had belonged to Mary, besides other evidences
of murder—traces of blood—and the rails of the
fences, down to the water's edge, had been re-
moved or broken down, so as to take the body, when
the poor girl was dead, to the river.
   Other facts are known of equal importance, but it
is now beyond a doubt that Mary Rogers was forced
across the river in a boat, and violated and murder-
ed by the crew of that boat. Let the Police move.
The Mayor has issued the following:—
<m9>			<b>Advertisement.</b>
   ☞ The M<small>AYOR</small> desires to see all persons of either sex

last meeting were read and approved.

   A communication was received from an individual,
asking for the office of “Reporter of Aliens.” Referred
to Committee on Applications to Office.
   <i>Resolutions</i>.—Whereas great excitement has been crea-
ted in this city, in consequence of the outrage and mur-
der of Mary C. Rogers; therefore, a reward, at the dis-
cretion of the Mayor, be offered for the apprehension of
the murderer or murderers.
   Alderman <u>Baylis</u> moved to fill the blank with $1000.
   Alderman Purdy thought it was too large a sum, con-
sidering that a committee of citizens had offered a re-
ward of $600, which, with the sum offered by the Gov-
ernor, now made the reward $1,350.
   Alderman Woodhull said the Mayor was opposed to
the object of this resolution. His Honor was now in
communication with the Governor of New Jersey, on
the subject of the outrage, and with great hopes of effect-
ing some discoveries.
   Alderman Kimball was willing to leave the matter to
the discretion of his Honor the Mayor.
   Alderman Purdy thought a reasonable reward should
be offered, and therefore moved to make the reward
$500.
   Alderman Benson thought it was indirect censure on
his Honor the Mayor, who had been most active in his
attempts to ferret out the guilty. His Honor had now
the power to offer $500, if he thought it expedient so
to do.
   The question was taken on the passage of the <u title="resolution ?">re-
solutions</u>, and lost, six voting in the affirmative, and
ten in the negative.

lin, Vandervoort, Leonard, Hatfield, Bradhurst, Timpson,

			<small>RESOLUTIONS.</small>
   By Ald. Balis—Whereas, great excitement has prevailed
in this community and elsewhere, in consequence of a most
fiendlike outrage and subsequent murder of Mary C. Rogers
of this city; and whereas, this atrocious, brutal and bloody
transaction is enveloped in so much mystery, that the ma-
gistrates and officers of police have thus far been unsuc-
cessful in discovering the perpetrator or perpetrators:
Therefore,
   Resolved, (if the board of Assistants concur,) That His
Honor the Mayor, be directed to issue his proclamation, of-
fering a reward of $500 for the apprehension and conviction
of the person or persons guilty of the violation of the
person and murder of Mary C. Rogers—which was reject-
ed.

   THE CASE OF MISS ROGERS.
   The Planet—a penny paper—of this
morning tells a strange story about this
young lady. It asserts that a letter was
received in this city yesterday, from
Pittsburgh, the writer of which alleges
that he had just seen and conversed with
Miss Rogers there, in company with a
Mr. Getchell, to whom she was supposed
to be married. That she told him she
had left New York clandestinely, be-
cause her mother urged her to marry a
man she did not like, and that she was
going to an uncle in Illinois. Farther
that she had left a letter on the table
addressed to her mother, telling her of
the course she was about to take, &c.
   The Planet says that Mr. Crommelin,
on seeing the letter (the one from Pitts-
burgh,) set off immediately for Illinois;
and Mrs. Rogers denies having found
any letter from Mary.
   This is a strange and improbable sto-
ry; and there is so much recklessness,
in some of the papers, about making
statements on doubtful authority, or none
at all, no matter how grave the subject,
that we cannot but hesitate in giving to
it the least particle of credence. If it
were true some of the other morning pa-
pers would, we think, have had some
notice of it.
   We may as well add here that the
Tattler has, within the last few days,
argued at length in support of the hy-
pothesis that the body found in the river
was not the body of Miss Rogers. We
can discover little or no force in its rea-
sonings.
   The identification of the clothing worn
by Mis Rogers with that found on the
body was, and still is considered perfect
and conclusive.
   Perhaps the strongest argument a-
gainst the conclusion of the Tattler is
the fact that no other young woman but
Miss Rogers has disappeared in an un-
accountable manner.
   There is one circumstance, perhaps,
that might be cited in corroboration of
the Pittsburgh letter, which, from the
first, has often caused us to doubt as to
her murder. Some two or three years
ago, while in attendance upon the segar
shop of Mr. Anderson, Miss Rogers was
abducted, or went in to concealment, that
it might be believed she had been ab-
ducted, in order to create excitement
and help the sale of the goods of her em-
ployer. After the smoke of the extra
segars sold during the excitement had
cleared away, the young woman return-
ed as good as new.—<i>N. Y. Com. Adv.</i>

   <i>Another Arrest for the Murder of Miss Rog-
ers</i>.—A person by the name of A. W. Padley,
was arrested in New York on Monday, charg-
ed with abduction, rape and murder of Mary
C. Rogers. The New York Tattler says:—
   Mr. Padley is the man who testified to see-
ing the rose in Mr. Crommelin's door, and the
name of Mary on Mr. Crommelin's slate. He
professed to identify the body and to corrob-
orate all Mr. Crommelin's statements. He is
the person who testifies to the last trace of
Mary. His silence since the affair <i>seemed</i> to
have been settled, is a strong circumstance
against him.
   The Grand Jury, who meet next week, will
unquestionably act upon the matter; and when
the trial or examination of Mr. Padley comes
up, Mr. Crommelin will have a chance for show-
ing the character of his connexion, as a wit-
ness in the case. Let us have no more star-
chamber work.
   We trust that the public are now satisfied
that Venetian police examinations amount to
nothing. We hope that Mr. Justice Taylor
will be cited, as a witness, to say what result-
ed from his examination of Mrs. Rogers at her
house. We expect also to find out, whether
Mrs. Rogers ever saw any part of the clothing,
said to be Mary's, except what was carried to
her by Mr. Crommelin, on the morning after
the discovery.

   A<small>NOTHER</small> McL<small>EOD</small> W<small>AR</small>.—One would sup-
pose that with the abundance of food for excite-
ment which prevails at present, the “rumor” mon-
gers might get along without turning aside as of-
ten as once a month to frighten our poor old
grand-mothers with a fresh declaration of war
against McLeod. Can they not find enough to sa-
tisfy their greedy appetites for the marvellous in
the steamboat burnings, the powder explosions,
the murder of Mary <u>Rodgers</u>, the fights of the
firemen, the hubbub at Washington, the vetoes,
debates, denunciations, burnings in effigy, break-
ing up of old cabinets and forming new ones, the
intrigues, “plots and counter-plots” that are in
progress?
	...
   In the midst of all these signs and wonders,
both in heaven and on earth, we can only pray
that the nerves of our good old grand-mothers
may be strengthened not only to hear these terri-
ble tidings, but to look calmly on the catastrophe
that is to follow. We have not the least doubt
that America will be invaded by thousands of
Britons in less than six months. But let us not
be alarmed. They will only come to help culti-
vate our fields and eat their bread in peace where
no barbarous corn laws will grasp one half of

   A<small>RREST OF</small> L<small>ETT</small>.—The Buffalo papers bring in-
formation of the arrest of Lett, the incendiary, for
whom Governor Seward has recently offered a large
reward. He was taken in Buffalo, by Constables
Gates, Pierce, Smith, Best and <u title="Bottum, Burton (elsewhere)">Bottom</u>, on board of
the steamboat Daniel Webster. When accosted by
the police, he made an attempt to escape, by draw-
ing his knife and threatening to kill the first man
who dared to approach him, but he was speedily dis-
armed and ironed. This Lett, it will be recollect-
ed, was tried in June, 1840, at Oswego, for an at-
tempt to set fire to the steamboat Great Britain,
when she was filled with passengers on one of her
usual trips. He was convicted on the clearest tes-
timony and sentenced to imprisonment in the state
prison, and while on his way there, under charge
of the deputy sheriff, escaped from the car in which
he was conveyed. He has since been at large not-
withstanding the efforts made to retake him.

   S<small>COUNDRELISM</small>.—Some scoundrel placed two logs
of timber across the track of New Jersey Rail-

disaster. The mail train from Philadelphia, which
was full of passengers, was going fortunately with no
great speed when they struck against the logs; and
the engineer having immediately chocked his engine,
succeeded in preventing the train from being thrown
off the track. The cow-fender in front, though fas-
tened down with an iron bolt, was raised up by the
violence of the blow, the timber being forced un-
der it.

		CAPTURE OF LETT.
   I have the satisfaction of informing you that the
desperate Lett was this morning captured in this city
by constables Gates, Pierce, Smith, Best and <u title="Bottom, Burton (elsewhere)">Bottum</u>,
and is now safely lodged in jail. Information was last
night communicated to Gates, that he was seen to go on
board the Daniel Webster, one of the steamboats laid
up, and which is moored some distance up the creek.—
Arrangements were concerted by the police to meet at
the boat at the same time from different ways, when
they made a rush into the cabin, where they found him
quietly eating his breakfast with a man named Hinton,
keeper of the boat. He immediately ran to a state
room, seized his bowie knife, and threatened death to
the first man who laid hands upon him. One of the con-
stables quietly told him that they had come to take him,
and take him they should, either dead or alive. While
one was in the act of seizing him, he made a pass with
his knife, but his arm was arrested by the others; when
he was disarmed, ironed, and safely secured.<f>
   The bodies of the unfortunate sufferers by the Erie
continue to come in—over 100 have been recovered.—

<m9>		Correspondence of the Tribune.
Extract of a letter to the Editors, dated B<small>UFFALO</small>, Sept. 6, 1841.</m9>
   <i>Gentlemen</i>: The notorious <i>Lett</i>, concerning whom you
have heard so much, and for whose apprehension the Gov-
ernor recently offered a considerable reward, was apprehen-
ded in this city this morning, and is now secure in our jail
He was taken on board of one of the steamboats that is laid
up in the harbor. It was ascertained, some time since, that
Lett was occasionally in this city, on his way between the
Eastern and Western frontiers; and a watch was therefore
kept for him. On this occasion it is said he had just arrived
from Lewiston, and at the moment of his capture was seated
at breakfast, with the keeper of the boat. There were five
or six concerned in the capture, which was the result of a
surprise that they had planned, and executed without concert
with any one else. They had arranged and timed their
movements so as to approach the steamboat from different
points, and to arrive upon her deck at the same instant.
Lett, on seeing them, sprang for his weapons, but seeing so
many upon him, and being told that resistance could avail
him nothing, he submitted to be ironed.<f>
   Within the last three days great number of the bodies of
the victims of the late steamboat Erie have been brought to

			<b>Lett in the State Prison.</b>
	Correspondence of the Tribune.
					A<small>UBURN</small>, Sept. 7, 1841.
   <i>Dear Sir</i>: <u title="Benjamin (elsewhere)">Alexander</u> Lett, of Canadian notoriety, was
this day consigned to a place within the walls of the State
Prison in this place. You may remember he was convicted
in Oswego a year ago last June for an attempt to blow up
one of the steamboats in Oswego harbor as she was about
leaving the wharf, and sentenced to the Auburn State Prison
for seven years. On his way here, when within three miles,
he jumped from the cars (during the night) and escaped.—
He has been wandering about in this State and Canada from
that time to this.
   On Sunday he crossed from Waterloo to Buffalo and was
secreted in the steamboat Daniel Webster. These facts
were made known to the authorities at Buffalo, and five Con-
stables on Monday came on him so suddenly while he was
in the lady's cabin, that he was not able to seize upon any of
his arms, consisting of a seven-shooter, pistols, dirks, &c.;
he was immediately lodged in jail, and within two hours
was on his way here. He had hopes of escaping on his
way, till he arrived within sight of Auburn, when he gave up.
He will now do the State some service in making silk. He
is well capacitated to be the leader of a desperate set of
men—not over five feet ten but every inch a man. A wild and
desperate eye, an expansive forehead, but thin face, high
cheek bones, with a head covered with fiery red hair, sur-
mounted upon a long neck well supported by a powerful
chest, and shoulders. He was betrayed by some of his as-
sociates. The large reward offered by the Governor and
Sheriff of Oswego was too tempting. Their patriotism gave
way at the sight of the glittering bait; the Governor visited
the prison this afternoon and conversed with him as to his
design, &c.			Yours, &c.				M.

		CAPTURE OF LETT.
   It gives us great pleasure to announce the capture
of this notorious villain, and we not only hope that
proper care will be taken to keep him in custody
now that he is once more in the hands of the law,
but that measures will be taken to add such punish-
ment as is called for by his last act of violence.—
Seven years imprisonment is a very inadequate mea-
sure of punishment for such a wretch. Seven years
more for the attempt to murder the officers will be
none too heavy a retribution. The following parti-
culars of his arrest are from the Buffalo Commer-
cial Advertiser of Monday last:
   “This desperado was captured this morning, and
is safely lodged in jail. The police learned that he
was lurking about the city, and last night constable
Gates got upon his track, and saw him go on board
the Webster, one of the steamboats laid up. A plan
of operations was immediately concerned, and this
morning constables Gates, Pierce, Smith, Best and
<u title="Bottum, Bottom (elsewhere)">Burton</u> carried it into execution. They divided into
two parties, met on the boat precisely at the minute
fixed upon, and made a rush into the ladies cabin,
where Lett, in company with a man named Hinton,
the keeper of the boat, was quietly seated eating his
breakfast. He ran into an adjoining state room,
seized a Bowie knife, and threatened with death the
first man who approached him. The constables told
him resistance was useless, they had come to take
him, dead or alive, and would. One seized his arm
as he was making a blow, the others sprang upon
and disarmed him, the handcuffs were put on, and
in spite of all his resistance, he was forthwith lodg-
ed in jail, and the Sheriff's certificate of <u title="deposit">deposite</u>
taken.”
   P. S. We have since received the Auburn Journal,
by which paper we learn that Lett has been duly de-
posited in the State Prison, and there, in our opinion,
he ought to remain at hard labor during the remain-
der of his life, unless it should be deemed in the mean
time that he better deserves hanging.

lieved that the “Tribune,” a rival penny paper,
started by a <i>clique</i> of politicians, has made serious
inroads upon its prosperity and business. We have
heard the increase of the Tribune stated at 10,000
circulation, and the decrease of the Sun to be as
much—perchance more. It is difficult to ascertain
the accurate circulation of the “Sun” in the city,
because it is generally taken by the poorer classes—
and it is got up so cheaply, for it is principally made
up of stale news, a day or two old—that its proprie-
tor a very money making man, can get nearly as
much for his paper from the grocers to tie up tea
and sugar with, as he gets from his carriers to serve
their subscribers. The quantity of the Sun that may
be printed, and its actual business circulation, was
very many thousands. In this respect, the Tribune
differs. It is read and perused by those who take it
for its news and its opinions. These opinions are
corrupt and rotten—and spring from bank specula-
tors, office-beggars—but still they have their advo-
cates. The Tribune who generally gives the latest
news—a thing which is entirely neglected by the
Sun till the next day. This has given the Tribune
another advantage over the Sun.
   But both and all such papers would seem to be
destined to be superseded by the new “Penny Press”
which is large in size—conducted with great spirit—
not tinctured with party—beyond the reach of <i>cliques</i>
—and just such a penny paper as will merit the sup-
port of any intelligent community.

<u title="board">boord</u> the steamer D. Webster, lying up the creek.
He was engaged playing cards, and intended to
go on some boat up the Lake after dark, as they all
start at eight o'clock. He was well armed, but no
less than four of our police were on to him before he
could defend himself. He is now safely lodged in the
jail here. As soon as the news from New York ar-
rived last evening, there was at least twenty specula-

present rise of flour. The steamboats are daily
bringing in dead bodies of those who were lost in
the Erie. Time is up to close mail.

   In such wise does the official journal of this State,
the Albany Evening Journal, speak of a desperado,
who, actuated by a malice nothing less than diaboli-
cal, endeavored to destroy by fire the steamboat
<i>Great Britain</i>, then full of passengers,—of whom
many could not have failed to become victims, if the
attempt had been successful.
   He who embarks in rebellion knows before-hand
that he must do so with a halter round his neck; and
to seek to palliate acts of midnight murder and ar-
son, by the severities exercised towards a fugitive
conspirator, is to confound all sentiment of right and
wrong.
   Especially at such a juncture as the present, does
the lenient, not to say admiring, tone of the official
paper of New York, towards such a scoundrel, seem
to us most misplaced.

   R<small>IOT AND</small> M<small>OBS</small>, C<small>ONFUSION AND</small> B<small>LOODSHED</small>.—
This city has been in the most alarming condition
for several days—and from about 8 o'clock on Fri-
day evening until about 3 o'clock yesterday morn-
ing, almost entirely at the mercy of a law-
less mob, ranging in number from two to three
hundred. Amidst the confusion of such a state of
things, it is almost impossible to collect a full or
accurate state of facts. But with deep regret, and
acknowledged humiliation, we detail what happen-
ed as well as we can.
   On Tuesday evening last, as we are informed, a
quarrel took place near the corner of Sixth street
and Broadway, between a party of Irishmen and
some negroes, in which blows were exchanged,
and other weapons, if not firearms, used. Some
two or three of such party were wounded. On
Wednesday night the quarrel was renewed in some
way, and sometime after midnight, a party of ex-
cited men, armed with clubs, &c., attacked a house
occupied as a negro boarding house on <u title="Macalester (in Hazard's Register)">McAlister</u>
street, demanding the surrender of a negro, who
they said had fled into the house, and was there
secreted, and uttering the most violent threats a-
gainst the house, and the negroes in general. Se-
veral of the adjoining houses were occupied by ne-
gro families, including a number of women and
children. The violence increased and was resist-
ed by those in and about the houses—and engage-
ment took place—several were wounded on each
side—and some say guns or pistols were discharged
from the house. The interference of some gentle-
men in the neighborhood, succeeded in restoring
quiet after about three-fourths of an hour, when a
watchman appeared. But it is singular that this
violent street disturbance, elicited no report to the
police, nor arrest—indeed that the Mayor remain-
ed ignorant of the affair, until late in the day, when
he casually heard of it.
   On Thursday night another rencontre took place
in the neighborhood of the Lower Market, between
some young men and boys, and some negroes, in
which one or two of the boys were badly wounded,
as was supposed, with knives—how the negroes
fared, we did not learn.
   On Friday, during the day, there was considera-
ble excitement; threats of violence and lawless
outbreaks were indicated in various ways, and came
to the ear of the police, and of the negroes. At-
tacks were expected upon the negro residents in
<u>MacAlister</u>, Sixth and New streets. The negroes
armed themselves, and the knowledge of this in-
creased the excitement. But we did not know that
it produce any known measure of precaution on
the part of the police, to preserve the peace of the
city.
   Before eight o'clock in the evening, a mob, the
principal organization of which, we understand,
was arranged in Kentucky, openly assembled in
Fifth street market, unmolested by the police or ci-
tizens. The number of this mob, as they delibe-
rately marched from their rendezvous towards
Broadway and Sixth streets, is variously estimated,
but the number increased as they proceeded. They
were armed with clubs, stones, &c. &c.
   Reaching the scene of operations with shouts and
blasphemous imprecations, they attacked a negro
confectionary house on Broadway, next to Syca-
more, and demolished the doors and windows.—
This attracted an immense crowd. Savage yells
were uttered to encourage the mob onward to the
general attack upon the negroes. About this time,
before 9 o'clock, J. W. <u title="Piatt (in Hazard's Register, and elsewhere)">Platt</u>, in a way highly cred-
itable to himself, addressed the mob, exhorting
them to peace, obedience to law, and to retire
without further violence. His voice was drowned
by the violent shouts of the mob, and the throwing
of stones. At this time, we verily believe, a de-
termined corps of fifty or one hundred men, would
have dispersed the crowd. The Mayor came up
and addressed the people, in a very proper way.—
The savage yell was instantly raised—“down with
him!”—“run him off”—were shouted and inter-
mixed with horrid <u title="imprecations and exhortations to (in Hazard's Register)">imprecations to</u> the mob to
move onward. We took some pains to ascertain
who these leading disturbers of the peace were, and
think a large portion of the leaders, and the most
violent, came from the other parts, were strangers
—some were said to be connected with river navi-
gation, and were strongly backed by boat hands of
the lowest and most violent order. They advan-
ced to the attack with stones, &c. &c., and were
repeatedly fired upon by the negroes. The mob
scattered, but immediately rallied again, and again
were in like manner repulsed. Men were wound-
ed on both sides, and carried off—and many re-
ported dead. The negroes rallied several times,
advanced upon the crowd, and most unjustifiably
fired down the street into it, causing a great rush
down the street.
   These things were repeated until past 1 o'clock,
when a party procured an iron six pounder from
near the river, loaded with boiler punchings, &c.,
and hauled it to the ground, against the exhorta-
tions of the Mayor and others. It was posted on
Broadway and pointed down Sixth street. The
yells continued, but there was a partial cessation of
the firing. Many of the negroes had fled to the
hills. The attack upon houses recommenced with
the firing of guns, on both sides, which continued
during most of the night—and exaggerated rumors
of the killed and wounded, filled the streets. The
cannon was discharged several times.
   About 2 o'clock, a portion of the military, upon
the call of the Mayor, proceeded to the scene of
disorder, and succeeded in keeping the mob at bay.
<d>[Col.4]</d>
In the morning and throughout the day, several
blocks, including the battle ground, were sur-
rounded by sentinels, and kept under martial law
—keeping within, the negroes there, and adding to
them such as were brought during the day, seized
without particular charge, by parties who scoured
the city, assuming the authority of the law.
   A meeting of citizens was held at the Court
House on Saturday morning, at which the Mayor
presided. This meeting was addressed by the
Mayor, Judge Read, Mr. <u>Platt</u>, Sheriff Avery, and
Mr. Hart. They resolved to observe the law, to
discountenance mobs, invoked the aid of the civil
authorities to stay the violence, and pledged them-
selves to exertion in aid of the civil authority to ar-
rest and place within reach of the law, the negroes
who wounded the two white boys on Columbia
street. That the Township Trustees enforce the
law of 1807, requiring security of negroes—pledg-
ing themselves to enforce it to the letter, until the
city “is relieved of the effects of modern abolition-
ism,” assuring “our Southern brethren,” to carry
out that “act in good faith”—and to deliver “up,
under the law of Congress, forthwith,” every negro
who escapes from his master and comes within <u title="our (in Hazard's)">the</u>
borders. They requested the Mayor, Sheriff, and
the civil authorities, to proceed at once to the
dwellings of the blacks, and disarm them of all of-
fensive weapons—and recommending search for
offenders against the laws, immediate legal pro-
ceedings against them, and an efficient patrol to
protect the persons and property of the blacks, du-
ring the existence of the present excitement, and
until they give the bonds required by the act of
1807 or leave the city. They requested the parents
and guardians of the boys to keep them at home, or
away from the scene of excitement. They “<i>Re-
solved</i>, That we view with abhorrence the pro-
ceedings of the Abolitionists in our city, and that
we repudiate their doctrines, and believe it to be
the duty of every good citizen by all lawful means
to discountenance every man who lends them his
assistance.” These resolutions were reported by
a committee composed by Messrs. J. W. <u>Platt</u>, J.
C. Avery, R. A. Madison, J. C. Vaughan, B. Sto-
rer, D. T. Disney, J. Read, J. Goodin, and N. W.
Thomas. They were adopted unanimously, signed
by the Mayor of the city, Col. Davies, as President
of the meeting, and Edward Woodruff, the Presi-
dent of the City Council, as their Secretary, print-
ed in handbills, and posted in all parts of the city.
   The City Council also held a special session,
and passed resolutions invoking the united exer-
tions of orderly citizens to the aid of the authori-
ties—to put down the violent commotion existing
in the city, to preserve order and vindicate the law
against the violence of an excited and lawless
mob—requesting all officers, watchmen, and fire-
men to unite for the arrest of all rioters and viola-
tors of law, and the Marshal to increase his depu-
ties to any number required, not exceeding five
hundred, to preserve life and protect property—re-
quiring the Mayor and Marshal to call in the aid of
the county militia to preserve order, and the Cap-
tain of the Watch to increase his force. These
proceedings were posted in handbills. Intense ex-
citement continued during the day, the mob and
their leaders boldly occupying the streets without
arrest, or any effort to arrest any of them that we
have heard of.
   The negroes held a meeting in a church, and
respectfully assured the Mayor and the citizens
that they would use every effort to conduct as or-
derly, industrious, and peaceable people, and to
suppress any imprudent conduct among their popu-
lation, and to ferret out all violators of order and
law—deprecated the practice of carrying about
their persons any dangerous weapon, pledged
themselves not to carry or keep any about their
persons or houses, and expressed their readiness to
surrender all such. They expressed their readi-
ness to conform to the law of 1807, and give bonds
or to leave within a specified time—and tendered
their thanks to the Mayor, watch officers, and gen-
tlemen of the city, for the efforts made to save
their property, their lives, their wives and chil-
dren.
   At 3 P. M. the Mayor, Sheriff, Marshal, and a
<u title="portion">porion</u> of the police, proceeded to the battle
ground, and there, under the protection of the mili-
tary, though in the presence of the mob, and so far
controlled by them, as to prevent the taking away
of any negroes, upon their complying with the
law, several negroes gave bond and obtained the
permission of the authorities to go away with sure-
ties, some of our most respectable citizens, but
were headed even within the military sentinels and
compelled to return within the ground. It was re-
solved to embody the male negroes, and march
them to jail for security, under protection of mili-
tary and civil authority. From 250 to 300 negroes,
including sound and maimed, were with some dif-
ficulty marched off to the jail, surrounded by the
military and officers, and a dense mass of men, wo-
men, and boys, confounding all distinction between
the orderly and disorderly, accompanied by deafen-
ing yells. They were safely lodged, and still re-
main in prison, separated from their families. The
crowd was in that way dispersed.
   Some then supposed we should have a quiet night
—but others more observing, discovered that the
lawless mob had determined on further violence, to
be enacted immediately after night fall. Citizens
disposed to aid the authorities were invited to as-
semble, enroll themselves, and organize for action.
The military were ordered out, and firemen were
out, clothed with authority as a police band. A-
bout 80 citizens enrolled themselves as assistants
of the Marshal, and acted during the night under
his directions, in connection with <u title="Judge (in Hazard's)">Sudge</u> Torrence,
who was selected by themselves. A portion of
force was mounted. A troop of horse, and several
companies of volunteer infantry continued on duty
until near midnight. Some were then discharged
to sleep upon their arms. Others remained on
duty till morning, guarding the jail, &c.
   As was anticipated, the mob, efficiently organ-
ized, early commenced operations, dividing their
force and making attacks at different points, thus
distracting the attention of the police. The first
successful onset was made upon the printing estab-
lishment of the Philanthropist. They succeeded
in entering the establishment, breaking up the
press, and running with it, amidst savage yells,
down through Main street to the river, into which
it was thrown. The military appeared in the alley
near the office, interrupting the mob for a short
time. They escaped through the by ways, and
when the military retired, returned to their work
of destruction in the office, which they completed.
Several houses were broken open in different parts
of the city, occupied by negroes, and the windows,
doors and furniture, totally destroyed. Among
such is the confectionary establishment of Burnet
near the upper market—a shop on Columbia, near
Sycamore—the negro church on 6th street, and
four or five houses near it—a small frame house
near the synagogue on Broadway, and several
houses on Western row near the river. One of their
last efforts was to fire or otherwise destroy the book
establishment of Messrs. Truman & Smith, on
Main street. From this they were driven by the
police, and soon after, before daylight, dispersed
from mere exhaustion, whether to remain quiet or
to recruit their strength for renewed assault, we
may know before this paper is circulated.
   Mortifying as is the declaration, truth requires us
to acknowledge, that our good city has been in
complete anarchy, controlled mostly by a lawless
and violent mob for twenty-four hours, trampling
all law and authority under foot. We feel this de-
gradation deeply—but so it is. It is impossible to
learn the precise number killed and wounded, ei-
ther of whites or among the negroes, probably sev-
eral were killed on both sides, and some twenty or
thirty variously wounded, though but few danger-
ously. Several of the citizen police were hurt with
stones and brick bats, which were thrown into the
crowd by the mob. The authorities succeeded in
arresting and securing about forty of the mob, who
are now in prison—others were arrested, but were
rescued or made their escape otherwise. We have
attempted a plain general narrative of these dis-
graceful <u title="proceedings">procedings</u>—have endeavored to be accu-
rate in our facts, and to narrate them in their order
of occurrence without coloring or distortion. Such
a narrative, at this time, we thought necessary to
check the exaggerated rumors which have doubtless
spread in all directions. Many of these transac-
tions occurred under our own observation, during
Friday night, and the evening and night of Satur-
day.
   We see in these outrages much to deplore, and
we see much which merits unqualified condemna-
tion, which has been done and omitted, during the
violence of these lawless excesses. But it behooves
all of us now to be calm, and firm, to prevent ano-
ther outbreak—to unite and draw out for the pre-
servation of the public peace, all good citizens.—
Many have hitherto done little to stop this destruc-
tive violence, who should unite, and we still trust
nearly all will yet unite, to restore the quiet of our
city, and efficacy to the law. Hereafter, when the
public mind is in condition to be reasoned with, we
shall speak as we think upon this subject, offend
whom it may.
   The mob was in many cases encouraged, and in
some, led on, by persons from Kentucky. They de-
clared they had been sent for, and that hundreds of
others were organized and ready to come here to rid
the city of the negroes and abolitionists.
   We ourselves heard one of these, a respectable
looking man, shouting to the mob to put down the
Mayor and others. In some cases the motions of
the mob were directed and managed by mere boys,
who suggested the points of attack and the object,
put the vote, declared the result, and led the way!
Think for one moment, a band calling themselves
<i>men</i>, disarming, carrying away and securing in
prison, the male negroes, promising security and
protection to their women and children—and while
they were confidently reposing in that security, re-
turn with hellish shouts, to attack these helpless
and unprotected persons! The cowardly character
of the attack distinctly shows the want of <i>manly
feelings</i> in the assailants. We cannot use terms
too strong to mark the leaders and instigators of
this mob—though we sincerely think there were
many honest, but misguided men engaged in it,
who will themselves regret it most deeply.
   Excitement continued during yesterday. The
Council held a meeting, and a meeting of the citi-
zens succeeded, in which the Governor, who is in
this city, with other gentlemen, took part. Reso-
lutions were adopted for an efficient organization
for the night.
			<i>Monday Morning, 3 A. M.</i>
   No disturbances have occurred in our city du-
ring the night. The different military compa-
nies were stationed at various points through the
city. Captain Taylor's troop of horse, together
with a large number of citizens, formed them-
selves into companies of about thirty each, who
kept up a patrol until about two o'clock, when
the citizens generally retired, having the military
on duty.
   O<small>NE</small> D<small>AY</small> L<small>ATER</small>.—Our yesterday's narrative of
the violent outrageous movements against the
<d>[Col.5]</d>
peace of the city, was penned amidst confusion and
excitement, and is full of inaccurate expressions,
though we have learned nothing that leads us to
doubt the main facts. The city remained quiet
when we went to press, and no farther outbreak is
immediately apprehended. The police, strength-
ened and duly organized, will keep up the most vi-
gilant <u title="reconnaissance">reconnoisance</u>, with ample reserve at com-
mand, to act at a moment's warning.
   We were informed yesterday, upon good authori-
ty, that the boys wounded up Columbia street, on
Thursday night, are doing well, and acknowledge
that they made the attack upon the negroes that
night. The number killed, if any, is yet unknown,
and the <u title="number wounded is (in Hazard's Register)">number is</u> equally uncertain. The negroes
in jail, were examined yesterday by the Committee
of Safety. There is but one additional fact, we
learned yesterday. That is, that although free in-
gress to the prison had been allowed to our Ken-
tucky neighbors, in search of fugitive slaves, but
one has been claimed from the whole mass, and he
is separated from the rest and held for proof in sup-
port of the claim.
   Since the above was written, we have learned
that the Committee of Safety have visited the jail,
and determined to proceed to-morrow to act upon
the cases of the negroes now held in confinement,
as follows: 1. To ascertain such against whom
there is any criminal charge, and detain them for
further examination. 2. As to those against whom
there is no accusation—to discharge natives and
those who have given bond under the law of 1807
—and to require bond of the others under that law,
and to discharge when it is given.—<i>Cincinnati
Gazette, Monday 6th</i>.

   T<small>HE</small> M<small>ARY</small> R<small>OGERS</small> C<small>ASE</small>.—The Courier states
that a Mrs. Loss, who keeps a small tavern on the
embankment near Weehawken, has been examined
before the Mayor, and testified that Mary Rogers,
with several young men, was at her house on the
evening of the 25th of July, and that she drank
some lemonade offered by one of them. The clothes
found were also identified by Mrs. Loss as those
worn by the unfortunate girl. Whatever other
clue has been obtained is yet kept secret.
